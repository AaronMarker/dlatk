17237,174357,"24,June,2004",2004-06-24,"    Im so tired. I think today is just one of those days. I've been dragging all day it seems like. I'm kind of bored. I should be at the Blue Note right now, but I really didn't feel like going tonight. I really dont have any money either but that's okay. There is a free concert saturday. My friend Ashley wants me to go with her. I'm thinking it might be cool. Our friends Denial are opening up for Lit. I think Lit is pretty awesome anyway, so it's just an added bonus that our friends are the opening act. It's kind of exciting. I'm really really happy for them. Blah I need to take a shower. I just feel like one. I'll feel refreshed or something. "
17238,174357,"28,July,2004",2004-07-28,"    So I started this new job this week and it seems pretty cool. It's a lot of training though. But it's okay. Hopefully i'll be making a lot of money soon. I have cramps so it sucks right now, because when I have cramps I cant sleep, and I have to get up early in the morning for training. So I probably wont be concentrating too much tomorrow. Well i'm sure nobody really cared to hear that, but hey this is my blog lol so oh well. It's not like anybody reads it anyway.   Ugh there is this really disgusting guy that keeps telling everybody that I went out with him and i'm like wtf? And my boyfriend is like wtf? Cause this guy is absolutely repulsive and he's just ick, and never in a million years would I go out with him. I'm like....ok whatever if anybody is dumb enough to believe that I would go out with him theny so be it, cause they must not really know me as a person. Cause if they did they would know that I dont cheat on my boyfriends and that this guy is totally not my style.&nbsp; So that's that.   I need to study this packet that I got from my job. I have a test tomorrow. Since i'm gonna be up anyway I might as well study right? But I just dont feel like it. I feel more like laying around on the couch curled up in a ball, cause that's just what I do when&nbsp;I have cramps. You know, maybe if I got up off my fat butt and exercised I wouldn't have cramps this bad. I'll try it, but it's highly unlikely that i'll really exercise for more than 30 seconds. Cause i'll just be like...owwww...pain. And then i'll stop. Cause....well...i'm a loser in a nut shell. AAAAHHHHHHHH I have to e-mail mary. "
25669,446275,"28,May,2004",2004-05-28,"    I just don't understand how all of these minorities - blacks, immigrants, women - got the right to vote.  Now, despite how despicable they may be, blacks and immigrants are a topic for another time, right now: women.  Women just don't really need to vote.  Everybody knows that all that they do [or should do, at least] all day is sit around the house and take care of the children while cooking and watching soap operas.  They aren't informed of political issues, they don't know what is going on in the world.  And, by golly, they should not be.  Just think, if these females started watching the news they would stop taking care of our nation, Under God's children.  In addition to this, every single time the woman has sexual relations [because, you see, the average woman is a whore.  Every good Christian knows that one should only have sex for procreation and one should never  enjoy  it.  That's against God's way.] it's equivalent to her selling her vote.  Because everybody knows that women don't really think, they just latch on to others' opinions.  So if this hypothetical woman was having sexual intercourse with a man out of wedlock [obviously they are Liberals because only Liberals have premarital sex.  this is another instance that the death penalty would come in handy] and he whispered in her ear, ""Oh woman with whom I am fornicating, won't you please vote for that Liberal candidate John Kerry?"" she would do it.  This is not the way to a good democratic system.  In another growing trend, women are getting entirely too uppity lately.  Now they want to kill their babies and get upset when the Good Christians of our nation tell them that this is unacceptable behaviour.  As one of my fellow authors pointed our ina previous post, life - as well as the soul - is formed at conception and if is the worst sin  ever  to take a human life.  These baby killer, anti-life Liberals are just the source of all evil in the world.  Masturbation is also, as a commenter pointed out, ""evil and unnatural"".  When people masturbate it is exactly like killing children.  And everybody knows why the Liberals want to kill children.  Because they are afraid that the children will grow up to be good law-abiding Republican Christians in our United States Under God Our Holy Master of America.  Just another string of examples of why Liberals are the Agents of Lucifer, the Devil and Enemy of our Lord.   "
25670,446275,"25,May,2004",2004-05-25,"    [this is a special guest submission by our dear friend Justin, who is obviously brilliant just like me.]  On May 22, the World Health Organization succumbed to the mass liberal Jewish gay conspiracy and raised the threat level of God's smite upon the gays, AIDs, to a higher level. Although they have not officially been inducted into the Axis of Evil, it seems to only be a matter of time.  Showing once again their uncanny ability to buckle under even the slightest of pressure, WHO shows yet another step in the increasingly slippery slope of liberalism infecting us in America today. Citing work by Dr Lee Jong-wook, a suspected Arab sympathizer, the liberal-leaning ""international"" organization sought to overcome the ""stigma"" and ""discrimination"" of having HIV or AIDs.  This is where I must disagree. AIDs is God's punishment upon homosexuals, and any stigma it incurs is well deserved. After all, in a recently conducted study, over 90% of America's favored a heterosexual president over a homosexual president. Disturbing God's natural order would be like sticking a very personal part of your body into a beehive - of course, I wouldn't put it past liberal's like Bill Clinton!  Officials from WHO also spoke about the need to ""prevent and treat HIV/AID."" Well, yeah, if by ""prevent"" you mean ""stop engaging in homosexual sex"" and by ""treat"" you mean ""hellfire and damnation."" You say your average American doesn't know this? Well I'll be darned, and the public school system was doing so well!  Sorry to bore all of you that pay attention to Fox News with this - I know you already know.   "
25671,446275,"24,May,2004",2004-05-24,"    Another thing that is terribly wrong with Liberals:  they allow websites like  urlLink Erowid.org  to exist.  As we all know, marijuana is the scourge of the devil.  It steals young children from their religious beliefs and leads them down the path of drug abuse and whatnot.  They start smoking the marijuana and they enter the forbidden dark gateway of  harder drugs .  They start stealing and they can only have fun by messing up their brain functions.    Is this what you want for the future of our population?  A bunch of doped up zombies wandering around looking for their next fix?  I believe in the deaht penalty and I believe in it for drug users.  Their type should not be welcome in our United States Under Our Lord Jesus Of America.   "
25672,446275,"16,May,2004",2004-05-16,"    I come back here to make another go at freeing people from their terrible liberal views and, what do I see but a comment claiming that gay people cannot get married.  Well, my friend, there you are incorrect.  As  urlLink Orson Scott Card said , homosexuals certainly can get married, they just must find a member of the opposite sex willing to marry them.  It's as easy as that.    Also, the 1st and 14th amendments may protect you but not if you're breaking the law.  Unless you are in one of the states where  urlLink engaging in homosexual behaviour  is legal, you really have no protection there.  The profile of the commenter claims that he is moving to Kansas in July, if this really is the case, I'd liek to declare that  I  am from Kansas and I know for a fact that being homosexual is illegal in our great and noble state.    I can also see that the Liberals are not only scumbags but also wimps.  They hide behind their 'anonymous' name in the comments of our great weblog thus showing that they cannot really stand up and declare their true opinions without attempting to disguise themselves.  If your views were worthwhile you would not state them anonymously.   "
25673,446275,"16,May,2004",2004-05-16,"    As any good Christian knows, cloning is evil because clones do not have souls. Only people born naturally have souls, and they get these souls at the moment of conception when they become real people just like you and me. (unless you are a democrat, they don't have souls)   Now, those of you who know anything about me know that I think trying to save endangered species or protect the environment is a very bad idea. It would cost good, Christian, corporations a lot of money, and if God wanted all the animals to live he wouldn't have made them so delicious, or their habitats so fun to destroy.  Now you are probably wondering, what do these two evils, cloning and the environment, have to do with each other? Well, I'll show you. Some crazy liberals have combined the two to commit the most heinous of sins,  urlLink cloning pandas !!  I find this appalling, naturally. It's unnaturaly and against the will of God! First of all, Pandas are Chinese and therefor they are communist Athiest bears! They are not worthy of saving!  And even if they were saving Glorious Bald Eagles, that would not justify trying to play god with their evil, secular, science!   "
25674,446275,"15,May,2004",2004-05-15,"    A previous comment rather rudely pointed out to me that America not following the Geneva Convention ""makes us look like bullies to the rest of the world.""  My question to you, my conservative friends and liberal enemies, is, why shouldn't America be a bully?  Everybody knows that all of those little worthless third-world countries such as Zimbabwe, France, Iraq, Afganistan, and England would not get by if not for us!  Who do they export their goods to?  Who gives them aid when thye need it?  Who pays for them when they cannot pick up a resteraunt bill?  Yes.  That is all the Holy United Conservative States of America.  If you are not with us, you are against us.  That is the way it's been since this great country was started and this is the way it shall always be.   Also, of course Bush is a War Hero.  He is sending Americans to Fight in Iraq because he is too busy leading the country.  If he was not leading the country, our great and noble America, then all really would be lost.  We could not survive if we did not have him for president.  This is why he, himself, cannot go and fight.  He is too patriotic to do that.  Another thing about the liberals that I absolutely hate.  Waht is it with their insistence that ""under God"" should be taken out of the Pledge of Alliegience? I mean, if the founders of this country had not wnted it there, thy would nt ohave put it there.  What next?  Take our holy Lord, Saviour of Mankind, and Holy Father, our God off of money?  Out of God Bless America?  What will these liberals want?  We already know that if we give them an inch they'll next want a country.  Those liberal scumbags.  They should have been the fisrt to be put in the concentration camps.   "
25675,446275,"15,May,2004",2004-05-15,"    If those hippy liberals have their way, gays won't just be invading our homes on ""Will and Grace"", but they'll be invading the holy sanctity of marriage!   urlLink Sign the petition  and  urlLink buy a t-shirt  to show those sodomites what we think!   "
25676,446275,"15,May,2004",2004-05-15,"    I was reading a printed version of Fox News the other day and I heard of terrible atrocities being commited in our great nation.  By liberals.    The gays are marrying each other in Massachusetts; Kansas, the one state that anybodyin the old days could rely on for good, old-fashined conservative behaviour, voted AGAINST an amendment banning gay marriage, and all of the United States is in shambles.  Because of the liberals.  That John Kerry character is trying to defeat our Great Lord and War Hero, George W. Bush.  If that isn't the darndest thing then I just don't know what is.  George W. Bush stood up to those damn Iraqi terrorists that caused Septemeber 11th (along with the homosexuals, of course) and those Islamics deserve waht they got from our noble American forces in the Middle-East. They got nothing more or less than what they deserved.  Let's not forget that they brutally chopped off the head of one of our Americans AND bombded our World Trade Center.  Everbody who is anybody knows that this Kerry monster is a fraud, anyway.  He THREW his medals at the WHITE HOUSE to protest the VIETNAM WAR.  But, you know, he was greedy and didn't really throw the medals that he'd earned (earned by lying and cheating, that is.  unlike our George W. Bush who wanted the war in Viet-Nam) he threw copies of the medals or just the ribbons.  Waht a fraud.  He makes me sick.  That Kerry bastard.    Wow, I was listening to the radio today and some of that music should really be banned.  It's just profane.  I dont see how anybody can be allowed to listen to it.  All of their euphamisms for the private parts of males and females just makes me uncomfortable.  Plus, all of that Satanic music (rock, rap, metal) really is quite offensive.  Next teenagers will stop going to church like I do every three days.    Then our country will really go downhill.  Love forever, Anastasia (me@ithinkso.org)   "
16774,483266,"17,May,2004",2004-05-17,"   Well, another year ticks on and I make it to 33! WOW - Where has the last year gone ?  I know that the last 48 hours for me has been quite full on ! Started on Friday with my birthday - It was nice, thanks Tina and co :-) A nice easy transition into 33.  Saturday was then another memorable day. Why ? Well it was my leaving do from my current work place. A nice evening with friends from the ward at Gino's Italian pizza restaurant.  Thanks to: Nikki, Mandy, Karen, Marie, Mary, Helen, Margs, Tracey, Lisa and Wayne all for coming - and thanks to everyone else on the ward for their time, support and encouragement - Cheers :-)  Sunday was then a lovely day out to the sun and a trip to the Torquay region of Devon. Was so nice, thought I would include some photos taken on the day:    The village of Cockington    Brixham Harbour - 1    Brixham Harbour - 2  What a lovely day out - TOP. Went with my Mum and wife :-)  Then onto today !! First day of my new job.  An induction week which kicked off with the annual drug update :-/  And that was my weekend :-)  "
16775,483266,"13,May,2004",2004-05-13,"   Well, my new job is looming on Monday, and far be it from me to not make an effort. As my hair was getting rather long, I decided it was time for a crop.  The last two hair dressers have closed since I started visiting them (not sure if there is a connection there) so I tracked down a new one to try.  Whilst sat in the chair, I thought - what the hell!! Lets get radical. My old friend Mr Rudd always has his cropped and chopped, so I thought I would give it a go. The hair dresser then informed me that you can now get a grade 8 trimmer which was quite popular in today's trends.  So I went for it: Grade 8 all over the top and grade 3-4 at the back. You judge for yourself.    Before    After  "
16776,483266,"12,May,2004",2004-05-12,"   Anyone that owns an XBOX and knows a little bit about the current E3 computer fair will be as excited as I am about the new Halo 2 Multiplayer video available to watch.     Not seen it? Trust me, it's AWESOME !  "
16777,483266,"12,June,2004",2004-06-12,"   Well - it's finally happened.  We're gonna have a baby :-)  Ye haww !!  Sometime of just yet. For those that know me, keep an eye on the bump blog for the latest details.  COOL !  "
16778,483266,"01,June,2004",2004-06-01,"   After rushing across Exeter in the mad rush hour traffic, I finally made it to the Odeon to go watch The Day After Tomorrow.  Bugger !  Sold out - So next on the list was the latest Harry Potter movie, the one where someone escapes from a prison.  I'm not sure if it was because I was looking forward to the other movie but to be honest, I found the movie kinda boring !  It didn't really grab my attention, and seemed really blank and drawn out in places. There are some nice special effects, especially I thought the moving tree and the horse come chicken come bird creature.  None the less, there was nothing ground breaking just more of the same but done better.  Still, at least I have TDAT to look forward to still :-)  "
16779,483266,"01,June,2004",2004-06-01,"   For me, someone who can't help but take things apart, it was only a matter of time before my XBOX got taken apart. Now I've done it I'm even more excited than before. The potential is huge !!  That little buty could be re-built into anything - only my imagination is the limit !!     Compact little bugger ain't she ?      Why! It's a PC in a box, crying to be modded !   I'll post any pics of final systems.  "

Hi Big, yes as a matter of fact i have run into this in dealing with my own family's care, I know this is  hard to deal with a physicain in this manner and all i can offer you is this. Do not waste your  time wth him, He is obveously to lazy and uneducated to deal with the fact that add/adhd is real.  Get yourself another physician. you may even want to research the physicians a bit, before you make  a choice. I actually recieved a letter from a physician  at the center concerning one of the kids   that i get in the mornings saying the same darn thing. Yes dealing with people especialy  physicians can make us very angry, I have been struggleing with  a few here for a while you just can not get through. i have learned they are just not worh the  argument.   biganburly   wrote: As many of you know, I recently relocated to Florida.   As part of  getting my life back in order, I found and went to a new primary care  physician.  While discussing my medical history in detail with this  doctor, I brought up my history of ADD.  I was flabbergasted to hear  the doctor respond by saying that he didn't believe that ADD was a  real disorder, but rather one that was created in the late 60's and  early 70's to account for those that just couldn't deal with hard  work and discipline. Further, he said that it took a doctor with real  guts to prescribe a methamphetamine-based stimulant to anyone, let  alone someone who couldn't focus on their responsibilities.  Yes...I was ready to strangle this guy.  Instead, I spent the next 5  minutes rattling of information, research, web addresses and relevant  anecdotes to try and convince this guy that there was more to this  story than his perceptions of laziness.  I don't think I got through.   Anyone else run into this before?  BIG   To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to: ADD_Couch-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com    Your use of Yahoo!

199,791840,"10,September,2002",2002-09-10,"    This is a Blog for the Green Family to keep in communication with each other. Please use the site for communication in the family.   9/10/2002 6:45:46 PM | Stephen Olson] Well today I was at Dr. Dwyer's and managed to do some real good work with feeling accomplished. Also Richard from the CCA took me to Granville Street and Broadway to try to get into the new course through the Vancouver School Board. This is to complete the grade 11 math that I have to complete and it's better to do this in a structured setting. All I really need is to get a transcript from the Counselling office and then mange to give this to the 41st and Fraser location the John Oliver school location.   Things that are not right for me:   1. I sometimes have difficulty with defensiveness.   2. I do have trouble with relationships that are close to me, intimacy.   3. I have trouble with working with people who are close to me intimatly.   4. I have trouble with personal awareness many times.   5. I feel that I have to ask questions to feel at ease with others so that they will accept me and so that I will stay in their boundries.   6. Taking risks is difficult for me sometimes.   7. Feeling comfortable with others has always been a challange, and sometimes doing the basic requirements of life is difficult for me.   8. Sometimes I have trouble with procrastination with things that I don't want to do.   9. Budgeting and future planning is a challange for me.   10. Organizing is fine if I have the tools to do so, and time planning usually is the most difficult because it takes the most time to do.   11. I have difficulty using the telephone correctly sometimes esp. when it comes to personal converstaions with family.   12. I find myself being very able to handle a restricted lifestyle, but when it comes to a more complexities I tend to run into problems.   13. I find knowing and using skills that I have already quite enjoyable but learning new skills seem to take time developing, especially person to person skills.   I have to say to Mom that, I need to claim my independence of family even though I am almost 40 years of age at the moment.  Mom, you have done this yourself, and have continued to do this over time. I on the other hand have a non-grown child inside of me that is not fully a developed child.   My child's development has been stiffled by the fact that I have been put in a protected environment, and the outside world has not had any way of getting to me for a long time. So obviously I could not learn about this world since I was apart from it.  My difficulty now is that I need to know more about this world and understand more fully what this world means to me personally.   Inside my confidence has not grown in the world, since I was not in the world but kept apart from the world. You, Mom, have claimed your independence, and are a fully developed adult, and I need the chance to become one myself. I am just now comming to the point where I am comming out of the house emotionally as an adolecent.   This is a very crutial point.   I can feel shure and say that I feel reall good that this time has come. I now have to learn about the world around me much more than  others who are already fully developed adults.   Yes, I have asked for help from you, Mom, and asked you to be my coach, but you have to understand something. A child does whine, and cry when they are not feeling safe and a teenager does go against the wishes of their parents. I never really rebeled, I never really stated my independence from you.   I feel that I need to claim this independence, and state my position and claim my individualness as every adult has done.  I understand that nobody really rebells outrightly most of the time but they do claim their space and their own area of personal development.  You already know that I am very independent, and have always been independent and have had a hard time being together with another person because of my need for freedom.  This need for freedom, is very important for me.  I need to feel free enough to be able to state myself, and be free thinking.  As well as this motion is very important to me.  I need to be able to get away from things physically, and exert energy to this end.    I also need to have home as a place of rest and relaxation, and a place to get away from the world and escape into my own reality.  I ask for your help, and for Ron's, but I need this in moderation.  The problem for me is figuring out what moderation is.  What I need help with is finding out the middle ground, and the moderate.  I tend to do the extream thing whatever it may be. I tend to go beyond what is normal, and I don't do enough of what is within the boundries of normal.  The idea here generally is that I need to be moderated, but in a way that is not so direct maybe.   "

31331,1039908,"24,June,2004",2004-06-24,"    MOPSY 1 	Wandering aimlessly seems to be a thing of pleasure for her, these days. Marianneâ€™s sense of romance lets her connect collapsing in a graceful pool of cloak and limbs with skinning the soles of her feet on a hot sidewalk, and getting one more concussion from fainting along the way. Her hallucinations and the wild heat aid her. She smiles faintly when I struggle to pick her up, fluttering her hand at me as if to say she cannot do it herself, but that it is not worth the trouble. I think she is worth the trouble, and know she tries not to grunt when I put her across my shoulders and carry her home. Sometimes the walk home is very long, and I see that it is a large distance she has walked. Then, there are more and more frequent pauses as I stop to catch my breath, and listen for her slow breathing. Sometimes she has only just made it around the corner of our street, and then I turn around to see the curtains falling back down, the neighbors pretending not to have been watching. I would not look at them if I was Marianne, but I think she does. I think Marianne sees a lot of things I would not want to see if I were her. 	When she is back on the drooping couch, she does not look at me. I intend to fix the sofa; I will give it proper cushions with full ends and upholstery that doesnâ€™t remind us of nineteen eighty-two. I will take away the brown-flowered curtains in her bedroom, and find clean white ones to go in their stead. The rugs should not be faded, the bed should not sag and creak the way it does, and there should be neither linoleum nor a plastic table cover in the kitchen. Marianne never thought that being an invalid would mean old red and green and beige and pale blue flowered sheets to hide the stains from when she could not keep herself from coughing in the night. She did not think there would be coughing in the day, too, and that some of it would be done in bed. I never (have never, do never, will never) ask her why she walks barefoot out the door sometimes, so long that I must go find her. I would not want to sleep on a tired, springy bed with stained sheets either. I do anyway. 	Finally, Marianne looks up at me from the couch. I am sitting in the armchair across the room, watching her and waiting for the present moment. She wants to ask me what we shall do this afternoon. Anything you like, I can say, giving her the decision. She will not be able to make up her mind, and we will turn the cushions backward on the sofa to redistribute the old fluff inside. There will not be anything worth watching on the TV, and we will be admittedly too lazy to pull out a CD player, so we will just sit. My arm goes around her shoulders, she slouches against me, and everything is just the way it ought to be. I will have to push her away, then, because her skin is too hot and I am afraid that I will begin to burn if she does not let go of me soon.  	Sitting on the sofa this way will only make new sofa memories over the old ones, and I do not want to revise the past. I will not suggest or move or even look to sitting with my arm around her on the left and left-middle gap cushions because I remember when her skin was cool. She did not cough so very much then (and coughing rubbish up was rare). Marianne and I are quite well matched, I think. The neighbors say so, and they laugh. Mr. and Mrs. Chotky have their prejudice intact (Marianne sees them and smiles all the same), but I happen to know that Marianne is not going to ask me what to do this afternoon because she does not want me to pull away from her. She knows what I am thinking. This is good. Even fevered people can be soul mates. Even fevered people can read minds, if they could before. 	There are many things that Marianne can do, these days. She can walk half a mile, in shoes, without fainting. She can, usually, dress herself. She can manage our calendar; every so often she will update it with colored crayons to mark the days in which we will go to a park or a museum or Ikea to sit on the furniture. I am teaching her to make pancakes from the bag, and she is teaching me to bake brownies from the box. Sometimes she has trouble with the flipping and the mixing, but that is why I am here. My arms are fairly strong, she says, though my culinary genius does not yet extend beyond pre-packaged food. I try not to remember that she does not have the energy to stand and work for longer than it takes to make boxed brownies. She particularly likes the interval between opening the box and eating the brownies, when she can watch me become befuddled and laugh. Youâ€™re learning, she says, you have to be the one to sort the process out. I laugh too, of course, and if the brownies are miserable because I forgot the yoghurt this time, we laugh again. She can laugh a lot, these days. 	One day, I bring her a book that I have bought in the subway station on the way home from work. I have a part-time job in an architectâ€™s office as a kind of gopher, only they pay me more because they know my girl is terminally ill. We deny that it is terminal, but accept the money anyway. Perhaps someday Iâ€™ll get a real job there, and move up the totem pole? Twenty-six and Iâ€™m only starting off. I think weâ€™ll be okay. Marianne protests that she is not okay- She does not really want the book I brought today, or the cards from yesterday, or the disposable camera from the day before. She wants me home, of course, she wants to be well again, and she wants a bottle of Lysol to clean her sheets with. I tell her that she might not want Lysol for her sheets, but she is adamant.  	In the end, we strip the bed and dunk the sheets in Clorox. We soak and drown and inundate the sheets with Clorox. [The sheets] are now slightly closer to white than they were before, but have mostly faded into beige. She is begging me for brooms, for vacuums, which we have, and for heavy duty window cleaner and ammonia based cleaning products, which we havenâ€™t. Formula 409, while probably toxic, does not smell the same way ammonia does. It is also advertised as biodegradable, and I thus see it as a good investment. Marianne does not think that Formula 409 will rid her house of the old invalid smell. Twenty-six and this is how it ends, she says. Then she looks at me solemnly, and points out in all seriousness that she intends to scrub her soul of disease with ammonia. I do not want to laugh, because she may honestly intend to wash herself with floor cleaner, and if I laugh she will swallow it just to spite me. This must be stopped. I snort accidentally, in the effort to breathe calmly through my nose. Again, I snort a little, and my mouth is twitching, so is hers, she is laughing a little, then I am, and then we both are, as ever. Marianne flips to the first page of the book I have given her and shows me that a) it is a romance novel, and b) the main character is intending to scrub her soul with something or other. She had begun reading while I was searching for Clorox, and found it devilishly amusing. I begin to wonder if she is honestly as tired of living in a sick house as I am, or if sheâ€™s only made that up to use a line. Shame upon me, because of course sheâ€™s tired of living here; Marianne is here more often than I am. Marianne is always here. 	On Saturday morning, I make a feeble attempt to sleep past nine. I do not like venturing into the real world at 6:45 daily to make money- some days I am still a teenager. Marianne is a teenager too. 8:45 AM and she is sitting on my bed, considering shaking me awake, considering staring at me until I wake up, considering doing neither, and finally just staring out of sheer nervousness that I might die if she shakes me too hard. You are fragile, she says. I wake up, of course, and ask her if I have kicked her in the night. You are fragile, I say. Then I want to kick myself, because of course she has her own room, own bed, now, with Clorox-ed sheets. I must kick myself again and again, to remember that I am not going to forget sleeping with her nearby when her skin felt white and her rubbish landed in the pot by her pillow. It is all right, of course; a slip of the tongue at 8:45 is forgiven by her because we are going to make pancakes again. She will be a fast learner and a fast talker when she gets tired. Marianne has stopped getting cranky when she is tired. She is tired often, I think. 	When we are getting ready for bed, Marianne often sits on the bathtub ledge to watch me brush my teeth. She is very philosophical, then. You know, she says, having toothpaste on your nose is like having banana on your chin. Here, I want to laugh, but doing so while brushing my teeth opens my mouth dangerously wide. I think thatâ€™s why she says the things she does, to see toothpaste dribble out of the corner of my usually neat mouth. She strikes me as so young, then, or at least so fun. Itâ€™s funny that you connect the two, she says. Twenty-six and thatâ€™s just where we are, love, twenty-six. She pauses, and I stare at the mirror, brushing heartily away; thinking. I canâ€™t say Iâ€™ve learned something from her. There is no lesson from her sickness, and I donâ€™t want there to be; lessons mean closure, and weâ€™re not finished yet. Weâ€™re going to make her well, weâ€™re going to move across the country, and weâ€™re going to be young and beautiful doing it. I grin, and lose a little toothpaste out the side of my mouth. I think weâ€™ll be fine, I say. Twenty-six is a good place for us.   "

31334,1039908,"01,July,2004",2004-07-01,"    Edge-of-Jungle Scene 	It is late afternoon, and the smaller animals are gravitating towards the watering hole. Its uneven blackness spans a large area, with a graying log floating in the center. The animals appear to avoid this potential resting spot in favor of hovering around the edges to drink and retreat into the shadows. More grey, ropey branches lie tangled across the surface of the water, from the fall of the central rotting trunk. The jungle populace holds its distance from these deadly cords, the nearest life form being a single toadstool growing in the shadows. An adventurous pale green frog has recently begun swimming near the opposite shore, but the others wait in the shadows for proof that the predators have already come and left.   Keyboard pad, keyboard, cords, paperclip bowl, post-it notes  	A large rock stands atop a nearby plateau, overlooking the watering hole. It has a smooth, thin surface, with a blackness that the pond reflects. A frequent origin of strange noises, only the tiniest and bravest of creatures seek protection here- purple speckled tree frog of the same species as the pale green swimmer, and a colony of white moths.  Computer monitor, post-its, business cards  	Off to the leftmost side of the pond, after a safe space of red earth (trampled into circles and ovals by the larger animals), a large sloth has emerged to hydrate itself. The sloth is of a very light grey, and has not moved for at least twenty minutes. It is difficult to discern which end is its head and which its tail. Neither end nor sides produces limbs of any kind. Breathing is also not visible, but it is expected that it will soon â€˜awakenâ€™ to drink and slink away. This manner of appearing dead or inanimate is a defense mechanism of the grey Jungle Sloth. Cashmere sweater 	Tree branches swing low by the right side of the water. On top of these sit a variety of birds, possibly unsure as to whether the fallen tree branches are snakes or plants. One bird, a deep brown creature of the Armanus family, has opened his wings silently, revealing tan wingtips to indicate that his status as a male of mating age. He sits triumphantly atop a red jungle worm that he has crushed into submission. It no longer struggles for freedom.  Armani glasses case, red CD case  	Behind this more colorful bird sit a collection of oddly shaped birds. The first two are crows, one starved and gaunt, and the other with a tumor on his rear end such that he appears curved up at each end. Their black feathers are no longer shiny, perhaps indicating a flight across the desert to the edge of the jungle, here. They, too, await the clearing of the watering hole. Next to these two characters sits a black vulture with a particularly bulbous head, which he swings at random moments so as to inspire fear into the sloth and the other faking-death animals. However, his possession of a bit of still-red rhinoceros carcass indicates that he is no longer on the hunt. At his side is the last crow, with longer feathers than the others, looking particularly mild for the hot weather. A cool breeze blows in, and the purple speckled frog leaps into the watering hole.

8535,1111991,"30,July,2004",2004-07-30,"   Good evening. It's day one. I can't say I ever thought I'd do this again, but it's an opportunity and as good a time as any to pour out my feelings. Craig left this morning. We were up rather late on our last night together, after he tucked Mia in and explained that ""Daddy's going on a trip tomorrow"". The alarm was set for 3 AM and when it went off it seemed like 5 minutes after I drifted off.. fighting it all the way.   He showered, put the rest of his stuff together, and we kissed and hugged and I cried and he left. It was 3:49 AM. I cried for a little while after he left and then I was stuffed up, so I sat up in bed and did the Sunday Times crossword for a while until I felt tired enough to go back to sleep for a while. At 6:30 the alarm went off for me, and I showered and got ready. Mia woke up, as happy as ever, and I got her ready. I left Craig a voice mail; I knew he wasn't taking off until 10:20, so he was still only down the road at Miramar. He called me a few minutes later and I teared up again as I let Mia tell him hello and that she was watching Zooboomafoo or whatever it was.   I took her to daycare, she sang ""Good Morning to You"" and I know how blessed I am to have her company and her giggle. It's going to get me through this, just like the love of my family, my friends & my husband. It's just hard to think about this seemingly vast amount of time right now on the first night without him. I picked her up, and on the way home, as always, she asked, ""Go home and see Daddy now?""   ""No, baby. Daddy's on a trip, he's at work, remember?""  ""Oh, Daddy go on a trip tomorrow."" Yes, Mia. Today IS tomorrow. I'm still reeling at the fact that she's finally remembering the things we talk to her about... but I'm also sure that my little OCD creature of habit will ask if we're going home to see Daddy every time I pick her up for a while now.   He flew to Seattle, called me from there at 1:30 PM PST. He was leaving for BWI in a half hour, and I told him that Mia talked about him, and that I picked up the car from the base at lunchtime. Poor thing has 29 hours of travel ahead of him, that is horrendous. He was going to BWI, then Frankfurt and then Kuwait. From there he's going to Iraq, to his home for the next seven months on a base outside Fallujah. He did promise me he wouldn't try to be a hero. I know that if for no other reason than his love for our daughter, he'll stay safe and come home to us. I know he's an incredible Marine and I respect and admire him so much.  So tonight I tucked my little Pookie in, and she helped me say a prayer for Daddy... and sang him Happy Birthday. Again. I think it might be Craig's birthday for the next few weeks, but that's ok. It makes me laugh. Craig called from BWI at 7:30 PST and told me that the next time I will hear from him is on Monday or Tuesday. At least this time I'll hear from him regularly via email & phone. That will be MUCH better than last year. *Sigh* last year... I can't believe that he had to go there again.   I'll be in here to post from time to time, and I promise it won't always be heartreaking. It's just the first day. I'm sure we have lots of fun ahead of us in the weeks & months to come, it's just a hard day to get through. Each day is one less. I'll be back in here tomorrow night at some point. Good night.   "
8536,1111991,"13,August,2004",2004-08-13,"   He called this morning. A helicopter went down earlier this week, and their communications were cut off. Which does make sense... but my imagination runs away from me when i'm worried.   Poor guy.. they're rationing water, which means only using bottled water, which means only using water to drink. Not to shower. In 110-120 degree weather. That is probably one stanky-ass place right now! Hopefully they get more water soon... those poor people on that base, it must be awful. Anyway, he's SUPER busy, which is great as it always makes the time go faster.   He needs new boots, so I bought them today & will mail them out. I have another box going with a bunch of magazines, a couple of articles, and a Costco container of Jelly Bellies (there's a tease for you, baby!... I know Craig reads this).  So in an email today and on the phone too, he said, ""No news is good news. If something bad happens, you will find out RIGHT away... so if you hear nothing, everything is fine."" I guess that's as comforting as it gets for me right now, huh?  I'm thrilled that it's Friday, especially since I have a nice busy weekend ahead! Tonight Les & Wendi are coming over for opening ceremonies. Tomorrow we have a fun birthday party to attend and then we'll go to Meesh & Bojan's to see their newly remodeled bathrooms (and them, of course). Sunday a ZOO trip with Anne & Ellie (my boss and her 3-year-old daughter, who Mia has already spent some time with...) and then hopefully a nap. then Dana's coming over! It'll fly by, but hopefully Mia will just remain happy & in a good mood (and a LISTENING mood) all weekend.   Ok, time to go home and make this yummy yakitori chicken recipe I found in the Weber cookbook... we'll see how that goes!   "
8537,1111991,"10,August,2004",2004-08-10,"   Well, I haven't heard anything from him since Wednesday morning his time, and it's now Friday night his time. At what point do I worry? I'm up at 5:30 today because I keep checking to hear that nice little mail sound and see that it's from him. But instead I get a disappointing ""thunk"". Nothing.  Logic tells me that if his power was out or Internet was down he couldn't email me... but he's been CALLING. I know they cut off communications when Marines are dying because they don't want that kind of news coming from other people via their communications home. Understandable... but unfortunately Marines have been dying too much lately, and this huge protest in Najaf is only one on a laundry list of battles going on there that is SO frustratingly not covered in the media! ARGH. He's spoiled me, that's the problem... phone calls and/or emails every day, so when this gap happens I worry. It's not like last year when no news was GOOD news during the war.  Anyway, if you get the chance, read the Salon.com article ""War? What war?"". Email me if you can't get to it, I'll send you a copy... it details the American media's continuing lack of war coverage.  Ok, I need to shower. What I need really is some communication from my husband. Maybe today.   "
8538,1111991,"10,August,2004",2004-08-10,"   Just when I've had a few bad days, Monday (of all days) comes and Mia is back in my heart. Of course I don't stop loving her to pieces, but some days are inherently better than others.  FIrst of all, I spoke to Craig this morning. Thankfully this time he paged me after I wasn't at my desk! Well, jeez, it's not like I can call him back! Anyway, he sounds good... ready for the turnover & to settle in to his permanent digs. Right now he has to wait for the guy he's replacing to leave before he can have his space. It's still hot... I felt horrible after I said it was hot here, realizing that was a ridiculous thing to say. (It is, for San Diego standards... but as in many cases, I'm sure he'd trade me) He told me that the ""Swiss Steak"" they had last night could have been camel..haha. But I got to speak with him for a while, tell him about Mia's weekend more, and ask what he thought of the pictures. He wisely stated, as I'd also previously heard, that often the ""threes"" are worse than the ""twos"". Sometimes in the middle of fighting with your 2-year-old you don't look at the bigger picture; EVERYONE deals with this to some extent. Kids can be rotten sometimes, but man does the good far outweigh the bad. And so he told me that he could look at 100 Mia pictures each day and still look at more. Of course, I know that... I can't imagine being so far away from her for so long. Baby, she misses you too... I promise.  Today I went to Costco with the full intention of buying soy milk for Mia and a couple of birthday presents for kids whose parties we will be attending. Then I saw the PUPPETS! They had these adorable glove puppets, there were 4 in each set; one was ocean creatures, one was jungle, one was farm animals and one was zoo animals or something like that. $6.89 a set. Yes, you read correctly. So what's a good Jewish mother to do? I bought the ocean creatures and the jungle animals! I have no will power when it comes to getting stuff for Mia. I also got her the Eric Carle book  The Very Busy Spider ; same dude who did  The Very Hungry Caterpillar . Or, ""Caddapidda"" in Mia-speak.   So I was very excited to share the book, but figure I'll save the puppets for a desperate moment! So I picked up Mia, and thankfully she had a normal poop today (anyone reading this knows my woes I think, if you care at all and I haven't told you, let me know and I can fill you in), she greeted me with the usual enthusiasm, and Miss Mary said her day was great. I had her snack in the car, she climbed in her seat without hesitation, probably due to the fact that her alphabet book was waiting for her. She tells me what letter all the words start with, and the other way around.   ""What starts with 'C', Mommy?"" ""Tell me, baby."" ""'Camel on the Ceiling!'""  I think it took her all of a week to memorize that book.. and it's the WHOLE alphabet!  She LOVES books. More than ever. I can't explain how much she loves her books, she brings them in the car, and when I do NOT have her favorite handful of them along, she gets so upset. So, I explained that the  Are You My Mother  book was at home, and I'd read it as SOON as we got there. That seemed to satisfy her. Then we got home, and I made her some chicken while I cleaned for a bit (tomorrow I'm getting the living/dining room steam cleaned and then going out at night, so it should be neat for Meesh who's babysitting), and then while she ate she was looking at books. Surprise. I folded laundry, put some more in, and realized it was 6:40 already. I hadn't showed her the new book! I told her, ""Mia, Mommy got you a new BOOK today!"" ""ooooooooh!!"" ""Want me to read it to you?"" ""YEAH! OK... read it to ME?"" She ran to where I was standing, and I showed her the book. ""What's this on the cover?"" ""A SPIDERman."" ""Just a spider, Mia."" ""A SPIDER!"" ""Ok, let me get my water, and we'll read the book."" ""Mommy, I go poopoo, need change diaper."" Hm. She already did that today. As I got closer, I realized she was not kidding... ""Ok, let's change your diaper, and THEN I'll read the book."" She very hesitantly agreed, insisting on bringing two smaller board books with her, two favorites;  Are You My Mother  and  Mr. Brown Can Moo . She was standing by the changing table, and then she handed me the books. I put them on the side of the dresser, picked her up & changed her. Much protest involved due to the sand that came off her previously shod feet and went into her face while I hoisted her legs, poor baby! So I finished to exclamations of,  ""OK! Read BOOK! OK!"" I sat on the couch, grabbed the ""Spiderman"" book, and she came to sit - but no, she didn't. She stopped. ""OOPS! Be right back,"" she said. She RAN back to her room, grabbed the two books that I'd left there, came running back with them, put them on the couch next to her, and then sat to listen. SHE WAS LINING UP FUTURE BOOKS TO READ! Not to mention the memory of what had just happened... amazing. Brain development right before my eyes. I laughed and hugged her. She said, ""Tiss?"" (kiss) and I did. ""Hugs?"" and i did. And I was SO smart, that when I got to the last book, I said,  ""Ok, after THIS one, it's bath time."" Small whine. ""What happens after this book, Mia?"" "".... it's baf-time."" RIGHT! awesome, it worked! And sure enough, as soon as it was over, she HAPPIILY marched into the bath! Bath was great, she's finally clean, and I stand her up on the table to put her PJ shirt on. Across the room she spots  Where the Wild Things Are . This is another new favorite, and it's the nice hard-cover version from my brother & his wife that she got for her 1st birthday. I've only recently been courageous enough to let her touch it, she's very good though. ""MOMMY! Read THAT book??!?!"" I turned around, I'd forgotten I'd even brought it IN there, and she had to crane her neck to see it... wow. ""OK."" So we walked out, I gave her milk, explaining that I'd read it AFTER milk and tooth-brushing. I said, ""One book, just this one, and then bedtime.... what happens after I read this book, Mia?"" ""Bed time."" YESSSSSS!!!!!! And what a fabulous bedtime it was. Amazing day. More tomorrow if I get the time. This novel was for YOU, baby!!   "
8539,1111991,"09,August,2004",2004-08-09,"   Sorry, gang (or anyone who's reading this) it HAS been a while!   Let's see... Craig is doing well. The Gunny he's replacing is leaving soon, and then he'll have the place to himself. This includes (and according to Craig, he's ""living like a Colonel"") his own twin bed, shower & nice big cement walls to decorate! So if you're going to snail mail anything to him, let me know so that you can send something appropriate.  I'm not as sad for right now... but Mia's definitely starting to notice that he's gone. She was a disciplinary nightmare for most of the weekend, and usually the team effort we have going is a huge help. From the moment I fell for him, I always knew Craig & I were meant for each other. But I had no idea what a great parenting team we would be! He is an amazing backup for comforting, discipline, FUN, anything that Mia needs. He is missed in that department for sure.   She occasionally will hit me now, that's not accepted; and I feel AWFUL because I just take her wrist in my hand and sternly say, ""NO hitting! Hitting hurts mommy!"" and she begins to cry her eyes out. Not the reaction I'm looking for, you know? I mean of course she's going to feel bad when I'm angry, but I want her to feel more apologetic and LEARN from it, not break down in a sad fit of bawling. I guess it's the age. She's still only so-so with sharing too, but that will come. I just need her to LISTEN to me! I feel like a skipping record, ""Mia, don't touch. Mia, put that down. Mia, put it down. Mia, come here and do this, put that down. Do you HEAR me? Put it DOWN!"" If we're in public, people must think I have a screw loose... I try to make her repeat what I say, but she won't. I just don't understand how someone THAT smart, and with that accute of a sense of hearing (she hears a plane, helicopter, truck, crying baby, anything like Radar from M*A*S*H - before any other human ears hear it) can NOT listen. But yet if it's something she doesn't CARE to hear (mostly things out of MY mouth), she tunes out. Welcome to selective hearing, Mom. This will be in place for at least 16 more years.  Ok, after the bad, the good; I got her a PRECIOUS pair of pink, orange & white flip-flops. (available for viewing at  urlLink The Bowman Web Page ) they're Reef brand, and they were only $7. (I checked.. they're $14 at Nordies! HA!) So I bought them because I could NOT resist, and I wasn't so sure about the size. I left the tags on, and as we arrive at a restaurant to meet Meesh for a happy hour drink after work on Friday, I put one of them up to the bottom of Mia's shoe she was wearing. They were perfect. Mia spotted it as I held it for all of 3 seconds, yanks off her shoe & sock and says, ""I want to WEAR!"" pointing at the flip-flops!  ""You want to wear these now?"" ""OK!"" (If you have MET Mia, you know about her love for ""OK!"")  So, I helped her take off her other shoe & sock, and cut off the tags on the shoes. I helped her to put them on, she became and instant pro, and I said, ""Those are so pretty!"" She looked up, mouth in a wide-open smile, and said, ""LOOK at my TOES!"" I said, ""Those are 'flip-flops'.""  ""FLEEP Flops!"" She showed Michelle 40 times, she kept telling the waitress about them, ""Look at my FLEEP flops. Look at my TOES!"" it was classic. She woke up on Saturday morning and the moment I opened her door she said, ""I want to wear FLEEP flops!"" So obviously there was a huge breakdown when I wanted her to wear ANY other shoes, but she got over it. The scene is so darn CUTE!  We did have our Sunday morning at Starbucks. She wanted to take 4 books with her, and she's always playing with stuff and pretending it's a backpack, so I had an idea. I got out the backpack we bought for her for school and said, ""want to take them in this?"" ""OK!"" I helped her put them in, and she carried them to Starbucks, proud as a peacock. Now she needs to master how to unzip and zip it, but that's another time...   Ok, time to go. I hope you're enjoying the pictures & the stories, everyone. This weekend we have a birthday party & a zoo trip in store! Also a visit with Auntie Dana. Wendi tells me there's a community pool with a water park.. maybe we can find time to hit that soon too.

8540,1111991,"04,August,2004",2004-08-04,"   It's now Wednesday, it's been almost a week. Even though Mia & I have colds, I'm in much better spirits. I know he's safe, we've talked on the phone a couple of times, and I'm making plans. I spoke with Ayelet the other night, we had a great conversation. Also spoke with my mom who I think worries that I'm depressed; I open my email each day to find an e-card from her wishing me a great day. It's sweet... I'm sure she has no idea what to do.   Just spoke with Lauren for a while tonight, which was great. It's nice to wrap my mind around what's going on in someone else's life, even if only for an hour or so. She's doing well, sounds happy... is one of many of my friends that is doing work on her house at the moment. Construction abounds out here! We made plans to see each other in a couple of weeks. This weekend hopefully I'll spend time with Les & Wendi, Meesh & Bojan, and I'm sure I'll just be making sure that Mia & I are healthy again. The weather is amazing, it's cooled off quite a bit. I've turned off the A/C and opened the windows.  Work is keeping me REALLY busy. It's going well, though; I heard today that we hooked Assemblywoman Christine Kehoe to speak at our Political Action Committee golf tournament fundraiser. That is a nice little coup.   I'm also planning to see Bebel GIlberto (daughter of very famous Joao - see  Girl From Ipanema ) at the Belly Up toward the end of August. A few people from work are leaving after next week so there's a going away party. Hopefully someone can sit for Mia so that I can go.  Mia's doing so great... she seems like she understands somehow. We went to the store today and she sat in the cart (I should specify that it's a cart with a seat for kids, not just the regular cart) and behaved so nicely. She held a box of Spongebob Squarepants mac & cheese the whole time, telling me about the jellyfish & starfish on the box. Others would pass us in the aisles and smile at her and give me the ""She is ADORABLE"" look. I can't say I disagree. It seems like I'm barely treading water in being able to avoid tantrums or curtail ones that have began, and she's getting smarter and smarter so those tactics are ceasing to be effective. Her memory is improving at an alarming rate, as is her speech ability. It's getting much tougher to fool or outsmart her. I guess it's a learning experience for both of us! The funny thing is, sometimes it works to my advantage, and i don't want to let on... For example, tonight, we got home from Vons and I had a bunch of bags in the trunk. As I struggled since I only wanted to make one trip, she stood looking and started shouting ""I want to carry! I want to carry!""  ""You want to carry bags with me?"" ""yeah."" GREAT! I handed her a couple of lighter bags, and she brought them inside so happily you'd think I'd let her have candy or something! Keeping that one in mind...hehe.  OK, it's sleep time. I'm fighting this cold and need my rest. Good night.   "
8541,1111991,"01,August,2004",2004-08-01,"   Craig called me late this morning, he's there. 130 degrees in Kuwait... I thought with all that flying time, maybe they screwed up and took him to a base on Mars instead. He sounded fine, he was soaking with sweat, and definitely happy the plane part was over. He did say that the Gunny he's replacing has things pretty hooked up out there. I expect we'll all get pictures soon. If you care, the time difference is 11 hours (PST, anyway), so when he called me at 10:15 AM or so, it was 9:15 PM there. So you east coast people can do your own math..hehe.  Had a good day with Mia and of course I regret not having the camera with me. We played on a great playground near Les & Wendi's, and Mia had a ball. I'm pretty sure Jake did too... he called Wendi ""mama"" for the first time. Well, actually, the second, but the first time you don't really believe it so with babies you wait until it happens again before you get excited. Mia was pretty good, all things considered. She REALLY had fun at the pool. She was previously very apprehensive about being in the pool. In my opinon, she saw Jake's lack of fear and said, ""screw this... if he can go in there, I can go in there,"" and proceeded to jump into my arms from the edge of the pool. Repeatedly. Hm! Guess now I can worry about her around bodies of water... swim lessons next summer for SURE!   I appreciate all of my friends here, your comments, your prayers, positive thoughts.. and WILL take up each and every one of you on your offers! Mia and I WILL travel a bit, I'm buying her a Wiggles sleeping bag that's attached to an air mattress; I'll bet you all that she'll love that thing more than her bed! And I know that now & then even a movie or a dinner out with grown-ups will be very therapeutic. I'm looking forward to it, every bit of it passes time. And I know that Mia is so much better with familiar and fun friends, that's such a huge help to me. (Julie, I mentioned your name in the car yesterday with Stuart, and she fully started talking about you! it was too cute.)   Fabulous conversation with Julie LIttle-Nickson tonight.. she apparently was put in charge of getting a gift for Michael Moore and gave it to him at a cocktail reception at the DNC in Boston last week and he CRIED. She had quite an incredible time with him. Sounds like she enjoyed the convention very much. She & her hubby are headed to the wine regions of France on Saturday, it sounds incredible.   Ok, it's 10:15, start of a new month, a new work week... and one more week closer to my guy returning. Good night, all.   "
8542,1111991,"01,August,2004",2004-08-01,"   I was woken up by my daughter stomping on the wall that connects to my room! Talk about a rude awakening. Ah the fun of the ""big girl bed"".  Lumpy... I'm not a closet  OC  watcher, I'm a FULL-ON out of the closet  OC  watcher! I love that show, and I fully know it's a guilty pleasure. Another few favs:  Six Feet Under  (actually, ANY HBO show, it's just that  Six Feet Under  is on right now),  Big Brother, Amazing Race , and coming up.. the Olympics. That will be a great time-filler! In the fall there will be lots of good new stuff too. I'm a HUGE  CSI  fan, so the New York one is coming and that'll be great. I'm sure there will be more diversions.  Mia's watching Pooh right now at 7:15 AM on a Sunday, and I'm in here wiping the sleep out of my eyes. Yesterday I went to the Carlsbad outlet mall with ""Uncle Stu"" who Mia had a complete blast with. She really is much easier now that she's friendly with our friends and can stand to be away from me for a short while. However, I didn't bring her stroller so much of the day was spent repeating myself like some kind of idiot.... ""Mia, come here.  Mia, come here. Don't touch that. Don't touch that. Don't touch that! I said come HERE!"" She usually listens.. there was too much freedom yesterday I think. And Stuart, thank you for being so incredibly patient and amazing with her. For a change, I not only got clothes for Mia, I actually got some pants for myself! Then we did the Jamba Juice thing, and they made Mia her own mini smoothie cup and she sat at the table with us, lifting her glass and saying ""CHEERS!"" while we clinked cups, just like her father showed her last time we had Jamba Juice. That kid is developing one hell of a memory.  Just remembered... I've also been watching Last Comic Standing for a while, and I had a dream last night that I had to do a routine on stage. I could probably do it, but in the dream I didn't have enough prep time so I chickened out. Strange.  Well, the ""boss"" calls.. time to make a waffle and get myself ready for a Starbucks trip & the Sunday Times puzzle. I may see Wendi & Jake later, we'll see.   "
13033,1197086,"06,August,2004",2004-08-06,"    Today I finally finished up building this wretched thing.  Last night I glued in what at the time was a perfect windshield.  After holding it down to let the glue setup, however, I noticed that I got two little spots of glue that ran down from the chrome frame that the windshield sets in; I can't keep anything nice!  In case you were wondering, in this photo the model is setting on the trunk of my fathers '57 (see photo in the last post.)  The color is called Tropical Turquoise."
13034,1197086,"05,August,2004",2004-08-05,"    This is my father's 1957 Chevrolet Bel Air Two-door Sports Coupe. Under the hood is a three-year-old 350 cu. in. Chevy crate motor, pushing out 250 horsepower. Setting on top of the motor is a Holley 650 carburetor bolted to a Edelbrock intake. Bolted to the back of the motor is a Muncie 3 speed manual transmission, and the rear end is the only original thing on the car. For more information about my dad's car, I have setup a  urlLink website  where I can post photos from trips that we take in the car.  In about 10 or 12 hours I will more than likely be in the garage waxing the front of the car so that bugs won't bake into the paint job on the hood when we go to Idaho. We will be driving this car over 2,000 miles to Coeur d'Alene, Idaho for the 2004  urlLink Bowtie/ Late Great Chevy  International convention without air conditioning, what fun! Yep, that right, no air conditioning because the motor runs ""too hot"" as it is, and adding air conditioning would probably fry the thing. Get this- while driving 5 MPH in a parade our car temperature gage is halfway between C &amp; H, however, when driving 80 MPH down the interstate in third gear the gage is leaning on H and you can smell anti-freeze. My mechanic father and I believe that the shaft in the water pump (which the fan blade is bolted to) is slipping at higher RPMs, thus pumping less anti-freeze/ water through the motor. At lower RPMs, however, the slippage is less, thus causing virtually no change in water temperature."
13035,1197086,"05,August,2004",2004-08-05,"    Today, or actually yesterday, I finished a devil model car I was building.  The model is a 1953 Chevrolet Corvette Panamericana racecar, however, it ended up being a 1953 Chevy Corvette with engine parts from a 1954 Chevy Corvette because I didn't read the instructions.  OriginallyI planned to make it a model that looked like it just rolled off the line, but after screwing up the paint job in two spots on the driver's side, and numerous other mess ups, it became the ""Mexico Badger"" Panamericana racer.  I have to admit that with all the race stickers on, it does look cooler, and thanks to a couple stickers on the drivers side, I have a perfect paint job.  I plan to enter this model in a contest in Idaho next week, so I will have photos of it in competition.  If you've made it this far in the reading you are probably interested in the model cars, so here's the urlLink  link  to the kit that I built in three weeks.   "
13036,1197086,"05,August,2004",2004-08-05,"    In case you were wondering what the hell  urlLink Internet Explorer  is, it is the computer program that you use to look at web sites on a PC. Well recently my one-year-old 2.0 GHz HP computer decided to start freezing up every time I used Internet Explorer. The thing that pissed me off was that it decided to keep freezing up while I was working on a website for my fathers classic car club ( urlLink Crown City Cruisers ), so I virtually got nothing done after working for almost two hours. Finally I remembered hearing on  urlLink G4TechTV  about an  urlLink Internet Explorer  alternative called  urlLink Mozilla Firefox . After about 10 minutes of downloading, I started up Firefox, and I haven't used Internet Explorer since.  I soon found after downloading Mozilla Firefox that you can download thousands of different extensions, which are basically little programs that customize Firefox to your preference. Browser customization is probably the feature that I love the most about Firefox- something that the communist Microsoft Corporation hates.  Mozilla Firefox is what computer geeks call Open Source, which (as Dictionary.com puts it) is a method and philosophy for software licensing and distribution designed to encourage use and improvement of software written by volunteers by ensuring that anyone can copy the source code and modify it freely. This means that if I wanted to, I could write an extension for Firefox, possibly improve the software for some users, and share it freely. Open Source is the future of computer software, and will probably one day take down large corporations like Microsoft.  If you are interested in Mozilla Firefox, or any other Mozilla products check out  urlLink http://www.mozilla.org  for more information.   "
13037,1197086,"05,August,2004",2004-08-05,"    Well since my ""Official Website"" was basically a failure, I have decided to just create a blog and set it up so it is my website.  THX 138- What is it?  It is the California license plate number on John Milner's piss yellow 1932 Ford Coupe (Deuce Coupe) in the 1973 George Lucas classic American Graffiti.  The reason that this is the name of my blog is because I am interested in cars,  urlLink American Graffiti  is one of the best movies ever made, and I couldn't think of anything better.   "

13649,1223044,"10,May,2004",2004-05-10,"   The abuse of Iraqi prisoners in Iraq is disgusting, abhorant and near vomit inducing. American and British soldiers, albeit a minority of them have behaved terribly and individually they should be punished, but at the very top heads must role for these despicable war crimes.  The Red Cross has reported severe concerns of breeches in POW conditions as stated under the Geneva convention, and yes all ye idiots, America has signed up to the Geneva convention. In the British segment Red Cross advice was acted upon, the fact that the abuse ever took place is appaling by itself, but in the American segments abuse continued.  The Arab world will use this again against the west and in particular America, a major figure must go to show that these acts of abuse are simply not tolerated, for the good of all of us. RUMSFIELD MUST RESIGN.  "
13650,1223044,"04,May,2004",2004-05-04,"   Exam stress, a stubborn attitude and a slight arrogance on my part have made the last week difficult to say the least. I have been, in the words of one of my 'friends' (you'll see why I use inverted commas later) a jumped up backstabbing dick. I think this email, sent to me after a pathetic dispute over... well the email explains all:   Dear Richard   You may be correct, it may be us that owe you an apology, and i am sure that we were all prepared to talk about this like sensible adults. However, you may think that you are being mature by sending around an email telling us that we are pathetic, but for once could you maybe take a step back from your seemingly bottomless pit of knowledge, and the attitude that you always know best, and think to yourself ""Maybe i am the pathetic one?""   For example how did this whole situation spawn, well i can tell you quite easily, it began when we very kindly invited you to come on our holiday with us in the forthcoming summer, what a nice gesture. Obviously not. Somehow you managed to fabricate the idea in your own mind that we didn't want you there, which we obviously didn't considering that we invited you! You then went on to moan about the cost, location, and company which would also rather piss you off somewhat if anyone else had gone about acting in the same 'pathetic' manner. When asked if you would be attending the trip by myself and Richard you went on to kick a chair, slam a door and then go and tell Adam and Simon that they wern't invited. Very mature. I feel that what you did to them was the biggest backstabbing action which you could have taken, very noble considering that you were supposedly good friends with all of the people on the trip. As you can tell this pissed all of us off just that little bit more, but still i was prepared to hear your side of the story so i came and found you in your history room where YOU found it interesting to bombard Amy and myself with abuse, yet again another honorable action.   Then i attended Science today happy in the knowledge that i would see my good friends Richard and Polly. However, as you may know the mood turned rather sour when you found my very funny joke somewhat unfunny and went about hitting me in the face.(Which i must add was a pathetic punch)   I feel that the trouble with you Richard is that you are somewhat insecure about yourself, your exact words were ""I'm not really bothered by what you are saying, it means nothing to me"" if you not bloody bothered then why hit me in the face you idiot if your not bothered then why get in such a shit about everything, why do you make everything worse for yourself squaring up to my best friend storming off in a rage, we are not trying to upset you, it is called a joke if you wern't so pathetic and took it all with a pinch of salt people wouldn't know that it got to you, so wouldn't drill the same old insult, personally your poncy little spack today just made the joke twice as funny, as did it for everybody else in the square after you walked off, hopeing to leave in some sort of dramatic fashion when actually all you did was make yourself look like a complete twat. You wonder why people call you boring, or moody it seems inconceivable to me that you can't see why, this time last week i still thought that you were a genuine decent bloke but you just went and made yourself look like a complete idiot by trying to make somesort of noble stand, resulting, as per usual in everybody else laughing behind your back.   Richard C was right from the very beginning when he told me that you could be a jumped up backstabbing dick, i gave you the benefit of the doubt, but you had to go and shove a number of friendships right up your own ass. Pathetic.   Written by Nik   agreed by Richard    The joke he is refering to by the way, is writing nazi on a photograph of me and drawing a swastika.  I do have to admit he has exagerated these facts ever so slightly, yet it remains me who is the one who needs to apoligise. Considering my actions of the past few days, weeks even, I can see and I do realise that I have behaved in a manner that isn't appropriate, isn't friendly and a manner I simply should not have behaved in. I have apoligised to these people, but I doubt my apoligies will mean much.   I need to consider to myself, what do I want to get from this life? Happiness of course, and if this is what I want, why I am going about it like this, clearly the wrong way. Why am i ruining friendships that took an age to build, with people I actually do get on with, despite thier frequent need for racist comments. I have decided the best strategy by far is too keep my head down until way after exams now, but I'm not sure they'll have the same idea. It seems to me that I have taken a feeling of self belief too far and stepped in the realm of feeling some kind or arrogant self importance.  Things need to change, and they need to change now, I can only hope that I can change myself before I lose even more friends.  "
13651,1223044,"22,June,2004",2004-06-22,"   Perhaps a slight exageration, but tomorrow is my last GCSE exam! This momentus event in my life so far will be a 2 hour history exam on the subject of Germany between the wars, now you don't get any more exciting than that.  So this is the end of my secondery education, the end of an era you might say. After this point I shall be moving on into the world, tomorrow marks a conerstone in my life.  Okay, so now I've written a lot of waffling nonsense about that lets see whats been going on today. Um, not a lot, football tonight has been funny, final games of group C in Euro 2004. Italy played Bulgaria and Sweden played Denmark. Before the game it was widely publicised that both Sweden and Denmark would progress to the next round if thier game ended in a score draw of higher than 2 - 2. This was of course followed by the famous Azzuri excuse machine going into overdrive, ""it will be a conspiracy"" they shouted, ""we worry they might fix it"" vieri was quoted as saying. So guess what the final score was? Yep 2 - 2, never have I laughed so hard at a football result. So Sweden top the group, Denmark come second and Italy and Bulgaria are going out. This match certainly wasn't a stitch-up, but it is a very, very funny result. If Jonsson hadn't scored that late equaliser for Sweden, Italy would have been spared.  Alas, tomorrow night is a much more important game for myself, it awaits to be seen whether Germany can actaully become good at football suddenly to beat the Chezch Republic. I shall be out celebrating the end of exams with my phone constantly buzzing with score updates.  Which brings me on to the proposed events of tomorrow night. A piss up in a field. Yes, thats right, we shall be going out and doing the most stereotypical of teenage taboos, we shall be going to a field in the evening with some beers and some cider and getting sloshed. Oh the joys.  For now, I must flee, for there is much last minute, panic revision to be done.  "
13652,1223044,"19,June,2004",2004-06-19,"   urlLink Germany 0 latvia 0 , not a great game at all.   As promised I shall explain my reasons for my disent towards Ukip. Ukip are a party controlled by a idiot, spun by an American and whose lead candidate in the European elections is a bigoted racist with a permanent sun tan.      To move on from the childish reasons, the Independent on June 16th put it nicely, describing just what leaving the EU means, it  urlLink truly is a Â£23Bn question . Not only is it sheer lunancy to leave the EU, the largest free trade area in the world and the greatest single benifit to UK interests, the alternatives proposed by Ukip are terrifying to say the least.  They want Britain to leave the European Union, but they are in favour of economic globalisation, and a stronger role for the US dominated World Trade organisation (WTO). The WTO which is already forcing genetically modified US goods into British supermarkets; the WTO that puts global free trade before environmental regulation; the WTO that undermines national laws to push its own economic rules on nation states. While Ukip say they are concerned about independence from Brussels paradoxically they are perfectly prepared to surrender our sovereignty to the WTO and the US.  Similarly Ukip dangle before the electorate the enticing possibility of joining the North American Free Trade Association (NAFTA) to replace the EU, cementing Britainâ€™s place as the 51st state of America. Unfortunately however this would allow American companies to be free to sue British companies for loss of profits if they tried to impose health and safety or environmental laws that according to NAFTAâ€™s frankly bizarre definition of free trade discriminates against these companies.  Rather more worryingly, Ukip have almost identical policies to the BNP on migration and asylum; many UKIP parliamentary candidates have been former National Front or Northern League of New Britain Party activists, hence UKIP have been dubbed ""the BNP with smiling faces.â€ I only have to point your attention to Robert Kilroy-Silk, who made horrifically stereotypical comments about Arabs describing them all as â€œsuicide bombers, limb amputators and women repressors.â€  Ukip is an unrealistic political party composed almost entirely of white middle-aged men who seem determined to try and return Britain to an imagined 1950s golden age. It's not going to happen, Britain is stong when in Europe, strong when at the heart of Europe, strong when she can speak alongside her European allies to provide a counter-balance to the lunatic US foreign policy of late.  Recently after Ukip's supposed election breakthrough (15% of the votes from an uninformed and uninterested electorate), they have vowed to 'wreck' the European parliament, so they don't just want to 'wreck' the UK by withdrawing it, they want to ruin the institution that is bringing economic, social and political benifits to the rest of the EU. Selfish? Go and play your mindless political games elseware Mr Kilroy-Silk and let the people of the EU enjoy the peace and prosperity that a stable and united Europe has brought to us.  "
13653,1223044,"19,June,2004",2004-06-19,"   Exams are all but over now (I have food technology and History left but they really arn't important), so the long summer has all but begun. This can only mean one thing, time for a lot of drunken parties, lounging around doing nothing in particular and eventually and very reluctently accpeting that I shall have to get a job once I begin to run out of money.  As I write this its half time in the Germany vs. Latvia match in Euro 2004, I expect I'm one of very few people in England cheering on Germany, often in a match like this the whole nation become honourary supporters of the opposition. The English have always disliked the Germans and as far as I can see always will, no doubt there are very deep physchological reasons for this none of which I can be bothered to venture into now.  Throughout the country theres a lot of rather messy upheaval regarding Europe and Britains place in the EU, something I feel quite strongly about as a person who considers himself to be 'European' rather than 'British' (this is because one of my grandparents is Irish the other German) and I feel particuarly strong ties to both these countries. I'm personally disgusted by the gains of the far right UK independence party at the European parliament elections last week for reasons I shall venture into after the second half of the football.  Caio for now.  "
21673,1225881,"09,April,2004",2004-04-09,"   So I have decided to spruce up the old blog (Laura and Savannah have finally bugged me into doing it...)  I'm going to try to update, but I'm not making any promises.  What's new with the Brantino you ask?  Well, nothing much; here's the quick and dirty:  Still no solid prom date and anxiously awaiting to hear from GSP so I will know if I will be losing five weeks of summer.  I have to get reading glasses in order to prevent my eyes from getting to the point where I really need glasses.  I got flipped off while driving...for cutting off another car. OOPS!  My sister claims to have a running freshman poll (I'm thinking about 2 people) that if I grew my hair out long, I would become a ""hottie.""  Hmmmmm...  If I ever do change my hair style, it won't be because of a freshman poll.  5 weeks of school left...Summer plans anyone...???   "
21674,1225881,"12,April,2004",2004-04-12,"   I just spent almost 2 hours reading the 9/11 timeline mentioned today in Leander Kahney's blog.   It's really scary  to think that so many people, including high ranking government officials, could have had knowledge of the attacks before they happened.  I leave tomorrow for Louisville and will not return until Thursday.  I started to work on my homework, but, of course, got sidetracked.  That leaves me with two chapters to read in my AP book and a  TON  of review problems for math.  Fun.   "
21675,1225881,"11,April,2004",2004-04-11,"   I had to get up REAL early today.  I went to Easter sunrise service at Mount Pisgah and had to get up at 4:30.   Yuck.   Lot of people from our church came as well as Lindsey and crew.  When I got home I sat down on the couch at about 10 and ended up falling asleep and sleeping until 2.  I really didn't mean to do that!  This afternoon Greg, Torrie, Joe Paul and Katie came over to hunt Easter eggs and Greg, Torrie, Mom and I ended up doing to Francis BBQ where my arranged prom date works.  I was afraid the situation would be a little awkward, but it really wasn't that bad.  Mary (The arranged prom date) was  REALLY  funny and I think we will have a good time.  Should I call her and ask her if she wants to do something between now and then?  I think I might try, but she works a lot.  Ah, decisions, decisions...   "
21676,1225881,"30,April,2004",2004-04-30,"   I have come to the conclusion that I am uncool.  No after prom plans, no life, no after prom plans, my tux is all messed up and errrr....I don't know what to do after prom is over.  Plus, I haven't been posting.  How uncool.  I applied for FBLA Reporter because I probably won't get to go to camp...and somehow I got VP of Competitive Events.  I'm happy, I don't really care what office I get, I just hope no body gets mad.  Prom is gonna look pretty cool.  I hope it rocks.  I also I hope I don't get slapped in the face with a steak at Showgun.  I never eaten there before, but I have heard that they throw food.  Maybe not the best place to eat before prom?  I should sleep....kinda got a big day tomorrow.  Pray that I make it though the day....and that my date won't want to kill me.  I might just croak from all this prom crappage anyway…  tino   "
21677,1225881,"12,May,2004",2004-05-12,"   I'm mad at my car.  I've been nothing but good to it, I even washed it yesterday, and what does it do?  Freakin short circuits.  I can still drive it, my power lock on the driver side door just went out.  This may seem small, but it keeps blowing the fuse, which also has something to do with what locks the gearshift.  So now every time I break my gearshift clicks telling me it's ready to change gears, at 50 MPH.  Lets not think of the cost of replacing the little motor inside the door.  Gillie Hyde doesn't even sell wiper blade for under $100.  (If I paid that much for wiper blades they had better be gold plated or something.)  The other day I found out I didn't get Senior Engineer, which isn't a big deal at all.  It's just that a few of the people that go it don't seem like they would be good team leaders or are overall insane.  I'm working on a diabolical plan to sabotage it all next year...can we say wireless access point on the same frequency as their wireless network hidden in my backpack? (They'll never find it! MAH HA HA!)  In all seriousness, I wish everybody next year great success and hope everything goes well.   "
21678,1225881,"11,May,2004",2004-05-11,"   One week left... then graduation... then GSP... Wow everything is flying by.  I thought it was after your senior year that everything was supposed to change, but it seems like everything is changing now.  My dad quit his job, his last day is Friday.  I'm happy for him that he will be able to take some time off an do what he wants to, farm, ect.  It just feels weird because my dad has worked at the same bank since before I can remember and I can't fathom the idea that he won't be working there anymore.  I guess I'll get used to it...  Graduation will be hard this year because I know so many of the seniors.  At the same time it will be a reminder that we only have one year left.  It doesn't seem like it was that long ago that we were Freshmen.  I guess I'll get used to it all...   "
21679,1225881,"17,May,2004",2004-05-17,   It's late and I can't talk much.  Tommorrow is the last day of school as well as Graduation.  (Good and bad)  I leave you with this random thought:

I'm probably not even taking the final in any of my other classes.  I'm bad, I know.  I can't wait for summer is all I have to say.   "
2038,1232458,"06,August,2004",2004-08-06,    Hey kimmer let me know if you get this so i know how to give comments. dad has a lot of info on greece for you. did you know the apostle paul attended the first olympics   
2039,1232458,"02,August,2004",2004-08-02,"    Our first ""unofficial"" unit study will be on the 2004 Summer Olympic Games.  We will be studying every subject in regards to the olympics, Greece, gymnastics etc..  We have about two dozen books from the library on such subjects as the summer games, the Parthenon, Mary Lou Retton (winner of the gold in the 1984 summer games), Bruce Jenner (decathalon winner), Greek Mythology, Marion Jones, Olympic history.  We will also be looking at the significance of the Torch, Olga Korbut (medal winner of the 1972 summer games), Nadia Comaneci (7 perfect 10's and medal winner of the 1976 summer games), we will be listening to Nadia's song, we will explore greek food and desserts and study the globe.  While researching all of these subjects in our books we will incorporate spelling, vocabulary, math, science, history and crafts into the study.  We have made some really fun crafts to decorate around the t.v.  We made two olympic torches to go on top of the television, we have American flags hanging on the wall, we made the Olympic rings out  of colored pipe cleaners and we are hanging olympic articles on the wall.  We took the girls and two of their friends to a Greek cafe for lunch on Saturday and we made them eat Greek food (ok, so it was only a grilled cheese pita),  Michael and I were a little braver, we tried gyros.  While we were waiting for our food the girls all worked on an olympic word search puzzle that I made out of  grid paper.  There is a restaurant close by called ""The Partenon"" so we will take our Parthenon book with us when we go to eat another Greek meal.  I told all the girls on Saturday while we were all having a blast that this is homeschool.  We had our Tivo unit shipped to us so that we could record all the events and pause and rewind whenever we wanted to discuss something or see it again.  We are going to eat Greek desserts while we watch the games.  This is basically an introduction to the girls on what homeschooling is going to be like, and how our lives have changed.  We are having a blast.   "
2040,1232458,"01,August,2004",2004-08-01,"    I am also expecting that God will be my guide. I have always prayed that if we were supposed to homeschool that God first would give me the desire and then the ability. Well, here we are. He has definitely given me the desire and a million creative ideas and I now expect that He will give me the ability to do this. When we left Florida I asked God to change me. If I had to go through this painful and emotional move then I wanted to be changed for His glory. One of the things that I have always despised within myself was the lack of discipline and diligence in my life. My heart's desire is to be stronger in both those areas. Guess what? He is changing me . The only way I will be able to successfully homeschool my daughters is to exercise more discipline (being in the Word and prayer on a more consistent basis) and diligence (sticking to what I have chosen to do). I'm sure that I will still ""fly by the seat of my pants"" just as I always have, but that will be the exception and not the rule to my life. I don't plan on giving up my spontaneity or spirit of fun, it will now be incorporated into our homeschool life. I can't wait to just up and announce to the girls that we are doing school in our pajamas, or guess what, we are going to do school at the pool, or who wants to blow off school today and go shopping, etc.....Please pray for me that God would direct my paths and give me discernment.   "
2041,1232458,"01,August,2004",2004-08-01,"    My plan for Hannah is similar to Sarah's only in the math curriculum. Hannah will be using hands on manipulatives called ""fraction layovers"" and will also share the blocks with her sister. This program is designed to teach the child more critical thinking, and to give them a clear understanding of the math that they are learning and now to use it and apply it in life. I am sure she will do great. Now her other curriculum is called ""Total Language Plus"". This is based on the reading of a lot of literature and similarly to the math curriculum, will teach her critical thinking, make her think outside the box and come up with her own answers and ideas. Hannah's spelling, grammar, and vocabulary will also come from this language program (plus). Once again we will be doing a lot of unit studies to incorporate every area of their education. We as a family are looking forward to a lot of field trips in our RV for these unit studies (Washington D.C., Mt. Rushmore, Grand Canyon, Williamsburg, Underground RailRoad, etc.) I think Hannah is going to group spiritually and intellectually over the next year.   "
2042,1232458,"01,August,2004",2004-08-01,"    My plan for Sarah is to really concentrate on her comprehension of phonics. I am starting her on a program called ""Explode the Code"". This should give her a firm foundation to build her reading skills on, hopefully boost her confidence so that she will fall in love with reading. It has been suggested that I don't force her to read books right now, just concentrate on the Code and give her a chance to develop her reading skills. I was told that this is basically called ""delayed academics"" and if we give our children a little time to get ready naturally then they will soar as soon as it clicks....kind of like potty training a toddler....you can't force them until they are ready. I also ordered her a math curriculum with manipulative blocks to teach her to understand the math that she is learning....not just memorize it. It looks fun. Those are my main two focus points for Sarah for at least the next four or five months. Then of course I will be using unit studies on all kinds of fun topics to incorporate the spelling, history, science, crafts etc....   "
26416,1254400,"29,May,2004",2004-05-29,"   Abe and I have long bemoaned the fact that churches (and Christians in general) tend to worship the Money God over the True God.  In churches we have both worked for in the past, it was common for the first question about any activity to be ""how much does it cost?"" rather than ""is this what God wants us to do?""    I wonder why we Christians can't get it through our thick heads that money just really doesn't matter?  We should just be focused upon pleasing God and accomplishing His will.  He will handle the details.  Makes me mad.  "

And me? My Eshare's all fucked up so I can't answer emails.  &nbsp;  I want to text you and ask for the link where you can write what-have-you's but I guess you're sleeping so i thought otherwise.  &nbsp;  I'm watching Possession, the movie i love because I can actually relate to it.  &nbsp;  I love what&nbsp;Dodo did for me yesterday, Saturday. I was chatting with him at the start of my shift. I mentioned that I was the only rep here. Next thing i knew, he went offline and he showed up at the office.  &nbsp;  He brought some pandesal, peanut butter and chicken spread, and grapejuice (which he personally prepared..di masyado matamis, pero ok lang!). How sweet!  &nbsp;  I've always imagined someone doing that for me while on my weekend shift. Really nice of him.  &nbsp;  He kept me company til&nbsp;5am. He left coz he had to pick her sister up at the bus station.  &nbsp;  I think I'm genuinely starting to like him. &nbsp;I didn't know there was a sweet side to him. If only I get to see more of that...a bit of consistency.  &nbsp;  Haaay...i was grinning stupidly while I was on my way home.&nbsp;I kinda missed the feeling. I am, as what I've been ranting about for a couple of weeks now, succumbing to what my vulnerable side has been telling me....that I am getting tired of being alone.  &nbsp;  To have someone I can share my day with. Perhaps travel to places ive never been to.. discover things together...hohum..I'm starting to need somone to care for me.  &nbsp;  Whatever.....

Yep, I'm in a different shift and it's like I'm detaching myself from you guys. I see you all scrambling at the start of your shift while I'm already on my way home. It's nice because at least I get to miss all of you.   Wow, you've started going to the gym. That's good. I wanted to tag along but i thought otherwise. Pagkatapos nyan, beach na tayo.   And about the guys who've been clamoring to get to know you...good for you, bes. But I do know that you'll make the right decision coz we both know that we deserve the best. And I'm glad you're starting to like a certain someone although you haven't told me much about him, I'll respect that and prolly wait for the time when you'll finally tell me.    What's up with me?    Well, I've been battling some financial issues at home. Katrina's been bugging me to let her ride on my credit card. I told her that I'm actually thinking of shelling out some moolah for Paolo's tuition fee that's due at the end of this month but she wouldn't hear it. She actually texted some of our tita's asking if she will be allowed to ride on their credit cards! Que horror!  Guess i learned something new about my sister (oh, wait! Macoy approached me to ask a question. I had to stop typing so I could cover my nose. ok, where was i)  . She will get the thing she wants one way or the other.  Hohum...sometimes I spend hours getting ready for work because I would always end up staring at the wall for almost half an hour just trying to figure out what i'll do with my life and my family. I'm afraid i'll end up following kaje and get a job in Dubai just so i can give enough for my family.  I'm scared because I might lose myself in the process. I'm afraid I won't be able to fulfill my dreams because of all these shit. I try to be selfish at times but everytime I go home and I see the empty cupboards, I am reminded of my neverending responsibilities.  I just wish I could get away for a couple of days and just enjoy myself.  I miss the old times we had. I miss the simple life we had but of course, with Ada entering the picture, one could never complain.    O well, life's a bitch. I guess I just hafta wait for my turn to wither and die.     love you bes! Always take care! Get enuf sleep if u can, hah. mwah   "

Yes .. the badminton incident was like a dose of cold water ... I guess that's the thing about having a child ... when all your friends are single and able .. I got hurt ... well that's that ... I realized a lot after that ...       I guess that's why I choose not to attend parties anymore... or wait for an invitation to be extended anymore.. one rejection is enough ...       I love my 8pm to 5am shift .. I'm starting my post natal exercise program .. and hopefully it will be fruitful... did I mention that I was gonna be attending a wedding and I was a part of the entourage? well ... yes I am .. always a bridesmaid never a bride... hohum ...       I get messages from all over asking me for my number and other stuff .. thru friendster .. but I'm not really wasting my time over it... I don't get thrilled like I used to. I guess I've truly matured... I don't know bes I want someone I'm comfortable with ..       I think I'm liking someone ... but I'll keep it to myself for now .. I wanna straighten things out with Reker first ...       You'll be in that shift for the whole month ... I was thinking ... why don't we check into a hotel and I don't know .. brood??? we'll plan it ...       this will be for now..    Chin

I miss just being with you and that doesn't include the talks. You're one rare gem. I can be myself when I'm with you. I can be grouchy, I can talk about nonsensical stuff as well as really really profound ones and you'll counter it with your own views. I miss that about you.  The 'badminton' incident was really awkward. My mind was out of sorts and to tell you the truth it did cross my mind to ask you but I thought otherwise. I guess I underestimated you. I do apologize for that. It's just that there are times when I really have to shake and remind myself that you're with us again.  I guess I got so used to not seeing you around when you were carrying Ada in yer tummy. I have yet to snap out of it. You're already here with us. And you're ready to start a new life with Ada. Sorry if I could be selfish like that sometimes.  Maybe it's the price I have to pay for being friends with a lot of people. I really have to struggle to get out of their circle just so i could spend some time alone. That's also the reason why I chose to work on a diff shift for the remainder of August. I want to sort my life out and spend time with people I really want to spend time with. And with no questions asked: you are no.1 on that list.  I miss you bes. Wish we can go out some time and be autistic.  Love you!   "

So I don`t even have to say that i`m not attracted to loud women who talk to much or for that matter anyone who talks to much and never has anything to say of substance.  When I say that I`m a real LAID BACK type of person; that just means that it does not take much to keep me entertained and i rarely get stressed out. Everythang is everythang. I wonder if you can keep me entertained --mentally? Hope so.  As far as being STRONG WILLED, when i see something that I want and I have set my mind on obtaining it I will not give up until its mine. So that takes alot of self-confidence. Not bad for a shy person. So please believe me when i say that just because i am shy does not mean i am a push over; i never let people walk over me....That wouldn`t match my character at all...because i like to be in control of any and all situations i find myself involved.

People who take the time to get to know me will find out i`m real easy to get along with. Even though im a serious person i make alot of jokes to keep the people around me smiling.  In my opinion i`m DEEP. Or better put self-conscious. If there is something about me that can be improved upon and you have that knowledge...By all means speak it..b/c I will listen. I`m a firm believer in change. Anything that continues to stand still is not making progress. You may think otherwise but I suppose the only way to find out is to try and get to know me. To find out why I hold certain opinions about life, love, religion and the human soul, poetry, and utimately the artistic poetry in loving life through God (or gods-whatever you believe; i do not judge) and your own soul. To me the meaning of life is coming to the realization that you are alive and that is profound in itself.

So here it is, the first BLOGG!!! (woohoo!) Canada Day 2004 will without a doubt go down in my books as a memorable one.  Actually, the festivities started a little early this year thinking I'd take July 1st as a day off to recouperate before coming in (reluctantly) for work the next day....Uhmmmm didn't happen :P  Here's what did...  June 30: PreCanada Day BBQ Great food, Great Drinks, Great Music, Great friends!!!  And all set to a Hawaiian/Beach-type theme. Thanks to Karlo, Gerard, Laura, Don, Jen, & Rodney for coming out.  July 1st: Canada Day  Don, Jen & Rodney stayed over.  I Woke up with a mild headache (didn't drink as much as I would have liked to) but nothing that a good cup of java and a hearty filipino breakfast couldn't fix.  Jen was the first up, Don passed out (way too much to drink) and Rodney just was tired out.    Fast forwarding to some night action.... Darlene & Marcella (long time highschool gal pals) came over for some pre-drinking before we'd head down to Seven (on Adelaide and University) to meet up with Diana (another highschool bud).  On the way to, we picked up Nadine, yes another Ex-Poper like the other 3.  Needless to say, the night was truly memorable.  Pre-drinking consisted of a Sambucca shot (notice the absence of ""shots"", eww), Cran and Raspberry Vodka chasers, Tequila and Lemon Drop shots.  We had a nice buzz going.  Just when we thought the night couldn't get any more exciting.... my dog Tamiko managed to slip passed us through the door and bolted with the sound of the fireworks.  It took us a long and scary while for find her (shaking).  Who knew that Marcella (the sprinter), Darlene (the pick-up) and Me (the negotiator) could manage to pull this off in a semi-drunken state.  Well after this fiasco, we kinda lost our buzz (darnit all).  My sister was gracious enough to drive us downtown after what happened and we arrived at Seven just as the club was starting to get busy.  The rest of the night seems like a blur, and I'm still trying to piece most of it together....  Like I said earlier, this one is definitely ""ONE FOR THE BOOKS""!!!  "
21087,1916038,"29,July,2004",2004-07-29,"   â€œMummy, Daddy, wake up! Weâ€™re going to the beach today, remember?!â€ Jonah shook his parents by their shoulders. Daddy stirred from his sleep and leaned over to the side table to reach for the clock.  â€œJonah, itâ€™s only 5.30 a.m, son. Itâ€™s too early,â€ Daddy replied groggily.  â€œBut Daddy, I want to see the sunrise,â€ Jonah whined. He continued to shake his Mummy.  â€œJonah? Whatâ€™s wrong darling?â€ Mummy asked him sleepily with one eye opened.  â€œI want to go to the beach now Mummy. I want to catch the sunrise.â€ Jonah urged Mummy to wake up.  â€œOh, alright then. Wait downstairs and let Mummy and Daddy change before we stroll through the beach,â€ Mummy replied as she pushed Daddy off the bed and signaled him to bathe. Jonah excitedly got off the bed and ran downstairs.   He had always loved the sunrise and today he had wanted to catch the sun rising across the waters. Though the drive from his house to the beach was short, he still wanted them to arrive slightly earlier. He waited as patiently as he could and got out the cereal box to eat his breakfast calmly. Just as he was about to finish, he heard his parents coming down the stairs. Like a bolt of lightning, he went to his parents and pulled them to the front door.  â€œLetâ€™s go Mummy, Daddy.â€ He urged them.  â€œJonah, we havenâ€™t even have our breakfast,â€ Mummy scolded him gently.  â€œNevermind Julia. Weâ€™ll have our breakfast later,â€ Daddy replied laughingly. So the trio went out of the door and went to their driveway. It was still dark but Jonah was used to the darkness â€“ so were his parents. Jonah climbed on the seat quickly and rushed his parents to move faster. Seconds later, they were driving through the lane which led to the beach.   When they reached, Jonah left his parentsâ€™ side and straightaway climbed on a large rock facing the sea. He huddled himself together and felt the morning breeze blowing gently across his face. He checked his watch and realized that after all the commotion, it was only 5.45am. He turned his head when Daddy called him.  â€œJonah, your mum and I will be getting our breakfast. You wait here alright? Weâ€™ll get you your breakfast too.â€ Nodding his head, he turned back to watch the sea. He was used to being left alone on the beach to catch sunrise while his parents went away. They had taught him to be independent though he was only eleven. He smelled the crisp air of Oklahoma and felt free. He loved the beach so much that his parents actually bought the house so that he could frequent the beach.   When a tinge of orange crept into the darkness, Jonah kept his eyes on it. Slowly, as if playing hide-and-seek, the glowing sun peeped from behind the sea. The warmth of the sun spread through the beach and pierced through the cold morning breeze, engulfing Jonah with its warmth. Jonah breathed in a fresh of fresh air and pampered himself with the feeling of being engulfed. He saw a few other people strolling together, mostly couples, hand in hand. Laying his head on his arm, he waited for his parents to come with his breakfast and they will be able to stroll the beach together.  But they never came back. Jonah waited and waited but there was no sign of them. It was his uncle who came to pick him up.  â€œJonah? Come here, son,â€ his uncleâ€™s voice rang out and he felt two hands taking his shoulder. He was then embraced by his uncle. He was puzzled as to why his uncle came instead of his parents and why there were tears in his uncleâ€™s eyes. He was also bewildered as to why his uncle was hugging him tightly. What happened?   Jonah still remembered how curious he felt to see his relatives crying. Never have he seen his uncles cry though he had seen his aunties cry. His uncle Johnny led him into a room and he saw two beds occupied but the person on each bed were covered with blanket all the way over their heads. Jonah became puzzled as to why Uncle Johnny showed them to him. He was not afraid of ghost or anything. Was this another prank?   But when Uncle Johnny brought him closer to the beds, he felt his hair stand and his heart felt heavy.  â€œWhat is going on Uncle John?â€ Jonah asked curiously as he looked up to look at Uncle John. Uncle John only stifled a cry before lifting the covers. He felt the ground swayed when he saw his Daddy and Mummy, pale-face, lying on each bed.  â€œMummy? Daddy? Wake up. Why are you sleeping?â€ Jonah asked furiously. He refused to believe or even think that his parents wereâ€¦ not coming back.  â€œWake up! You promised to buy me breakfast remember?"" Jonah all but shouted.  â€œWake up please Mummy, Daddy. Please donâ€™t leave me all alone,â€ Jonah finally cried as he hugged his parentsâ€™ lifeless body.  â€œPlease donâ€™t leave me all alone here. I donâ€™t want to be alone.â€"
21088,1916038,"28,July,2004",2004-07-28,"   15 years had passed since his parents died but at 26 now, he could still remember the tragedy like as if it was yesterday. His parentsâ€™ were killed at a car crashed. They crashed with a drunkard who was driving in a drunken stupor. Life had been hard after that. He still remembered asking for his parents sometimes when he had nightmares at night. But it was always his Uncle John who stood by him. It was also thanks to him that he received proper education and lifestyle. He really owned that old man a lot.   Now that he was a successful shop owner,selling books, he moved out of Uncle Johnâ€™s apartment and bought one of his own. Occasionally he would visit Uncle John, like today. He needed company sometimes. He's an old bachelor.  â€œUncle John? Where are you?â€ Jonah called out when he was at the porch.  â€œJonah? Here! Backyard young man!â€ Uncle John shouted. Knowingly, Jonah went to the backyard and saw the dear old man standing under the redbud tree where mistletoes grew from. His Uncle John loves to plant plants.  ""Atleast that will keep his mind off about getting me married,"" Jonah thought to himself. Jonah hurried to Uncle John and pecked his cheek.  ""Glad that oyu could come Jonah. I was getting bored being here alone. Though there is company, just next door. A new neighbour, sexy as hell, Jonah."" Uncle john smirked. Shaking his head, Jonah sat down under the tree with Uncle John.  ""So how have you been ,Jonah?"" Uncle John asked, getting serious. Jonah could only shrug his shoulders. He couldn't tell Uncle John that he still had nightmares. He decided that it was best to keep quiet. The two kept quiet as they gaze across the lawn. Due to the weekly companion by Jonah, he was also able to help mow the lawn.   The silence was shattered by the slam of the door. It came from the new neighbour and seconds later, a figure hurried towards them.  ""John? You ok? I called your home but no one picked it up. What are .."" her words trailed off. So this is the sexy neighbour Unce John was talking about. Jonah gazed at her up and down. She was wearing long pants and long sleeve shirt but still he could&nbsp;imagine that she has got a great body underneathe.&nbsp;He was instantly attracted to her. The thought of it got him worked up. No wonder old Uncle John gets worked up easily. Poor him.  ""Dana, meet Jonah, my nephew. Jonah, meet Dana."" Uncle John introduced. Jonah only offered a quick smile before dropping his gaze. In that brief moment, he could see that her eyes were a light shade of green. Her bronze hair cascaded past her shoulders and her body was petite but it curved at the right places. In short, she was beautiful. He looked up at the mistletoes before looking down at his feet again.   The man called Jonah was what she thought as rude. Not even a handshake. But she did not take it into consideration much as she has a soft spot for the man's uncle. He's so sweet.  ""Well, since you're okay, I'd better go then. See you around John,"" Dana said before retreating back to her home.  ""What da hell was that for, Jonah? Couldn't you be more friendly?"" Uncle John repriminded him. He didn't know what was wrong with him. Normally he would have be friendly with any lady that chatted up with him or he encountered but with that lady, Dana, beautiful name, his social entiquette just fail him. That lady sure has got some sort of magnetic pull in her.  ""Damn Jonah. What if she never comes back after that encounter? I'll be bored to death when you're not here,"" Uncle John complained exaggeratedly as he got up to go back to his house, it was getting dark.  Don't worry Uncle John. I'll make sure she comes back.""  Jonah thought. Casting another look at Dana's house, he slowly trudged back into the house."

After a quick conference we decided, fuck it. Well they did. I wanted to go round the field, but OH NO. Anyway to cut a long story short. there were no cops. We got nicely pissed. then played on a dance mat.    Guess who won! thats right! it wasn't me. Matt won instead. But I reckon I won the Tekken fights (Yes Tekken 1) anyway.

29357,2278942,"22,July,2004",2004-07-22,"   In my last blog, I had had pointed out a suggestion that a firm primarily exists because of the existence of marketing costs. But then a firm could keep growing and growing eliminating all market transactions. Obviously, there have to be certain reasons why this does not happen.  1) As the firm gets larger, the cost of doing transactions within the firm will increase rather than increase, as predicted. A point will be reached where the costs of organizing an extra transaction within the organization is equal to the costs involved in doing the same transactions in the open market. It could also be that another entrepreneur would be doing the same transaction at a lower cost.  2) As the firm grows larger, the value drawn from the factors of production is not maximized. The entrepreneur may fail to make the best use of the factors of production. In other words, a point will be reached when the loss on the firm through the wastage of resources is is equal to the marketing costs of the exchange transactions in the open market or by that being done by another entrepreneur.  In effect, the firm will expand till the cost of doing any extra transaction within the firm equals the cost of doing the same thing in the open market.  An interesting exception to the other rule is the combination of two such firms. A firm should only take over another whole organization only if the latters cost of doing a transaction and the cost of doing the transaction on the open market is less than the cost of the former doing it.  Other things being equal, a firm will tend to be larger  1) if the cost of organizing a transaction is lesser and the rate of change of these costs will increase with the increase in the transactions organized. 2) if the entrepreneur is less likely to make mistakes and the rate of increase of these mistakes decreases with the transactions organized within the firm. 3) if the cost of supplying factors of production to firms of larger size does not increase at a rapid rate.  This does tend to concur with our observations that larger firms tend to be inefficient within, however are able to compensate the same by commanding lesser transaction costs in the open market (they manage to sell by sheer size, or branding, etc.) "
29358,2278942,"17,July,2004",2004-07-17,"   Most of us know that the economy exists because of the competing forces of supply and demand. But seldom have we questioned as to why it would be necessary to have organizations/firms in order to do the production? Outside of the firm, price movements direct production, which is coordinated through a series of transactions in the market. However, inside the firm, these transactions are eliminated and are instead replaced by an enterpreneur-coordinator who directs production. R.H.Coase was the first to ask such a question, and his theories became the foundation of what is called Coasian Economics. He asked: ""If production is regulated by price movements, production could be carried on without any organization at all, in which case, why is there any organization at all?""  The main reason why it would be profitable to establish a firm would be that there is a cost of using the price mechanism. Every transaction in the economy must be performed at a cost. It would be far more favourable if the transaction costs that are incurred in this manner be minimized. There could be two approaches to doing that. One, employ the services of specialists who would enter into a  contract  with the producer, thereby replacing multiple transactions by one, and the second, to employ certain factors who would agree to agree to obey the instructions of the enterpreneur within certain limits for a certain renumeration. Such a contract should only state the limits of the powers of the enterpreneur; within these limits, he can therefore direct the other factors of production.  Also, owing to the dificulty of forecasting, the longer the period of a contract for the supply of a commodity or service, the less possible and indeed desirable it is for a the purchaser to specify what the contractor can and should do. A firm is likely to emerge in those cases where a very short term contract is likely to be satisfactory. To sum it up, the operation of a market costs something and by forming an organization and allowing some authority (an ""enterpreneur"") to direct the resources, such costs can be saved. The enterpreneur has to carry our his function at less cost, taking into account the fact that he may get the factors of production at a lower price than the market cost he is trying to overcome. If not, he can always revert back to the open market if he fails to do this. The interesting thing is that without the uncertainty factor, a firm would probably not arise.  An enterpreneur may also be defined as a person who takes the residual and fluctuating income from production while the employees engaged in production take a fixed income. However this may not seem to be the reason for the formation of a firm, as the profits may be shared by the employees. "
29359,2278942,"16,July,2004",2004-07-16,"   In an attempt to broaden my horizons and my thinking, I will attempt to write articles and my opinions on topics that I find at random. The strength of an argument depends solely on data and is supported only by strong writing skills. Hopefully I will be able to present convincing data!  In the 15th Century, Christopher Columbus sailed the seas in search of sea routes to the east seeking spice. He discovered an entirely new continent in the process. That continent now houses one of the most powerful nations in the world. Today the search continues. Man is reached deep into space. Space probes have ventured into the boundaries of our solar systems. Man has already gained command over landing on the moon. He is trying to reach the next planet: Mars. Who knows what such a search may yield. It may not sound very convincing today, but it's a bet that over time will yield benefits far greater than those that can be imagined. Man should never give up pushing frontiers trying to reach planets.  What is it that separates this species of the Hominids from the other species on the planet? He thrives on challenge. It is the challenge that causes him to focus all his faculties on achieving a goal. He builds from dreams and concepts, failure to him becomes the stepping stone to success. It is his will to achieve higher and higher ambitions that given him the power to be the dominant species on earth. Even though improving conditions on earth is important, it should not be a deterrent to achieving loftier ambitions. It holds several economic, strategic and sociological implications, with far reaching outcomes.  Trying to reach other planets is symbolic of human nature to innovate. Innovation is a prime mover for various spheres of life, whether it is business, politics or society. It acts as a catalyst, transforming our very lives. Innovation can be of two types: sustaining and disruptive. Sustaining innovations such as improvements made to methodologies used to improve agricultural output have contributed significantly to our quality of life. On the other hand, it is the disruptive innovations that have the maximum impact on our society. The study of genetics, for example, holds the key to disruptively enable us to solve our food problems, giving us a totally different approach to solving the age-old problem. Totally unrelated innovations in the study of the molecular biology have led us to the brink of quadrupling agricultural output. Trying to reach the moon was a disruptive innovation, as is trying to reach Mars today. In trying to do so, it has opened innovation in several dimensions. It may not help us improve the conditions on earth immediately, but it will help us to reap unfathomable benefits. A cat in a box will never know what lies outside the box till it tries to jump out of the box. Innovation should never be stemmed. It contains the key to survivability.  Even so, the space program has yielded several direct benefits, both tangible and intangible. It provides several spin-offs to the economy. It has affected diverse areas of our general well being from the medical sciences to public safety. It has yielded several technological innovations, with little fanfare, which have affected the way we live. Temper foam, for example, used in helmets, airline seats, crash protection equipment, is an offshoot from the American Space Program. Laser Angioplasty, which saves many lives daily, owes its origins to technological breakthroughs made during the attempt to reach the moon. Communication as we know it today would not have existed had it not been for satellites, which orbit the earth: TV, mobile communications, Global Positioning Systems all owe their origin to space related technologies. Weather prediction, resource mining, all owe a lot to man's strife to surpass the boundaries of the globe. Space related technological has helped countries lead in global markets. It has several tangible benefits to the quality of life experienced by humankind. It is said that money spent on the American Space Program has yielded returns at about the same rate as expenditure on any other government expenditure. It provides employment to many. It provides the industry with a rich talent pool, something that one cannot do without.  Indeed, the drive to reach other planets is a force to reckon with. It reflects the indomitable spirit of man, his constant thirst for challenge and his ability to reap benefits from the results. Would it be wise to focus entirely on one sphere of human life (improving conditions on earth) and ignore the other? "
29360,2278942,"15,July,2004",2004-07-15,"   Why are there so many ways to say no, yet so little to say yes! The human minds it seems is more geared to critically analyze issues rather than see the light. Every argument is based on some premises and some assumptions. There are no conclusions without any assumptions... it is always possible to completely bring down an argument. However it is so dificult to actually come up with an issue and see it through. There is ALWAYS a better way, there is ALWAYS something wrong. It is indeed dificult to scavenge through the talk and come up with a winner. "

29362,2278942,"30,July,2004",2004-07-30,"   Ever wondered how to display console output in colors? If you've seen the Linux's verbose bootup sequence, you will notice the variety of colors that are used in the console output.  How the hell do you get the same in Windows based console applications? The guys are Redmond haven't left this feature out.  The Windows Platform SDK includes several functions for console manipulation. I will outline some functions that may be used to alter output to the console. The primary function to be used is  SetConsoleTextAttribute()  If you're going to use the SDK directly, this is the definition you'd be interested in:     BOOL SetConsoleTextAttribute( HANDLE hConsoleOutput, WORD wAttributes )    Unfortunately, in the managed world, no APIs are directly available. They will have to be invoked via P/Invoke. There is an posting on CodeProject by Philip Fitzsimons for this purpose. ( urlLink here )  There is one missing feature in the source he provides: Many of us customize our consoles to suit our purpose; many a times changing our console foreground and background colors. In his call to  SetForeGroundColor()  which he uses to reset the console, he just sets the foreground color of the console to Grey.  A better way would be to convert his entire class to an instance and convert all his methods into instance methods rather than static methods. In the constructor, you could use an Interop call to:     [DllImport(""kernel32.dll"")] static extern bool GetConsoleScreenBufferInfo(IntPtr hConsoleOutput, out CONSOLE_SCREEN_BUFFER_INFO lpConsoleScreenBufferInfo);     Of course, you would need to write the C# equivalent for the structure  CONSOLE_SCREEN_BUFFER_INFO . The structure contains the character attributes for the console. Store these within your instance, and just revert to the same character attributes with a call to  SetConsoleTextAttribute()  after doing your custom formatting.  There is a managed C++ sample to do the same  urlLink here   There is still nothing as good as a console program to do some tasks!  "
29363,2278942,"20,July,2004",2004-07-20,"   WordIQ defines a ""Software Engineering"" as the profession concerned with the creation and maintenance of software applications by APPLYING Computer Science, Project Management, Domain Knowledge and other skills and technologies. It is not enough to just write efficient, bug free programs to be a Software Engineer. A software engineer in the true sense should be able to unify programming knowledge (which should serve no more than as tools), with a comprehensive body of knowledge on Computer Science, Mathematics, and many other areas and apply suitable Project Management Techniques to make sure the development is effective. In some specialized areas, such as Medical Imaging, Biotechnology (which are emerging areas today), he/she needs to acquire domain knowledge, translate that into tools which can be used by already skilled people in those domains in order to help them improve their abilities and productivity.  A programmer on the other hand just needs to churn out code.  When I say that a software engineer should consider programming languages and related technologies as tools, I do not mean that one should ignore them. He/she has to know the tools that he/she needs to work with. Knowledge of the tools can help him decide which one is best suited for the job. The old adage says productivity = (skills)^tools, so tools are an extremely important aspect of developing software, something that can improve performance exponentially.  However, there needs to be note of caution. Learning a new tool takes time, and overall usage matures over time. So I do not think it very wise to jump in and learn every new tool that you come across. One should definitely not do it just for learnability's sake. If you feel you have all the tools at your disposal, please use them, instead of trying to master something new, just because its news (and somehow better, they all claim they are!)  There is indeed another caveat that software engineers fall into. Its called PROCESS. There are invariably too many ""process gurus"" within a company, each with their own very strong belief about which process is correct. A process should be tailored to the kind of development you need to have, which to some extent should depend on how fluid your development is going to be over time and what your customer expects. (If he expects, for example frequent releases, or for example is evaluating a product before purchasing is very vocal in pointing out bugs, the a continuous integration process would be quite suitable. For more control-based organizations, where there needs to be strict control on the features a product needs to have, or there is a huge separation between the analysts and developers, something like a waterfall would be more suitable. (I only provide examples, I do not want a flurry of angry emails suggesting which process is better for what!! :) ). For many companies, the process model followed by them (and as accredited by certifications) proves as a benchmark for customers as to how healthy the development within the organization is. For such companies, having these processes does make sense.  But one seldom remembers, both the above are only accessories. The customer does not care about anything other than the features the product has and how good the support is. In my opinion, one should try and stay as fluid as possible. I don't remember anybody gaining anything by having heavyweight processes in place.  The core job of a software engineer in my opinion is to bridge the gap between technology and a customer's requirement. The customer, many a times, will not know that he has a requirement! Sometimes, the software engineer will be as much a contributor to requirements as the customer himself, and that is, in my opinion, the healthy way of developing software. Sometimes a customer may think a problem unsolvable, which happens often in the image processing space, for example, but on interfacing with a software engineer, may discover infact that it is.  "
29364,2278942,"17,July,2004",2004-07-17,"   An AppDomain was a concept created in .NET to provide isolation within the context of a worker process. In the case of IIS 5, a single worker process (aspnet_wp.exe) is maintained for  all web sites , except in the case of web gardens, which may have more. In the case of IIS 6, a worker process (w3wp.exe) is maintained for an  application pool . To improve performance, web sites share this worker process, with the separation provided by a  logical process  within the process called an AppDomain.    Using .NET Remoting components from an ASP.NET application or IIS Hosted remote object    ASP.NET uses an AppDomain for each ASP.NET web site. This AppDomain contains the Application, Cache and in-process Session objects for the site. The situation is not very different for .NET remoting objects hosted on IIS. It is very easy to concieve single-call objects hosted in IIS to be new object instances in a totally different AppDomain, whereas the case is not so.  Consider the case: You have a .NET remoting object hosted in IIS which accesses another object through remoting. A common error one would make would be to register a channel on each invocation of the hosted object. This is likely to throw up a "" channel x already registered "" exception.  ChannelServices.RegisterChannel()  throws a RemotingException with the above message since a channel with the same name would have already been registered in a previous call. A channel needs to be unique by name to be registered in an AppDomain. Since only one AppDomain exists for the web site, unless recycled, you should instead check if the channel already exists prior to registering the channel with   GetChannel() .  The situation is slightly more complicated in the case of ASP.NET. If you plan to use a .NET Remote component from an ASP.NET page, you must establish the remoting configuration for the client at application start, using the  Application_Start  event in the  global.asax  file. When using  RemotingConfiguration.Configure() , you also need to very careful about the location of the configuration file. The HttpRequest will only see the virtual directory, and NOT the absolute path. However this can be circumvented using the  HttpRequest.MapPath()  method to obtain the full path to the configuration path. A similar technique can be used to setup the remoting configuration for .NET remoting objects hosted in IIS (ie via a  global.asax )  The no of AppDomains an process can contain can easily be determined by using  enumappdomains  utility.    How IIS processes requests    Process creation can be of two types: Manual and Automatic. Managed Console and Windows Forms applications comprise the former type. The latter are more tricky to deal with and consist of: 1) Managed Windows Service applications 2) Enterprise Services (COM+ including Queued Components) 3) IIS/ASP.NET We shall deal with only (3)  ASP.NET/IIS exhibits on-demand startup. They are started only when a request comes in. A request comes in through HTTP.SYS and gets queued. A control message gets sent to the WAS (W3SVC) which spins up the worker process if it is not already running. The worker process (aspnet_wp.exe or w3wp.exe) contains the appdomain for the request which fetches the request from the queue and processes it. All future requests are then routed to the AppDomain via HTTP.SYS and worker process. There is one AppDomain per application as stated earlier. Process pooling is available for ASP.NET. A process from the pool is assigned to requests in a round robin fashion and then the remains for the lifetime of the connection. Thread pooling is also available. In case of long running threads, ASP.NET kills the thread to give other request a chance. The worker process contains a thread pool of 20 by default. Once the request queue starts filling up ASP.NET starts rejecting further requests.  If a long running work item is unavoidable, it is advisable to store them in a queue and let them be processed by an application hosted in Enterprise Services or Windows Services.  How then does ASP.NET permit debugging? ASP.NET has an orphan mode where processes aren't recycled! This mode is used for debugging.  A comparison between Windows Services, Enterprise Services and ASP.NET is due... :) I shall try and cover it later.    AppDomain Recycling    Sometimes it becomes necessary to recycle an ASP.NET AppDomain without killing the worker process (it would kill the other AppDomains). Even during development, changes to shared assemblies and or other files is not uncommon. Since the CLR binds to assemblies at application start time, updates to assemblies will go unnoticed. The config files however are monitored for changes. Changes to a web application's web.config file causes the AppDomain running that application to undergo recycling. Simply ""touching"" the web.config will have the desired effect without killing the worker process. The same can be achieved by ""touching"" machine.config. However in this case, all AppDomains in the worker process will be recycled. A note of caution: you will obviously loose all Application, Cache and Session information!  "
29365,2278942,"16,July,2004",2004-07-16,"   The technology industry is becoming more like a fishmarket. Vendors offer all sorts, shapes and sizes of fish, each one claiming their own superiority over the other, haggling fiercely to get a share of the pie. Here are my observations and titbits on fish... the irony is that I am a vegetarian. No one better than an outsider to give you a different perspective! The time has come to strictly fragment the software industry into the programming and the engineering industry. Everybody claims to be an expert in their areas. I strictly believe on concentrating on the basics. Why keep going round and round in circles? Whatever I learn today will anyway become obsolete tomorrow. Instead, some basic concepts always remain the same, those are the things to concentrate on. The rest can be interpolated on at a given time. In this blog I will mostly concentrate on the things that need to be investigated from time to time and then forget over time, since something else would have replaced it. However, I may, occasionally, touch upon topics that are invariant.  "
29366,2278942,"04,August,2004",2004-08-04,"   The technique I'd like to cover today is a technique used to perform loop unrolling. Loops are often a good candidate for optimization. Do while loops, while loops, for-next loops all have a fairly similar structure: the provide a body of code to be executed within the loop, often with code that is dependent on the loop cycle (ie dependent on the variable used as the counter for the loop), and start and end conditions for the loop. Loops which are candidates for the use of Duff's device, may have a body which may or may not depend on the counter variable.  Lets take an example: How would one write code that copies one chunk of data into another? Typically, this is how it would be written:     send(to, from, count) { &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;do &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*to = *from++; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;while(--count>0); }     Let me ignore things such as bounds checking for the pointers, etc for now. (They are, however, extremely important) When the above piece of code gets translated into machine code, the body gets converted into a chunk of code, as does the condition checking and is followed by a JMP instruction. Typically, the JMP instruction, confuses the branch prediction logic in the processor, causes it to clear its instruction prefetch cache, and also, inhibit pipelining.  One very creative way of doing the same thing without the disadvantages listed above is the Duff's device:     send(to, from, count) { &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;register n=(count+7)/8; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;switch(count%8){ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;case 0:&nbsp;do{&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*to = *from++; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;case 7:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*to = *from++; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;case 6:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*to = *from++; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;case 5:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*to = *from++; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;case 4:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*to = *from++; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;case 3:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*to = *from++; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;case 2:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*to = *from++; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;case 1:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*to = *from++; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;} while(--n>0); &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;} }    This is, in my opinion, a brilliant way to achieve optimization. It does not matter which coding language you use, some people use in their Javascript, others in C, the effect of the optimization is quite aparent.  Try and understand what the code does! The value of n does not have to be the ceiling of the count by 8, it may be by 4, or any other no for that matter. However the no of cases arising would be equivalent. Also, not that each of the case statements allow the call flow to fall through, rather than break. You can put almost any logic in each of the case bodies, it does not matter. It will of course lead to a little code expansion, but the trade-off will be quite favourable.  "

25852,2510334,"15,June,2004",2004-06-15,"   It has been a couple of days, but how hot has it been?  For those of you not in England, the summer has indeed arrived. Though everybody is walking around saying â€˜nice weather, be a heat wave soonâ€™, mainly because between the last time it was this hot and now we have had all the bad weather under the sun for about 7 months.  But life must go on despite the heat, and this past few weeks I have been sitting my AS level exams Iâ€™ve had eight in total for four subjects, and my last exam was yesterday for economics. Now, normally (as has been the case for every other year of exams) I would have been revising heavily every night or so. Not this year, Iâ€™ve done in total about 6 hours worth, which sounds a lot but it isnâ€™t when you imagine me doing it at midnight or watching the TV. So I have no idea what my grades are going to be like but I fear I will disappoint myself and my family.  I have had a lot on as well as school. I recently got a new job in a clothing store called River Island and they have been giving me a lot more hours a week, then there is being with Martin which I love doing, and that takes up most of time and I wouldnâ€™t have it any other way. But the bad things are that I havenâ€™t been out for a drink months, I havenâ€™t had time to go swimming or to the beach or doing anything summery, Iâ€™m always busy or skint (poor).  So, it looks like Iâ€™m will be bringing in more money, I will just be too busy and too tired to spend it on anything worthwhile. All I want to do after work or at the weekend is to jump into a big cool pool, but I have to walk somewhere because getting the bus will be a waste of money, and the sun gets hotter, and I get more annoyed,  so the sun does indeed jest. Summer fun!  "
25853,2510334,"11,June,2004",2004-06-11,"   Just before Christmas last year I decided that it would be a brilliant idea to get an eyebrow piercing, my main drive being to get it done before my ex-boyfriend did. I happened to casually mention in to a friend whilst in town and she insisted that we go and do immediately. After some deliberation I agreed and off we went. I subjected myself to a certain degree of pain and then paid Â£24 for the priviledge.  Now advice for any person thinking of doing something similarIfff you take it out for more than 2 hours it WILL close over. I thought 'that's fine, it won't hurt to much to shove a piece of metal though my skin'. Big mistake. One month later I ended up going to bed with a slightly swollen eye and woke up with a satsuma attached to my eye-socket. I wouldn't want to disgust you but after taking it out I realised what was actually in all the swelling.  So I made an appointment at my nearest surgery. 'I'm sorry you are not resgistered here' she says. 'That's right I moved about five minutes further from my old surgery and they kicked me out' I say. 'well if you come down at 5 PM you can fill out some forms and register'.  So I go to a history exam with one eye and then go straight to the doctor's and having not been ill that often was quite shocked but also amused at the things I saw. I followed the warren of corridors to the 'upstairs waiting area' in the surgery built in a Victorian House and took my seat. Across from me was a young man about 22 falling asleep, to my right was an old man... falling asleep, completely unable to keep his head up. to my left was a woman with her head back, quite possibly asleep. Then across the room was a man that looked completely terrified and this was only made worse when his name was called. he bowed his head, either to pray or deliberate whether he was going to go in. I just sat there and thought that my condition wasn't really worthy of an appointment compared to these people. in fact the only other person who looked relativlely calm and alert was a guy about my age 16 or 17 with a nice pair of legs,so I decided to pass the time taking glances at them. Not at all harmful, i'm still completely devoted to my boyfriend. I do remember sitting there and thinking he would probaly do the same thing in my position.  So that was about it they slowly got picked off one by one, and i eventually left with a course of antibiotics and the smell of TCP on my clothes.  So ot looks like all of got to concude is that doctor's surgerys are full of sick, tired people. a revelation I know!  "
25854,2510334,"09,June,2004",2004-06-09,"   I've sat here at my computer since my boyfriend left (about an hour ago) and trawled through various blog sites. I discovered a few things;  1. You can actually get an award for blogging from the guardian newspaper (a v. posh paper read by nearly employee of the educational system in the UK)  urlLink Guardian Article  2. It can actually get quite expensive to blog up to $130 for a years worth of blogging 3. In my opinion most blogs will never ever be read because of the time needed to trawl blogs to find a subject interesting to you but you might try  urlLink BlogPulse  4. And perhaps the single most important thing I have found out is that there is no perfect formula for blogging and its best to keep it simple and write a load of crap off the top of your head like I'm doing right now...  So, blogging, a valued tool to all Microsoft employees who dedicated minutes a day to enlightening their colleagues and captivated customers on, what I am sure to be, ground breaking developments.  "
25855,2510334,"08,June,2004",2004-06-08,"   I find myself becoming ever more tired, mainly due to the fact that I can't seem to drag myself away from the computer before 1 am every morning but also because of that weird anomaly that when someone begins to feel bored they start to fall asleep, ever worsened by this un-relenting heat, which would be fine if it hadn't been for the 6 moths of dismal British whether that we have just emerged from.  My weariness is set only to get worse as I have just agreed to work today,and most probably for the rest of this week, except that is for Thursday when I will be stuck in a lovely History exam, I can't even say that everything will be fine after I finished my last exam (Monday) but no, I have to go back to school and start learning next years work, then due to a severe lack of funds I will be working all summer. As is usually the case I will go back to school after six weeks more worn out than when I left.  adults think they have it hard, and tell us off for moaning about over-work and tiredness, but i don't see many of them going to school five days a week and then working week-ends as well, in fact I know some people including myself that work weekday evenings just to earn enough money to have a life. As my mums says 'you are old enough now to fend for yourself'. If that is true why does she receive ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â£50 in benefits from the government for me and get nearly ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â£300 pounds in tax breaks for 'supporting a family' wIeI i don't even live with her??  well must dash off to work, on a week-day, wheI i should be revising, but instead need to earn money to wheI i don't turn into some kind of hermit and never chance to see the world outside school, home and work!

Red death killed 22 actors, 29 chefs, 30 cooks, 100 civilians, 20 rich people, the queen and Prince Prospero. Police discovered this misfortune early yesterday morning when a erldely civilian that lived in the area was walking past, noticed it was quitter than normally. Doctors arrived after the police had got in and noticed that the daises that killed all of these people was a disease called red death. News reporters say that if they werenâ€™t locked up in the castle, and they were able to get out then they probably would of lived or at least saved a few people. Police are saying now that there is know one to blame except prince Prospero. Red death has now killed over 60,000 people. And red death is now one of the most deadly diseases a person is able to get. So if you know any one living near or has red death please warn them about it. And do not lock yourself in a building that is near red death. To tell if you have red death look for red blood pouring out from places like the face, legs, arms, eyes and feet etc. it takes 10 minutes at least to kick in so beware and stay away from red death or you could be or end up like one of the 203 killed in prince Prosperoâ€™s castle.

11906,2952444,"30,May,2004",2004-05-30,"   The Schoolyard bully  So there I was on my way to school hoping I wasnâ€™t seen by Bob. Bob was a menace. Every where he went be it, The school yard, the street, the shopping centre or even the park he started a fight. And he was only 12. I think he had a fight with nearly every one in town. For no particular reason either. Mainly it was just because he felt like a fight. But the worst thing about Bob was that he never lost a fight and that was really bad for the people that he decided to pick on twice like me Jon Jones. So any way back to my story.  There I was walking to school at 8:00, Monday morning hoping I didnâ€™t get seen by Bob but as usual there was Bob. Oh no I thought he was coming my way. â€œOh Hi Bobâ€ I said. â€œGive me your lunch money Squirtâ€ replied Bob. â€œNoâ€ I insisted, but it didnâ€™t matter, Within 6 seconds I was flat on my face and I didnâ€™t have any lunch money left either. I thought to my self ever day after my bashings why does Bob always pick on me. I wish I was big and strong like Bob sometimes.  The next day I was walking to school again same time same way and same amount of lunch money in my pocket as yesterday .But for some time Bob didnâ€™t come to day. I wounder why I think to my self I guess I am lucky in a sense. But just as I think I am safe here comes Bob right on time.  For some reason Bob just walked straight past me. I was so confused at this point of time. Then I saw Bobs mum walking with him as well and from that day on I never got bullied again and Bob he never bullied again because now Bobs mum walks with him every were.  The end  "

They have over 35 odd people in itâ€™s just is not home. I think the way to bring a solution to this problem is to reuse old building and make them in to flats/units for homeless and make each unit with two people in it of their choice. They need to make each unit really homey with stoves to make  there own food, food they are acutely interested in frigs to store there on food in, a phones to call friends and family even there own bathrooms so they donâ€™t have to share and it should cost from $80 a week to $100 a week. In these buildings in two or three units there should be staff, doctors and nurses. Also you should have a suggestion box for the homeless so they can have a say. So they can suggest thing s like couches, TVâ€™s, frigs beds and things like that just to make it a little homier. That way they will feel a lot happier and a lot happier about coming into an institution. Thatâ€™s all but I think it will make a real difference.   Because at the moment these institutions are really not home and we really need to do something about it.    Yours sincerely       Aaron Ziino Latrobe secondary school  "

I know that there are many good reasons for giving us homework like parents expectations and getting in to rutin and things like that but what good does it do us if it is not improving our education then itâ€™s a waste of time.&nbsp; It also can cause other problems such as family fights, eating disorders, bullying at school and it can dint your mental health.

11910,2952444,"14,July,2004",2004-07-14,"   So there I was having a nice nap in the warm warmth of the sun when suddenly I hear a crowed of voices, screaming yelling and voices laughing. So I open all of my five eyes to see what the hell is going on and what the hell is disturbing my sleep. And what I see is a class of year sevens. There are all jumping up and down, up and down waiting to get in. Thatâ€™s when I heard one of the worst things a spider like me can hear â€œletâ€™s get that spider and kill it. Letâ€™s take its legs of 1 by 1 ,  when we getâ€ said one of the many kids. I panic. I donâ€™t what to do or where to go but I have to get out of here some how or I am going to be one dead spider. Iâ€™ll be completely pulled a part.  So then I come to my senses and try to think of a way out of the room, I canâ€™t escape through the front door or I be found or even worse squished by all the feet. Thatâ€™s when I see a back door. â€œExcellentâ€ I think. Now I just have to get there and I know just how. Ill will go under the door. But just as I star to crawl the door flies open. â€œOooohhhh noâ€ I get about half way before some one picks me up â€œahhhâ€ there going to kill me. Iâ€™ll be mangulated. So I wriggle and wriggle, and squirm and hiss as hard as I can then they drop me on the floor. I quickly crawl away to the back door and crawl out under the door. Thank god Iâ€™m out of there I think to my self, and thank god im out alive. And that is the story of my great escape.   The end  "

He said to think with your brains and not with your heart - sanity. Everything is back to normal. My sister-in-law has united with my brother and he is smiling once more. The unborn child is well and growing and her belly shows some kinda sexiness in her appearance. Remember Demi Moore naked&nbsp;during her pregnancy&nbsp;in the cover of Rolling Stones mag?  Anyway, that's not important. My friends are happy for me because I am in love once more which they thought it's gonna be impossible. Naaa... she's kiddin.... she's looking for a victim..... I thought so too. But look what happens now?! It freaks me out at some point of time as well but I try not to let it take the best of me. Yes, I am scared of what's gonna happen next. So we better not make any plans cuz most of times like what I usually mentioned, it&nbsp;has&nbsp;never been fulfilled.  You know,&nbsp;I erase and rewind my&nbsp;own show. I&nbsp;was&nbsp;musing over the fact that we all deserve a second chance to make things better after being wiser.&nbsp;&nbsp;Looks like I am continuing where&nbsp;I stopped loving. It had been so cold, ey?      Come fall in love, my Beautiful."
30408,2952959,"23,July,2004",2004-07-23,"   I met old friends. They were looking great! They are married boys and girls now and they are happy! The wonders of parenting, that drives them to show their kids off to anyone. They are proud of their own pro-creations, perfectly borned&nbsp;(to a&nbsp;circumstance).   I met SB. He is 26 now, drives a car and has a son now. He was excited to show me a picture of his baby from his mobile fon. There I was smiling happily for him as I didn't know what else I was suppose to feel. I used to go out with him&nbsp;when I was a teenager. He was&nbsp;a handsome boy.&nbsp;&nbsp;   Along the way home in the bus after work, just now, I met my brother's ex-love. I attended her wedding when she was 21. I was like.....HAAAA!!!!! My GOD!!!! She looked gorgeous! And still looking a lot like a Barbie although with 2 kids now. I thought maternity could change one physically, but just look at her! I was amazed! Nothing changed when she showed me her children's pics in her fon. She looked beautiful, sexy, and nobody could tell she is a mother. And I forget that she's still in her late 20s. Her daughter, 6,&nbsp;looked like her. She's 25 when she had her 2nd child.   Behind those smile, I was swearing. Damn! Are these people with kids trying to show off or making me feel jealous or something? I am going 25 and I have nothing at all! Motherhood is what I wanna know after all there is to know. And where is my husband???   I remember how another mother told me about her experience of giving birth. She was in awe with the babe in her arms&nbsp;that was&nbsp;the most beautiful thing she ever saw to think how she smoked and drink before and during her pregnancy. Her baby was so perfect, she had to count all fingers and toes of her child. I craddled her baby&nbsp;too and the smell of nature on his head was like..... aaaaah..... smell of baby........ smell of&nbsp;nature.....   When Layla had her daughter, I was dying to see her baby.&nbsp;When I held her&nbsp;baby, I felt peaceful, cuz her baby was still sleeping even when I moved too much and talking loudly. Layla and her husband were smiling at each other looking at their baby.   Of course not forgetting a beautiful feeling I ever felt&nbsp;meeting my sister's daughter when she was one day old. I was overwhelmed I had to cry! I had been watching her how she grew in my sister's belly for nine months and finally she warmed herself in my embrace! She's my father's princess.&nbsp;And today, she talks a lot. &nbsp; "

30410,2952959,"17,July,2004",2004-07-17,"   I wonder why people just cannot co-orperate with each other. Things that are meant to be simple, turned out to be complicating. I know the reason very very well.  One made the other indispensible for his/her own selfish interest.  It's very human in fact, and I can never stop thinking why would we wanna do that in the first place.   I am only worried about what kinda ideas and values we inject into the children's mind unconsciously. Marriages of one's own choice scares me most of the time. It doubts me after what I had seen. But I believe, no one would wanna let divorce happen and ruin their lives.  If we just let go yesterday and learn how to be in control better, I'm sure things can be working out fine. We all have some soft spots for each other. If things turned out otherwise, then we have to re-assess ourselves, what went wrong. "
30411,2952959,"14,July,2004",2004-07-14,"   I was in daze once more. All those familiar feelings of being in love. Queasy tummy, heart skipped a beat, smiling and talking to myself while doing my work. I was feeling nice and lovely. Sweet and horny. I noticed there is a change in me.  Utopian Hunter was someone I never expected as appeared. I was resigned to fate of what the outcome was going to be. Interestingly, I was amazed when he approached me with nothing special but a cute smile and a bag of Hungry Jack's. He reminded me of any other tertiary students, yet, my jaws were locked open when he sat next to me, digging his dinner out from that bag and smile. He was hungry. The public never suspected it was meant to be a blind-date thingy. The weather was so cold and I was shivering inside - due to being nervous too?  We sat at a coffee joint later to prolong our conversation. I was too excited and nervous to think of any hot drinks to warm my body as he asked for my order. I was getting dodgy, so I volunteered to get our order instead of him. Soonest my order was ready, the voluntary disposition caused me to be drenched in my own latte probably due to an unstable tray that caused the tall glass to spill or was it really me who was a typical klutz whose life was never to serve. Yesss.... I felt stupid and clumsy... but I kept my cool, looked at the mess, smiling and laughing over my stupidity instead of standing there and really look stupid! Watta hell... I ordered for another and walked straight out to serve his bottled drink, a brief explanation of the mess, and rushed to the ladies to clear my own mess on my shirt, skirt and shoe.  All refreshed then, collected my 2nd latte (for free though I offered to pay for it) and walked straight to him who had been anxiously waiting. The loneliness bore him. We had brief discussion of anything we could think of. It was easy. Utopian Hunter has nothing against my thoughts and neither do I. It feels more natural unlike how I talked things with other men whose discussions were only apparently trying hard to impress me with their intellect. And I juz let them talk watever they could project their intellectual mind to me. While I played my role as a Barbie doll on display.  We parted at the train station in such an odd way. I think he felt strange too. In the whole journey smelling of latte, I was thinking that Allah is perfectly well acquainted to our daily affairs. God put a smile upon my face. And with this relief I'm getting, I figured...... my prayer was answered.......?? It feels like Saturday again!  Anyway, we chatted some more over the phone when we're already home! I found out, we are more or less on the same boat on why he is still unattached just like me. There are more gorgeous girls and good looking men out there looking for love/sex, and yet, we opted to be singled-out. I was guessing, he felt what I felt, like how any other users felt, the aftermath of any sorta affair that was going nowhere. And Radiohead sang True Love Waits. God knows how soul rationalised and cried over everything and anything before all this happened. "
30412,2952959,"11,July,2004",2004-07-11,"   I am busy floating high looking forward for my tomorrow. It's fun to think about what the future holds for me. Utopian Hunter is another soul I found through the popular Friendster.com, and his utopian search will never end. His presence felt special to me. I guess we were both relieved we didn't have to go very far to look for us.  Meanwhile, looking back how far I had left my yesterdays, most of me was congratulating myself for being able to feel my acid love again (even without to drop one) in which I thought I'd lost faith in it. Apparently, there's a part of me crying out - it's hard to say ""Goodbye"".  It led me to think from where I started as a 'reborn' in my lover's embrace, filled with so much love and hope and dreams till the time we had to stop. I became 21 years old forever now. I do miss him still and I'd be lying if I say I never loved him. Cuz he will be the reason for what I am today. "
30413,2952959,"12,August,2004",2004-08-12,"   Once upon a time, a Literature teacher once told me that to love is to possess. It reflects on my past relationship how tough it had been to keep one.  On my way home, I was still musing over the fact that everybody deserves a second chance after being wiser. It seems to me that we eventually take that oppurtunity for granted, all the time.  Utopian Hunter and I are good friends now. He said that to me when I was in need of an explanation of what's going between us. We are comfortable with each other no doubt our electrifying connection. I bet we were overwhelmed over each other's automatic response mentally, physically and spiritually, that we were withdrawn from each other in the end (God knows why). I thought he could be the right man for me. I sms to him before not to let another search be made in vain. I thought then.  We all are so full of love and hope. After a painful experience, maybe we give in just to spite them all. Perhaps, we are all still hurt along the way and frightened to see history which might repeats itself.  I felt so much and too much before, because I like to feel. I know what is real and what is lie in matters like this. Utopian Hunter is an egoist who will never admit what his dear heart truly says to him. He decided not to take his second chance. And there shall never be a second chance for him to pursue what we had. Something what I felt so right that has a future for both of us, for good. He loved me too, I know. Though it was such a short trip, I appreciate his presence in my life that helped me free my previous love completely, that wasn't meant to be.  So now what for Utopian Hunter and I? Nothing. Just nothing. Just another love that lets itself pass us by. And talks are cheap without doing it. "

But there are some major structural damage things done to my apartment, so I must pack up everything and camp out down at Mom & Dad's.   It truly doesn't look BAD from the outside, just.......weird.  I had at first thought that I would be able to just stuff everything in the kitchen, since to the human eye it appeared that only the one outside wall was damaged.   But to the non-human eyes (i.e., contractors and engineers) the ""gable"" was damaged and thus my apartment must be vacated.  Hence, this mad mad mad packing.

3943,3125462,"02,June,2004",2004-06-02,"   In School...    Right now, I'm in the computer lab, supposed to be looking for information on garbage user fees. But, I'm checking out Will's   Howitzer Puppies . These are genetically engineered puppies, to take over the world. More on this later.  "
3944,3125462,"03,June,2004",2004-06-03,"   I am in charge of the secret farewell present for someone I will name Lousie. Mid-June, she'll be leaving for South Africa. It turns out that she has already planned her own farewell party and  everyone  must bring something for her that will remind her of us. So the entire hackey group (except for Thomas) took 15 minutes of Science to do a digital photo.  We took two photos, actually. On the first one, Lauren gave Samie bunny ears.  Real  mature. Seeing as it was a  digital  image, we saw it instantly, and Samie found out instantly. She then, of course, demanded another shot (it  is  Lousie's farewell gift after all).

3945,3125462,"03,June,2004",2004-06-03,"   Man, Ã‰tudes Canadiennes is really boring. We're doing  more  research for our stupid debates. Mine is really simple. The proposition, you ask?  User Garbage Fees Should Be Implemented . The answer is really simple. If Garbage Fees are put into place, then a  whole  lot of illegal dumping will take place.  Yup, you guessed it, I'm posting instead of working again. That's because  I'm done all the research I need!  Crazy.  Today marks the day when I enter the 21st century. I just bought a new digital camera. It's a little piece of crap (600 kilopixels) that is just used for point-shoot-download-then-upload to the web. Expect my photo here anytime soon.  "
3946,3125462,"05,June,2004",2004-06-05,"   Man, oh man, was that a crazy party last night. But I'm getting ahead of myself. It all started in math class, where every day starts. I mean, seriously here people, math is always the first class of the day. Our regular math teacher couldn't be there, because she was coaching the girls' soccer team. Therefore, we had a sub. He normally taught Social Studies, but was brought in anyways. Seeing as we had a sub, everyone came over to sit at my table, mainly because I'm so cool. Will and I were working together on the math homework, and the sub came over and left us an interesting anecdote.   You know what happens when you wear a toque like that in the middle of a hot, summer day, don't you?   Um.. no.   It's the main reason why I don't allow hats or toques in my regular Social class.    [obviously disinterested]  Really.   Your toque doesn't let any moisture escape, and you know what that does to your scalp, right?    [fairly monotonous]  No, why don't you share it with me?    [not picking up on Will's hints]  Because of all the excess moisture, your scalp becomes all saturated and pruny&#8212;   uh-huh   &#8212;and then you know what happens?    [evidently annoyed at this point]  No.   Your hair falls out. It's an early sign of male pattern baldness.   Wow. Thank you for that disturbing thought. I'm doing my math now. My toque is still on my head.    After that was &#201;tudes Canadiennes, with  another  sub. As always, even though we already have a load of crap due very shortly, M. Sokalski left the sub an assignment due at the end of class. We had to find 10 difficult words and define them, and then summarize the promises of  all the federal political parties  of Canada. Most people in the class were complaining about the fact that it was too hard, so the sub decided that a communal effort was in order. I decided to forge my own trail and do my own work. To aide my brain, I decided to listen to  urlLink Strong Bad Sings .The sub, however, didn't like that. &ldquo;The human brain is incapable of doing two things at once.&rdquo; What he didn't know is that Will (who was also listening) and I are  excellent  debators. His main argument was that talking on a cell phone while driving leads to a lot of deaths, I mean, a  lot  of deaths. We countered with the fact that every car is equipped with a radio, and if you can  drive  and listen to music (i.e. multitask) then you  should  be able to  write  and listen to music without major problems. It was also been proven scientifically that the human brain can concentrate on up to 4 tasks  at the same time!  However, since the classroom is an autocracy, he won.  We still forged on our own. I wasn't  really  listening to him and the rest of the class, however, I do know that he talked about the Mandarin language for at least 15 minutes. During this time, I became really bored  (wink wink)  and rested my head in my hand. My hand happened to be holding an earpiece. I don't know how it got there. After a couple of songs, though, he noticed and threatened to confiscate my discman if I did it again. So, I turned it up real loud (which with headphones in isn't loud at all) and listened with it on my desk very quietly. In case anyone's keeping score, the class finished about 5 of 10 difficult words, and I finished about 5 words too. However, I decided that a summary of the political partied would be more beneficial to me and finished that as well. It's something I call "" time-management "". All while doing the impossible multi-tasking! Hah!  Next came lunch, which was extended by about half-an-hour to incorporate a live band, BBQ, and the  Big Ollie Contest ! It was enjoyed, however, with a good toss of the disc.  Nothing else exciting happened except for the party. The walk to Louise's house from Kelvin is about 15-20 minutes. A ride would take about 3. And it's less energy expended by my body. So when Samie offered Lauren and me a ride, I naturally accepted. I didn't know however, that it would include a trip to Costco and then Samie's house. It added about an hour and a half to the 3 minute trip. But it was still a cool party.  Phhew! I have to get out of the house. This will be finished later.  "
29380,3126039,"13,April,2004",2004-04-13,"   The best moments in life are always spent with the ones that you love.    Yesterday was one of the best days that I have ever had with Kenny. We didn't spend the whole day together but the time that we did spend together was great. He went to the resort with my mom, sister, brothers, my brother Anthony's girlfriend, and me. When we got there we played pool with my brothers and then my brothers and his girlfriend went down to the beach, we told them that we would meet them down there when we were done playing our game. We went down to the beach to watch the sunset, which I thought was really cute. However my stupid brother had to runin the moment by throwing a can at Kenny which pissed me off. They decided to get drunk at act stupid, but anyways. So we walked back up to the resort and went into the spa, where we had some more alone time. We talked about things, had quiet time. Then we got out went and took  our shower (not together), hung out some more. Then we went by the fire pit and sat with my mom, and my brother's girlfriend. Then we started home. We were in the, the very back seat, he held me in his arms and we sat there and stared into each others eyes. I love him soooo much, and to tell you the truth, what I am about to say I never thought I would say, at least not at this young of an age. I want to spend the rest of my life together with him, I wanna get married to him. I want what happened last night, to happen ever night. When I was down on the beach with him. I almost fell asleep in his arms watching the sun and I loved that moment I wanna spend the rest of my life falling asleep in his arms. He makes me happier then I ever thought I could be.  "
29381,3126039,"10,April,2004",2004-04-10,"   Have you ever wondered how your family would react if they found out your biggest secret that you know they wouldn't like. Tonight I found out that my whole family knows mine. My parents don't want me to know that they know, because if they did they would have talked to me about it. My brother on the other hand, I thought when he found out he would want to go and kill someone. Instead he talked to me about it helped me out and gave me the support I need. He may not be happy with it but he learned instead of getting pissed just to be there for me. Some times they way people act are really different then you think they will.  "
29382,3126039,"09,April,2004",2004-04-09,"   I really hate it when people lie to me about things that they say that there going to do. Don't tell me that your not going to do something or you are going to do it, if you are just going to do the opposite of what you said. You know what I mean. This has happened to me twice in less then a week and the sad thing is it was from the same person. People don't have to lie to me, I rather have them tell me the truth then me get mad at them later when I find out they did otherwise or is going to do otherwise. Even if they think that it will hurt me I rather hear it from that person then from someone else. I really like the idea of posting my thoughts, its easier for me to get out what I have to say then always holding it inside because I am afraid of hurting someone or I am afraid that that person might get mad at me for saying what I have to say. This way I can say what I need and if that person lies to me or something I can tell them how I feel but not actually tell them because they might  not know this is about them.  Well my day today was really boring. I got up and I went to work. Then I got home and I did nothing. I really miss my Kenny I really haven't spent anytime with him the past 2 days. Yesterday he had to load the truck for drumline so I didn't get to hang out with him at lunch and then when I got back from lunch he was leaving and then today he is at Champs. Tomorrow I have to do family stuff because it is Easter, Monday I hope that he can go to Disneyland with us if not I will be sad because that means that I don't get to spend anytime with him during spring break because he is leaving on Wed., most likely, to go to the river with Matt, and other people I rather not mention. Tues. he has work and doesn't get off until 5 and we are suppose to go to Kokohos but that might not happen. Oh well I guess that it is his decision if we spent anytime together over spring break.  "
29383,3126039,"09,April,2004",2004-04-09,"   I saw one of these in one of my friend's (Erin) profiles and I liked it so I decided to do one too. So for the first one I thought that I would tell you a little about me.  I am 17 years old and I live somewhere in the U.S. I am going out with a really great guy that I love more then anything. We have been going out for the past year and he means the everything to me. (and for all those people that say that me and him aren't going to last you can just go to hell.) I have some really great friends that are always there for me in my times of need and they always know what to say to put a smile on my face no matter what. They are always there to talk to and they all know that I am here if they wanna/need someone to talk to or just someone to cheer them up. Kenny, Erin, Jess, Bobby, Matt, and Jessie are the greatest people on this earth, they all have there weird ways of acting and I love it. These are the people that I love and always will love.   There are some people that I hate and can't stand to be around but like it says above if I loved those people before I always will no matter what. If you know me really well you know who I am talking about. These people may have ruined something for me and I cant trust them anymore or doesn't respect my personal space, but if they try hard enough they may get my respect back and my friendship which would be great. I would love to be friends with these people again it just wouldn't be the same as it was before because deep down inside I will always no what they did and have that feeling but at least I will still have that friend.    Always remember that love lasts forever not matter how much you try to let that love go, deep down inside it will always be there!!  "
29384,3126039,"23,May,2004",2004-05-23,"   PROM NIGHT THE BEST NIGHT    I Had so much fun last night! Kenny made me feel so special, because all night he was telling me how beautiful I was. I cant wait until I get the pictures of last night they are going to be so good. However, me and Kenny's couple picture might be weird because of the way that the lady made us pose but I don't care as long as we don't look funny. I really hope that girls group photo that we get is the funny one because I really like that one.    All I have left to say is thank you Kenny for making my night so special. I love you more then anything.  "
29385,3126039,"12,May,2004",2004-05-12,"   I am just afraid that I am going to loose him!!   Have you ever got mad at someone for the stupidest reasons? lately I have and its only because I am scared that I am going to loose him to someone else or just loose him in a couple of months because it isn't going to work out, and the reason it doesn't work out is because of distance and never being able to see each other. That is why I have been so mad lately its just because I am scared of loosing him forever. I love him and I don't wanna loose him I wanna spend the rest of my life with him. I am just scared that him going to a different school next year is going to break us up, or him finding someone else. I wanna tell him how I feel but I don't know how. Someone help me to not be so worried. I love him and I don't want him to leave me because I don't know what I would ever do with out him. He is the only good thing that I have in my life. Well I have my friends but that's different.   I love Kenny more then anything on this earth and I don't wanna loose him.  "

So she's talking and saying how I should wach my mouth or I'll end up with my ass getting kicked. And I told her I'm like ""you don't want to mess with me I know people people high up"" (like cops) I told her about my sisters probation officer and they must have miss heard me or something because next thing I know they all think my sister is a cop and shes only 16. so in conclusion I think that people should stand up for them selves!!

6364,3215937,"27,April,2004",2004-04-27,"   I just learned about Blogging last night on the news.  I thought it was interesting. I wanted to do it too.  So, here goes.  I am not sure what to put in here.  Today has been a ""blah"" day.  I'm ready to go home.  The sun is out and it's so nice outside.  It only stays this way for about a month and then it's boiling hot outside and you begin to sweat the second you walk out the door.  That's Texas for ya.  Or Ya'll.  I'm an accountant, and no, I'm not boring.  I just happened to do this, not planned or anything.  I do like my job and I've been here for almost 7 years.  Can you tell that I get bored?  This is the perfect solution for that I guess.  I have three dogs and a part time cat.  My cat, Buddy Lee, has been coming and going lately. I think it's because it's Spring and he's not fixed.  I know, shame on me.  If he would stay home long enough, I'd take him to get fixed.  I've got two Pomeranians and a mut.  I love animals.  I would love to live on a farm someday.  Well, I'm not sure how stupid I sound so I better stop now.  "
6365,3215937,"03,May,2004",2004-05-03,"   Jack Nicholson once asked ""What if this is as good as it gets?"" and I wonder the same thing.  It seems that we're always striving to be smarter, skinnier, funnier, or more popular among our peers.  Am I just going to die trying?  I wonder how much I do for myself and how much I do for others?  My therapist told me, after I unloaded on her about my marriage, that I'm a victim.  I cringed when she said that.  I don't want to be a victim, but I guess I put myself here and if I don't do anything about it, then I am really just a glutton for punishment.  God, it's sad that I'm too lazy or scared to make any advancements towards happiness.  I just take things day by day and nothing changes.  The only thing that makes me happy is my son.  My son also drives me up the wall sometimes, but I'm sure that's normal for a toddler.  At least he doens't know any better which is more than I can say for my husband.    Well, I keep on trying.  I go to the gym, I try and eat right every now and then.  I lay awake at night and think of how great I looked right before I got pregnant.  I had lost about 30 pounds by running and eating right.  I looked so good.  I was wearing a size 4.  Those jeans, which I refuse to throw out are in my closet now.   I look at them and tell myself that I'll wear them again soon.  I wonder where my self control has gone?  I was so good, but now I see a cookie and I fall apart.  If I could just get myself back to where I was.  I was in the ""mode"".  Nothing could stop me.  Nothing could tempt me either.  Geez, I was so good.  It is harder now becuase I have a son and I can't just go out the door and run anymore.  I bought a running stroller but somehow it's broken and the wheels are flat.  Good excuse, huh?  That thing is a real pain in the ass anyways to run with.     Well, crap, duty calls.  Gotta work.  "
6366,3215937,"03,May,2004",2004-05-03,"   I'm back.  I'm also bored.  I have been feeling so numb lately.  I think it's the Effexor.  I just feel blah.  I don't really have any emotions but anger.  That's great for my husband, who I take everything out on.  Things are so great on the homestead.  I'm trying to take things day by day though.  Some kid bit my son this week.  I know which one too.  A little brat with a shaved head.  That little shit.  He's like 6 years old and my son is 16 months.  Talk about a bully.  My poor little man.  If his Gamma knew, she would throw a fit.  Tristen, my son is so clingy right now.  I guess it just goes with his age.  He's a Momma's boy for sure.  That's okay, in a few years he won't want me anymore, he'll want his Daddy to play sports or other ""manly"" things.   Right now he literally hangs from my shirt while I'm tyring to do stuff.  I'm the only one who can rock him to bed and hold him most of the time.  He's so sweet though.  He's already a little dare-devil. He climbs on everything and gets up on the table.  Every one says he's ""all boy"".  Well, my stupid contacts are killing me so I'm going to check my insurance to see if I'm elligable to get some more.  Ciao.  "
6367,3215937,"08,June,2004",2004-06-08,"   Wow, I really need to blog more often.  It's been a long time.  Well, where to start?  The past two weeks have been very crazy for me.  My life has been flipped upside down and then back around again.  I found out just before Memorial Day that I was pregnant.  My husband and I were very shocked, and then exicted.  My husband swore that it will be a girl.  I thought so too.  I tried to hold off on telling everyone, but within a few days I had told everybody.  I went to the doctor and did all that fun lab work and so far, I was four weeks and everything looked okay.  Four days later I started bleeding.  This didn't happen with my first pregnancy so I freaked out.  I kept on bleeding and I called my OB but he was not there and my old OB was on call for him.  Yuck.  All he said was for me to lay down.  I did that.  I knew though, deep down, that it was over.  My husband told me to quit being so negative but it wasn't that at all.  A woman knows her body and I knew this wasn't right.  The next Tuesday my fears were confirmed.  A miscarriage.  I cried and I cried some more.  I felt that I was to blame.  I felt a relief as horrible as that sounds and then I felt guilt.  I felt a lot of things.  I didn't know that one out of every ten pregnancies ends up in miscarriage.  I'm just glad mine happened so early.  So, me and my husband decided to try again in about 3 months.   At first we weren't sure we were ready for another baby, but after this has happened, I guess it makes you want it more.  I had already had my mind wondering about my little girl and what we would name her.  I thought about what I would decorate her room in and I even came across my old baby clothes and a dress that I wore home from the hospital when I was born.  Every day it gets a little better.  If I sit and think about it, I want to cry again but I know I've got to get over it.  My body has been in shock basically.  All the pregnancy symptoms have gone now and that is another part that makes it hard.  I had actually started to ""feel"" pregnant.  I have been spending a lot of time with my son and I'm so grateful that I have him and he's healthy.  I love him so much I can harldy stand it.  He's so beautiful and perfect to me.  I really am blessed to have him.     Work... work.  I feel so unappreciated.  I keep telling myself ""just wait until our reviews in August""... I can't wait.  I have so much to say.  I am the fastest and most efficient person in this department and I want the title to back that up.  I was promoted to ""Senior"" accoutant a couple of years ago but my boss's boss shot that down.  Probably becuase they don't want to pay me more.  I've been here for almost 7 years now and I think I deserve it.  I know that everyone is replaceable but I would like to think of myself as an asset to the company.  My husband resigned from his job.  Normally I would be so mad at him but his boss was a scum ball.  This guy owns the company and treats all his employee and customers like shit.  He does this bait and switch thing where he sells them a very expensive door and then installs a cheap one instead.  He takes people's money and doesn't order the product.  He's on credit hold with several vendors.. I knew my husband shouldn't stay there long.  So, now he's trying to get his own business going.  Precision Door and Trim.  I helped him pass out flyers door to door th is past weekend.  He's been getting calls and has a few jobs lined up.  I hope it works out for him, and us.  It's very scary but I see so many people with their own company's and they do very well.  Look at his scum bag boss, he's a crook and has a huge business.  Oh, and he also punched my husband when he came asking for his last paycheck.  We're suing him and taking him to court.  The police came out and seem to be on our side.  They said that this isn't the first time they have delt with Bobby.  They want him out of business and so do I.  Well, I better get some work done.  "
6368,3215937,"12,July,2004",2004-07-12,"   Happy Birthday to me.  I am 26 years old today- well, at 6:23pm I will be.  We had a get together for my birthday yesterday at my brother's house.  It felt surreal.  It felt like a dream, it always does when the attention is on me.  I woke up with a sore throat yesterday morning.  I went out with my girlfriends Saturday night and had some fun.  I hate being the fat girl though.  I did the Limbo contest and lost.  My friend Sarah with her big ole' boobies almost won.  She just broke up with her boyfriend a few days ago.  She seemed fine to me though.  She's so skinny and cute, she will have no problem finding a transition guy or two.  So, well, I had my first orgasm in like 2 years ago the other night.  Talk about relief.  It wasn't a great one, but at this point I'll take what I can get.  My husband and I talked seriously about our marriage on Saturday morning and I cried and told him that I can't imagine my life being this way forever.  He said things can change, blah blah blah.  Whatever.  My friends called me today at work to say that I should call Shannon for a booty call.  Lord knows I've played out that scenario a million times.  Right now, I guess I'm just not in the mood.  I'm not up to my full potential today.  I feel kind of sickly and it's Monday.  It's so weird to think about cheating on your spouse and not sense any guilt.  I feel like I deserve to.  That probably sounds horrible.  Like I told Jana, Shannon doesn't count as cheating because I have slept with him before!  Right?  Is that the rule?  Geez, I'm awful.  I wonder what I would tell Tristen if I cheated on his daddy?  How could I explain it so that he didn't hate me?  I'm such a chicken shit though, I'd probably never do anything anyway.  I sit back and think about it.  BUT, if he just happened to be at the same bar as me one night.... Well, we could talk, right?  I am too fat to see him now.  I've got to loose some weight first.  I went to the gym today and ate an Atkins friendly wrap.  I'm determined to get this lard off.  Well, gonna go now.  "
6369,3215937,"06,July,2004",2004-07-06,"   I don't blog nearly enough as I should. I got in a fight with my husband last night.  He told me I was bitter like my mom was when she was married to my dad.  So, I said maybe when I'm forty-something I'll find true happiness like her too.  So he said are you happy?  I said no.  He got up, broke the lamp and went to the couch.  I laid there for a while thinking.  I didn't really care to go and get him but I figured I should.  I did because I'm married and you're supposed to do that stuff, right?  Even if you don't give a shit.  So I went in there and told him to come to bed.  He said that I'm weird and one day I'm fine and then I go and say something like that to him.  Then I asked him why he told me I was bitter?  He didn't have an answer.  He thinks that if we ignore our problems, they go away.  We haven't said anything else about last night and I bet you anything he thinks it's all fine again.  Meanwhile, it's another unresolved issue for me.  We went to the lake over the weekend I saw couples loving each other and saying nice things about one another.  I was so jealous and sad.  I don't have that.  Am I supposed to suffer through a marriage like that?  I feel that my husband doesn't want me sexually and I know it's my fault.  I am fat and ugly and don't have anything attractive about me.  I've always blamed myself.  I was thinking yesterday about how much I need passion and that stuff and I figure if he won't let me get a divorce, then he's going to have to let me cheat then.  I can't go on for the rest of my life only having sex once every couple of months.  Maybe that makes me selfish but I can't help it.  I'm only human and I don't think I'm asking that much.  My life is miserable sometimes.   I dreamt of walking around a mall looking for any attractive guy I could find.  I just wanted to have sex with someone, anyone.  I wish Brad weren't in San Diego...

6370,3215937,"05,August,2004",2004-08-05,"   Jeremiah,   I am writing this to you because it seems any time we try to talk, it turns to an argument and I think I am done with those. I've been doing a lot of thinking lately and I keep coming to the same conclusion. We fight so much and we are both so angry and I worry about the effect it has on our son. I am going to move out. I don't want to argue about anything and I'm willing to listen to any requests you might have about Tristen or anything else. I am so afraid of hurting you, but at the same time- you have been hurting me for so long. Maybe you don't even realize it, or it's a subconscious thing. I keep a lot buried inside and now it's festered up and overflowed. I've never felt so worthless in my life. I know that a lot of this is due to me and all my problems and I need to work on those. I have realized though, that I can only work on these on my own. Time apart will help us realize what we both want from life. There's no way that Tristen would not benefit from this. Right now he has two agitated and angry parents who yell at each other an at him daily. It hurts me to the core to think about what we might be doing to him. I love him more than life itself and that's why this decision is so important. We will always be linked together through Tristen even if we do not live together. I want to be happy, and to find happiness. I cannot find it with you right now. I beg you to understand my decision and to let me do what needs to be done. If I stay, I will only become more bitter and hateful. I can't even stand myself these days. I care for you and your feelings and the last thing I want to do is hurt you or take anything away from you. I promise to never do that with Tristen, but as for myself, I must go and sort out my thoughts. They say if you love someone, let them go.       Love, Shelly  "
6371,3215937,"04,August,2004",2004-08-04,"   Omigod, I'm screaming on the inside. I'm ripping and tearing and I want to bust loose so bad. Isn't it horrible to know exactly what you want but don't know how to get it? Screw all this fear! Can't something make this easier? I wish he would hit me. That would be the best thing ever, then I could leave and not feel the guilt. Maybe I should provoke it? What am I saying? Am I nuts?  Every time I read an email from Brad, I smile so big and I can't even make myself stop. This big, goofy ass smile across my face. I started reading ""The Notebook"" last night and the romance and passion has taken it's toll. I want that. God, do I want that. I want to feel love again. I want someone to want me, right here and right now. I want that kind of urgency. I have to realize that I control my destiny, no one else. What am I going to do? I can't even afford a divorce I think. I don't know. Only if it were uncontested. I bet he would argue over every last detail. He can't stop me from moving out though. Where would I go? To my mom's? That's so far away. Ugh....  "
6372,3215937,"04,August,2004",2004-08-04,"   Call me a hopeless romantic, but I think that I'm destined to find my true love out there.  I don't think the one I'm with is that at all.  I've made up my mind.  I don't want to have another baby.  I'm not going to.  What I want is to get a seperation.  I want to start my own life over again.  I want my independance again and I don't ever want to marry again.  I remember getting into fights in the past where when he threatened to leave I would cry and beg for him to stay.  My heart would freeze and hurt but know.... oh no.  When we fight and threats start, I feel relief.  I feel like, is this it?  Will this be the last fight?  Can we get a divorce now?  I'm so afraid.  Not of being alone, not of starting over.  I'm afraid of hurting him and I'm afraid of what I will do to him.  Not one person can say that Tristen would be better off if we stayed married.  We would both be better parents apart.  I just can't do this anymore.  I'm too young to be in this spot.  He'll be home soon and I don't want him to read this blog.  Marriage is so stupid and pointless to me.  Why do you want to tie yourself to one person and have to agree with everything for the rest of your life?  I want to be me again.  "
6373,3215937,"02,August,2004",2004-08-02,"   It all started with a dream about a monkey. Thursday night I dreamt that Brad was in town and I met up with him and his friend. We first met up in my room, at my dad's house. My sister was sitting there with me and my dresser fell on us but I got out of the way. My sister's head was bleeding and stuff and I was so mad at the dresser. I took it outside and threw it on the ground and broke it. I remember that I think I had my pajamas on and make up from the day before. Then it went on to a street in Duncanville. I was standing there with Brad and his friend and I kept kissing him. He was a little stand-off-ish. I was watching someone's spider monkey and it kept running and jumping all over the place and I ended up having to put the damn thing in my purse and zipping it up. Brad went home and went to bed and I came there and tried to get him to come back out. It was weird.    I called him on his cell phone on Friday afternoon. He answered but I could tell he was in a car with the windows down. He said he was in a jeep. I could barely hear him but he asked how I was and how Tristen was. I told him that I would call back later when I could hear him better. I went to my softball game after that. Jeremiah went to watch the Tyson fight so after I got Tristen in bed, I snuck outside and called him again. No answer. I left a message. I never heard back. Oh well. I don't know if it's Brad, or the idea that he represents. Something different. Any guy seems perfect when you live with Jeremiah. He basically called me out on Thursday and said that I'm a bad mother. He said I don't watch Tristen good enough and that he only gets hurt when I am watching him. He can make me feel two inches tall and I think he likes it that way. It's wierd because I don't see myself with him for the rest of my life, but I don't know what to do. I'm scared... I'm also torn. One day I want to have another baby and the next I want to get the hell out. He wants to sell our house and build another one. All that does is scare me. I don't want anymore comittments. Then I think, I'm such a looser. How can I encourage Jana, who's pregnant, to leave her man when I'm too chicken shit to do it myself? I guess it's easier for me to tell Jana that but I realize how much harder it is to actually do it. I can convince myself that she'll be okay and better off here but can she do that for herself? I guess if I could snap my fingers and make anything happen, I would have a rent house that Jana and I could live in. We could raise our kids together and be there when times are tough. You don't need a man. You don't  have  to be married. When did it get easier to stay and take the abuse than to leave and set yourself free? What do I tell my husband? You irritate the shit out of me and I want to start seeing other people? Yeah, that would go over real good. He almost hit me again the other day. I didn't change the cat litter so he took the cat and was trying to leave and take her to the pound. I threw a plastic cup at his truck and he came charging back out and forced me into the house and I was sure he would choke me or something. He restrained himself though. I don't need that drama in my life. Not in front of my son either. Woe is me...  "
16780,3288591,"23,May,2004",2004-05-23,"   If you follow the progress of the  urlLink MARID IETF working group  â€¦  â€¦ then youâ€™ll know that the prospect of a spam free future is within our grasp. The champions for competing standards for MTA Authorization Records in DNS (MARID) are beginning to agree on standards for the definition of email domain usage policies. Once implemented, the MARID proposal will ensure that email that purports to be from a domain (mimecast.com for example) actually does come from that domain.  Most anti-spam pseudo guru types will try to tell you that this does nothing much for the spam problem â€“ but the application of a little brain to the process reveals a massively powerful anti-spam system in the works. Most of the people who donâ€™t understand the MARID proposal are of the content filtering, artificial intelligence ilk. Weâ€™ll get to these poor folk in a moment.  Firstly, if every email from a domain actually is from that domain, then â€œspoofingâ€ (also known as â€œJoe Jobbingâ€ â€“ which describes the use of someone elseâ€™s email address without their knowledge) and â€œphishingâ€ (dolling up an email to look like itâ€™s from someone you know in order to get you to give up some info or cash) would simply cease to exist. At first glance, this seems like it has nothing to do with those hundreds of emails you receive suggesting that your sex life needs a boost, but the angel is in the detail.  Secondly, if every email can be proven to be from its purported domain, then the world can be rid of â€œbounce spamâ€. Hereâ€™s the geek description of Bounce Spam â€¦  Bounce Spam is what you get when someone Joe Jobs you to an invalid email address.  Basically, this happens when a spammer uses your email address to email someone non-existent at a valid domain. The email server (usually a pretty dumb one) accepts the email because itâ€™s destined for an email domain that the mail server deems as its responsibility. The email server then works out that the domain is valid, but the actual recipient in invalid. The mail server then dutifully constructs a bounce message â€“ and delivers it to the source of the original email (your email address).  You end up with a bounced message telling you that an email you *never* sent has *not arrived* â€“ or worse, you end up with a bounce message telling you that an email you never sent WITH A VIRUS could not be delivered. Either way, if you are not fully informed as to why this could happen, you panic.  The MARID proposal resolves this problem.  So, why would an end to spoofing, phishing and bogus bounces also be the end of spam?  The net result of the MARID change is the restoration of trust in email. After MARID, the only way to deliver an email will be through the use of a legitimate email domain. This, in turn, leads to reputation based controls for domains â€“ so good domains who act responsibly and do not send unsolicited commercial email (UCE) get to deliver their emails easily. Bad domains (those that deserve a sever spanking) find themselves locked up within black lists for abuse of their domain. These policies cannot be enforced in a pre-MARID world.  Right, back to the title of this blog. If MARID succeeds, then content filtering systems will be switched off. Most content filtering systems are based on the idea that software can accurately determine desired from undesired messages based on the contents of the message. The anti-spam industry invested heavily in trying to figure this stuff out, but failed to realise two things:  1. We havenâ€™t invented artificial intelligence yet â€“ and itâ€™s a long long long way off.  2. Had we already invented AI, it still wouldnâ€™t be able to work out what we want, or do not want, to read. This is because we havenâ€™t invented (or even proven the existence of) ESP yet.  One manâ€™s spam is another manâ€™s email newsletter (which is currently being binned by an ultra-clever, ultra-expensive false positive solution shipped by an anti-spam vendor).  If I ask for a glitzy, image saturated HTML based email newsletter from CNN, then I expect to receive it. I donâ€™t expect some brainless software to â€œfilterâ€ it out for me. Anti-spam vendors have had their day. Now itâ€™s time to get back to using our email powers for good.  Roll on MARID  "
16781,3288591,"14,May,2004",2004-05-14,"   The EU seems unable to stop itself from legalising software and business method patents. Iâ€™m not going to get into why software patents are bad, as there are many web sites dedicated to pointing these things out.  Have a look at  urlLink http://www.ffii.org.uk  if you need the background.  What I am going to suggest is a solution. Simple.  SUE THE PATENT OFFICE.  The idea of patents is fine, and I firmly believe in the processes by which a patent should be granted. The big problem stems from the fact (and there are many examples) that the patent examiners tend to err on the side of granting a patent if it is presented in sufficiently minced patent speak (possibly because they really donâ€™t understand what it means).  Given enough time, you can author a patent application for anything at all â€“ and â€œproveâ€ the inventive step if you use enough of this patent garbage speak. Donâ€™t believe me? â€“ have a peek at Google, and search for â€œpatently absurdâ€. Youâ€™ll find good articles on thousands of ridiculous patents that have been granted.  The patent office needs to take more responsibility for what it is doing, and it needs an incentive to NOT grant a patent. Patent examiners should be rewarded for finding prior art and breaking the gobbledygook code used by patent authors to get to the true inventive step in order to disprove it.  The patent office (here or wherever you are in the world) will not change all by itself. It must be made to change by suffering defeat after defeat in lawsuit after lawsuit challenging bogus patents. The patent office must start to feel the weight of responsibility that comes with their power to assign rights of invention, and it must change its default behaviour to that of declining to issue patents.  One other change needs to be applied, in my view. Patent authors should be charged for patent rejections. This means that all of the time (in billable hours) that is applied to investigating the patent should be charged to the author of the patent upon rejection. The patent office should carry the can for the costs if it passes a patent. This changes the dynamic for patent application, and starts to ensure that bogus applications are discouraged, thereby freeing up the resources of the patent office.  Patents are good (even very specific software patents), but the patent office is bad. It needs to get a severe spanking â€“ and we can all help by banding together to sue the pants off it (spanking generally works best with trousers down).  "
16782,3288591,"10,May,2004",2004-05-10,"   My father was particularly interested in writing. He spent a reasonable amount of his spare time in front of an old manual typewriter and laboriously produced sheet after ink stained sheet of text. He passed away when I was quite young, and the only thing I have left of his, is an old leather suitcase containing all of his written work.  I have no idea if his work was any good, but the fact that the work endures is possibly the most important thing about it - for me anyway. This blog is hopefully a new form of enduring written work and, no matter how bad the prose, grammar, diction (and spleling) - I hope it endures and is of value to those people who find it.  Last year I was introduced to some really smart and creative people. After realising that we had similar goals in business, and in the tech sector, we decided to co-found a small software company called Mimecast â€“ which is now based in London. The trials and tribulations of launching a startup are well known, so I wonâ€™t bore you with the details (Iâ€™ll hold that off for another blog).  Iâ€™m a bit of a technical general dogs body within the company. I try to help with a bit of technology vision, a little bit of business application, a little bit of technical pre sales, a little bit of software design and a lot of coding. I wouldnâ€™t have it any other way.  This blog will undoubtedly contain both random and considered thought. More random than considered I can assure you. To me, blogs are like steam valves for an overactive mind. Sometimes its necessary to release an idea or a thought pattern in order to make way for new thoughts and new ideas. The problem is that without a mechanism like a blog, those purged thoughts and ideas may be lost to infinity.  The reason why this blog is called â€œThe Mud Island Blogâ€ is because Iâ€™m a slightly sun scorched South African who now lives in, what most South Africans consider to be, the very cold and wet England. If you happen to love the development of software, then the wetter the climate the better. I personally donâ€™t think the weather is so bad, but I probably donâ€™t get away from my notebook long enough to notice one way or the other. I live in a small village about an hour away from London, and there is an awful lot of mud around. I can tell the season by whether itâ€™s frozen or soggy.  However you got here â€“ welcome.  "

11708,3295677,"29,July,2004",2004-07-29,"   OK Ladies, Here is some more ammunition for you!&nbsp;  A man was sick and tired of going to work every day while his wife stayed home. He wanted her to see what he went through so he prayed:  ""Dear Lord: I go to work every day and put in 8 hours while my wife merely stays at home. I want her to know what I go through, so please allow her body to switch with mine for a day. Amen.""    God, in his infinite wisdom, granted the man's wish. The next morning, sure enough, the man awoke as a woman. He arose, cooked breakfast for his mate, awakened the kids, set out their school clothes, fed them breakfast, packed their lunches, drove them to school, came home and picked up the dry cleaning, took it to the cleaners and stopped at the bank to make a deposit, went grocery shopping, Then drove home to put away the groceries, paid the bills and balanced the checkbook. He cleaned the cat's litter box and bathed the dog.   Then it was already 1 P.M. and he hurried to make the beds, do the laundry, vacuum, dust, and sweep and mop the kitchen floor. Ran to the school to pick up the kids and got into an argument with them on the way home. Set out milk and cookies and got the kids organized to do their homework.&nbsp;    Then set up the ironing board and watched TV while he did the ironing. At 4:30 he began peeling potatoes and washing vegetables for salad, breaded the pork chops and snapped fresh beans for supper.    After supper, he cleaned the kitchen, ran the dishwasher, folded laundry, bathed the kids, and put them to bed. At 9 P.M. he was exhausted and, though his daily chores weren't finished, he went to bed where he was expected to make love, which he managed to get through without complaint.    The next morning, he awoke and immediately knelt by the bed and said, â€œLord, I don't know what I was thinking. I was so wrong to envy my wife's being able to stay home all day. Please, oh please, let us trade back.""    The Lord, in his infinite wisdom, replied, ""My son, I feel you have learned your lesson and I will be happy to change things back to the way they were.

11709,3295677,"07,July,2004",2004-07-07,"   A little girl had been shopping with her Mom in Wal-Mart. She must have been 6 years old, this beautiful red haired, freckle faced image of innocence. It was pouring outside. The kind of rain that gushes over the top of rain gutters, so much in a hurry to hit the earth it has no time to flow down the spout. We all stood there under the awning and just inside the door of the Wal-Mart.   We waited, some patiently, others irritated because nature messed up their hurried day. I am always mesmerized by rainfall. I got lost in the sound and sight of the heavens washing away the dirt and dust of the world. Memories of running, splashing so carefree as a child came pouring in as a welcome reprieve from the worries of my day.   The little voice was so sweet as it broke the hypnotic trance we were all caught in ""Mom, let's run through the rain,"" she said.   ""What?"" Mom asked.   ""Let's run through the rain!"" She repeated.   ""No, honey. We'll wait until it slows down a bit,"" Mom replied.   This young child waited about another minute and repeated: ""Mom, let's run through the rain,""  ""We'll get soaked if we do,"" Mom said.   ""No, we won't, Mom. That's not what you said this morning,"" the young girl said as she tugged at her Mom's arm.   This morning? When did I say we could run through the rain and not get wet?   ""Don't you remember? When you were talking to Daddy about his cancer, you said, 'If God can get us through this, he can get us through anything!""   The entire crowd stopped dead silent. I swear you couldn't hear anything but the rain. We all stood silently. No one came or left in the next few minutes.   Mom paused and thought for a moment about what she would say. Now some would laugh it off and scold her for being silly. Some might even ignore what was said. But this was a moment of affirmation in a young child's life. A time when innocent trust can be nurtured so that it will bloom into faith.   ""Honey, you are absolutely right. Let's run through the rain. If GOD let's us get wet, well maybe we just needed washing,"" Mom said.   Then off they ran. We all stood watching, smiling and laughing as they darted past the cars and yes, through the puddles. They held their shopping bags over their heads just in case. They got soaked. But they were followed by a few who screamed and laughed like children all the way to their cars.   And yes, I did. I ran. I got wet. I needed washing.   Circumstances or people can take away your material possessions, they can take away your money, and they can take away your health. But no one can ever take away your precious memories...So, don't forget to make time and take the opportunities to make memories everyday. To everything there is a season and a time to every purpose under heaven.   A friend sent this to me to remind me of life. Hope you enjoy it.   I HOPE YOU STILL TAKE THE TIME TO RUN THROUGH THE RAIN.   They say it takes a minute to find a special person, an hour to appreciate them, a day to love them, but then an entire life to forget them. Send this to the people you'll never forget. It's a short message to let them know that you'll never forget them.   Take the time to live!!!   Keep in touch with your friends, you never know when you'll need each other -- and don't forget to run in the rain!   God makes everything but unbreakable hearts"
11710,3295677,"07,July,2004",2004-07-07,"   I never dreamed slowly cruising on my motorcycle through a residential neighborhood could be so incredibly dangerous! Little did I suspect.    I was on Brice Street - a very nice neighborhood with perfect lawns and slow traffic. As I passed an oncoming car, a brown furry missile shot out from under it and tumbled to a stop immediately in front of me.    It was a squirrel, and must have been trying to run across the road when it encountered the car. I really was not going very fast, but there was no time to brake or avoid it -- it was that close. I hate to run over animals, and I really hate it on a motorcycle, but a squirrel should pose no danger to me.  I barely had time to brace for the impact.  Animal lovers, never fear. Squirrels, I discovered, can take care of themselves!     Inches before impact, the squirrel flipped to his feet. He was standing on his hind legs and facing my oncoming Valkyrie with steadfast resolve in his beady little eyes.  His mouth opened, and at the last possible second, he screamed and leapt!  I am pretty sure the scream was squirrel for, ""Bonzai!"" or maybe, ""Die you gravy-sucking, heathen scum!"" The leap was nothing short of spectacular...  He shot straight up, flew over my windshield, and impacted me squarely in the chest. Instantly, he set upon me. If I did not know better, I would have sworn he brought 20 of his little buddies along for the attack.    Snarling, hissing, and tearing at my clothes, he was a frenzy of activity. As I was dressed only in a light T-shirt, summer riding gloves, and jeans this was a bit of a cause for concern. This furry little tornado was doing some damage!  Picture a large man on a huge black and chrome cruiser, dressed in jeans, a T-shirt, and leather gloves, puttering at maybe 25 mph down a quiet residential street, and in the fight of his life with a squirrel.  And losing...  I grabbed for him with my left hand. After a few misses, I finally managed to snag his tail. With all my strength, I flung the evil rodent off to the left of the bike, almost running into the right curb as I recoiled from the throw. That should have done it. The matter should have ended right there.  It really should have. The squirrel could have sailed into one of the pristinely kept yards and gone on about his business, and I could have headed home. No one would have been the wiser. But this was no ordinary squirrel. This was not even an ordinary angry squirrel. This was an EVIL MUTANT ATTACK SQUIRREL OF DEATH!   Somehow he caught my gloved finger with one of his little hands and, with the force of the throw, swung around and with a resounding thump and an amazing impact, he landed squarely on my BACK and resumed his rather antisocial and extremely distracting activities. He also managed to take my left glove with him! The situation was not improved. Not improved at all.  His attacks were continuing, and now I could not reach him. I was startled, to say the least. The combination of the force of the throw, only having one hand (the throttle hand) on the handlebars, and my jerking back unfortunately put a healthy twist through my right hand and into the throttle. A healthy twist on the throttle of a Valkyrie can only have one result.    Torque.    This is what the Valkyrie is made for, and she is very, very good at it.    The engine roared and the front wheel left the pavement.    The squirrel screamed in anger.    The Valkyrie screamed in ecstasy.    I screamed in  .. well .. I just plain screamed.  Now picture a large man on a huge black and chrome cruiser, dressed in jeans, a slightly squirrel-torn t-shirt, wearing only one leather glove, and roaring at maybe 50 mph and rapidly accelerating down a quiet residential street on one wheel, with a demonic squirrel of death on his back.    The man and the squirrel are both screaming bloody murder.  With the sudden acceleration I was forced to put my other hand back on the handlebars and try to get control of the bike.  This was leaving the mutant squirrel to his own devices, but I really did not want to crash into somebody's tree, house, or parked car. Also, I had not yet figured out how to release the throttle... my brain was just simply overloaded. I did manage to mash the back brake, but it had little effect against the massive power of the big cruiser.  About this time the squirrel decided that I was not paying sufficient attention to this very serious battle (maybe he was an evil mutant NAZI attack squirrel of death), and he came around my neck and got INSIDE my full-face helmet with me.    As the faceplate closed part way, he began hissing in my face. I am quite sure my screaming changed intensity. It had little effect on the squirrel, however. The RPMs on the Dragon maxed out (since I was not bothering with shifting at the moment), so her front end started to drop.  Now picture a large man on a huge black and chrome cruiser, dressed in jeans, a very raggedly torn T-shirt, wearing only one leather glove, roaring at probably 80 mph, still on one wheel, with a large puffy squirrel's tail sticking out of the mostly closed full-face helmet. By now the screams are probably getting a little hoarse.  Finally I got the upper hand ... I managed to grab his tail again, pulled him out of my helmet, and slung him to the left as hard as I could. This time it worked ... sort-of.  Spectacularly sort-of ...so to speak.  Picture a new scene. You are a cop. You and your partner have pulled off on a quiet residential street and parked with your windows down to do some paperwork. Suddenly a large man on a huge black and chrome cruiser, dressed in jeans, a torn T-shirt flapping in the breeze, and wearing only one leather glove, moving at probably 80 mph on one wheel, and screaming bloody murder roars by, and with all his strength throws a live squirrel grenade directly into your police car.  I heard screams.  They weren't mine...  I managed to get the big motorcycle under control and dropped the front wheel to the ground. I then used maximum braking and skidded to a stop in a cloud of tire smoke at the stop sign of a busy cross street. I would have  returned to 'fess up (and to get my glove back). I really would have. Really... Except for two things.  First, the cops did not seem interested or the slightest bit concerned about me at the moment. When I looked back, the doors on both sides of the patrol car were flung wide open. The cop from the passenger side was on his back, doing a crab walk into somebody's front yard, quickly moving away from the car. The cop who had been in the driver's seat was standing in the street ...... aiming a riot shotgun at his own police car.  So, the cops were not interested in me. They often insist to ""let the professionals handle it"" anyway.  That was one thing. The other?  Well, I could clearly see shredded and flying pieces of foam and upholstery from the back seat. But I could also swear I saw the squirrel in the back window, shaking his little fist at me. That is one dangerous squirrel. And now he has a patrol car. A somewhat shredded patrol car ... but it was all his.  I took a deep breath, turned on my turn-signal, made a gentle right turn off of Brice Street, and sedately left the neighborhood. I decided it was best to just buy myself a new pair of gloves. And a whole lot of Band-Aids.  "
24603,3297517,"21,May,2004",2004-05-21,"   Well I have totally been flaking on my poor story this week...its my same issue with beginning it and then not getting past a few pages.  But I made myself write some more of it so I could remember that I really do enjoy making a story.  I think if I go too long without writing I kind of lose interest in it and stop caring about the characters..I just gotta force myself to write at least every few days so that when I get a nice big chunk of time I can maybe get a lot further into the story..the newest part of the story is at the bottom of this post.  Let's see what else...I got some BEAUTIFUL roses from my mom and sis for graduation.  Its been a long 10 years of part time school and work and a break in between but I finally have a bachelor's degree and I'm very very proud of myself for not giving up.  Tuesday was my last class.  I may go back in a couple years for a teaching credential but I don't know and right now I just really need to be done with school and start my real life!  AND I have an interview on Monday so *fingers crossed* hope it goes well!  I'm excited about it..and dammit I'll get my hopes up if I want to!    Finally Mindy began to speak again. ""Well you know I had that conference in Las Vegas...""  Of course he did.  Mindy was a real estate agent and she often went on business trips.  This last one was to the famous Sin City.  While he had been sure to warn her against staying up all night gambling and downing too many free drinks..even made a few jokes (or he had thought they were jokes at the time) about strippers.  Turns out it wasn't the strippers he needed to worry about...apparently what he should have been warning her against were sneaky ex-boyfriends.  Mindy continued to speak.  ""I never in a million years thought I would ever see Randall again..you know things didn't end on the best of terms.""  Heh yah he did..quite a few times he'd heard the heart-wrenching story of the man who broke Mindy's heart by not being willing to marry her three years ago.  Glancing at the white platinum band around Mindy's left ring finger, David tried again to swallow the idea that Randall obviously had a very big change of heart.  He raised one eyebrow, signaling Mindy to continue, fighting his instinct to run far, far away as fast as possible.  It was torture but he knew he needed to hear the entire story before he could ever hope to get past it.  "
24604,3297517,"15,May,2004",2004-05-15,"   I wanted to post the rest of what I've written so far..why I'm not sure but even if no one reads this I still enjoy posting it.  I like having my own journalish web page...hopefully in the next few days I can write about other stuff besidse my wanna be book.  But for now I'm just enjoying adding what I can to my story and hoping it's something I can continue to work at...  Anyway he was sure she was only asking because it was the expected thing to do.  Typical woman - break your heart one minute and the next she'll still try to mother you.    David shook himself out of his reverie and managed to focus on Mindy.  ""David?""  She looked at him beseechingly as if begging him to make this easy on her. While he wanted nothing more then to cut into her with biting sarcasm and express every ounce of the anger that was beginning to boil in his veins, he knew letting that demon loose right now would bring nothing but a guilty conscience later.  He took a deep breath and in a tightly controlled voice managed to ask ""How did this happen?""  Mindy's eyes dropped to the ground and she dug her toes into the ground like an errant schoolgirl. David crossed his arms over his chest and waited while she appeared to gather her thoughts.  After taking a deep breath, she raised her eyes to Davidâ€™s and blew her hair out of her face.  He had once found the trait endearing.  Now he saw it as a stalling method and just wanted to shake her into explaining herself.  David tapped his foot and continued to glare at Mindy, daring her to say something...anything...that would somehow make everything normal again.  He couldnâ€™t believe how much his life had changed in the last 15 minutes.  Just an hour ago, he had been dutifully writing out his guest list for their wedding and now..he could hardly stand to even think it...she had run off and eloped with someone else.  He couldnâ€™t even comprehend her betrayal, let alone be willing to accept whatever explanation she could possibly come up with.  "
24605,3297517,"13,May,2004",2004-05-13,   Okay!  So I've been asked to make the effort to actually write my book...I have a bad habit of starting but not following through with it.  I've read so many romance novels in my life that the style shouldn't be too hard for me to do..but coming up with a decent storyline is the hard part.  I figure for now I'll just keep writing and the story will kind of write itself?  Maybe?  And then I can add stuff in later.  I counted the number of words in a paperback and it seems to be about 200 words a page..unless there's like massive dialog (another big part of romance books i've noticed).  That means I'm about 1 1/4 pages into my book..lol only 300 or so more to go!  So here's the next part I've written...  He abruptly tuned back into the words that had torn his world apart just seconds ago.  â€œAnd tomorrow Iâ€™ll be by to get the rest of my stuffâ€¦and then me and Randall are off to the Caymans for our honeymoon.â€  His fianceeâ€™s..make that ex-fianceeâ€™sâ€¦ blue eyes were big in her pixie face.  It was what he had noticed first when his own dark eyes had passed over her face at his sisterâ€™s wedding.  Mindy had caught his attention when he glanced over the other guests and noticed those big blue eyes tearing up as his sister and her husband exchanged their vows.  Now those same eyes that had captivated him were watching him with remorse and a vague sense of desperation to be done with the conversation.  â€œDavid? Are you alright?â€  From some place far away David heard her but couldnâ€™t quite comprehend that she would even ask.   Maybe I'll write some more today..its kinda fun making up characters that can do whatever you want them to do.  If I can just get a bunch of pages done I'll feel I have no choice but to keep working on it.  Besides with all the changes that are about to happen in the next couple months I could really use the diversion!!  
24606,3297517,"11,May,2004",2004-05-11,"   My very first post...and I was just thinking about the book I've been reading and how boring it is..and how since I have a decent vocabulary, I should be able to write a romance book at least as interesting.  And then I can get published...of course I've never been able to write a story longer then a couple pages so a book might be a *bit* of a stretch..but why the hell not.  Everything in my life is gonna be craziness shortly..why not throw in writing a book too!    Okay here we go... What was that word..that one they used to describe when a man felt like every drop of testosterone had been drained from his body, when the woman he had planned to love forever castrated him with the blade of her deception, when every hope he had for the future slipped down the drain of infidelity..what was it again?  oh yah..emasculated...meaning to ""deprive of masculine vigor"".  It may have been since high school since he'd heard it but at this moment no other word was more fitting and it had stuck in his head because he was so sure it would never happen to him.  "
24607,3297517,"05,June,2004",2004-06-05,"   Oookay been a little while since I wrote in here but I'm back!  Yay I know you missed me!  ;)  So Memorial Day weekend was great.  I went down to San Luis Obispo County to visit my mom and sister, Kate, and one of my best friends, Jacqui, and it was such a great time!  Reminded me a little of what it's like to have a life...lol they're kinda fun! My sister's roommate put together a bbq the first night and had a few people over..we just drank beers and ate and had a good time.  Then on Monday Kate, her friend, and me and Jacqui went to the beach to lay out for a bit.  Jacqui and I left after a couple hours but when we got back into town found out her bf was going to play volleyball on the beach..so we headed back out and had Kate and her friend meet us and we played beach volleyball for the afternoon!  It was so much fun..though apparently beach volleyball is an excellent workout for your ass lol.  I was quite sore the next day!  Then I drove back up on Tuesday and the whole weekend was just perfect.  I couldn't have asked for a better time!  Alright now to see if I can continue on with my story....  Mindy took a few deep breaths, in through the nose and out through the mouth, as if gathering her strength.  He had seen her do it often enough in stressful situations and knew it was a tool she had picked up in one of her yoga classes.  Whenever life started to get overwhelming, Mindy would take a minute to ""center herself"".  David began tapping his foot in a rather fast tempo, perhaps hoping that the fast pace would quicken her centering so he could finish this conversation and get the hell out of there.  Finally she began speaking again.  ""Well it all happened so quickly..""  He'd say!  She left an engaged woman and came back three days later a married woman..just not to the man she had been engaged to when she left.  The irony was not lost on David.  ""I walked into the conference room and had just sat down when I heard someone call my name in a hushed tone.  I looked up and there was Randall...looking at me like I was an angel.""  David couldn't help the snort that escaped, but kept his mouth shut when she gave him a half exasperated half guilty look.  ""Obviously I know how much he broke my heart back then and trust me I was in no rush to forgive him.""  Mindy must've thought his snort was in reference to how quickly she changed her mind, and while that in itself was unbelievable, calling Mindy an angel was what had actually prompted his response.  Mindy was smart, beautiful...and could be kind of ruthless when she needed to be.  Angel was not the first word he would use to describe her....in fact she was probably closer to devilish.  But he let her continue.  ""He sat down next to me and would not leave until I would hear him out.  So I agreed to get coffee with him after the conference.  He told me that losing me was the biggest mistake he ever made but by the time he realized it, six months had passed and I was already in a relationship with you and he didn't feel it was his place to interfere.  He had even picked a ring out for me but was so worried that I would hate him more if he tried to break us up that he just kept it with him at all times and dreamed of the day that he could offer it to me.""  Alright thats all I've got for now..its kinda funny cuz I'll want to write more but then think I won't be able to come up with anything..but then when I start actually writing it just flows.  Let's hope that continues once I'm done with this intro conversation...moving into other situations will be interesting.  "
24608,3297517,"13,July,2004",2004-07-13,"   Forgot to add this latest part i wrote a little bit ago...things are busy right now..or are about to be anyway so i haven't been writing much. hopefully i'll get back into it later when things are all chill!  ""That day apparently coincided with your business trip?""  David heard the trace of suspicion coloring his voice and apparently Mindy heard it too.  She looked at him as if he had just suggested she had bought her clothes at Wal-Mart.  ""It wasn't planned David.  God dammit do you really think I've been lying to you all this time?""  At that moment her eyes started to fill with tears.  David watched in wonder as Mindy switched to the role he had watched her perform so many times for other people, but he had never had the opportunity to witness the magic, or in her case tragic,  transformation first hand.  He couldn't believe she was going to use the ""manipulation tears"", as he called them, on him!  She must really be desperate if she was resorting to that poor me act.  He'd watched her practice the look in front of the mirror before going to court for a speeding ticket or on her father when she needed to borrow some money..though that was long before she started making it big in real estate.  He even found himself wondering if the tears that had first captured his heart that he saw her shed at his sister's wedding had been fabricated as well.  He was beginning to feel as if he didn't know her at all.  ""Cut the bullshit Mindy!  You know I'm not gonna fall for that so let's just skip the little girl lost routine and finish this conversation.""  David pounded his fist on the counter next to him in frustration.  Though the physical release of pain made him feel momentarily better, the pulsing of his hand only served to mock him for losing control.  "
2758,3306195,"28,May,2004",2004-05-28,"    There's been travel and there's been rain, so there hasn't been much going on in the garden. However, Marny put together some great container plantings for the deck. They really spruce things up and, once it stops raining, I'll take pictures of them and post them.   Within the next week, I have to set up the second vegetable bed. I already put the wood frame together, just have to clear out the grass from the site and fill it with dirt and stuff (i.e. cow poop).   "
2759,3306195,"11,May,2004",2004-05-11,"    This seemed like a good day to start this blog. As I write this we are having a shed built at the end of our driveway. Today is the last day I'll have to lug all of my garden tools out of the basement every time I want to do some yard work.  Over the last month, Marny and I cleared out the site. Then I had a large pile of dirt delivered so I could even out the site and tamp it down. I finished fine tuning it this morning and now the shed is going up!  Eventually, that area will also feature a new bench/garden arbor, gravel covering the ground and container plantings. But, all of that will have to wait a little while. Next up is the vegetable garden. I'm doubling the size of last year's veggie garden and I need to start getting the new bed ready. My seedlings are starting to come up and will need to be replanted in a few weeks.   urlLink    the mess before...   urlLink    after clean up.   urlLink    the shed going up!   urlLink    All done! (Soon it will be painted white and blue, like the house)   "
2760,3306195,"05,June,2004",2004-06-05,"    Before I get into this new post, here's a picture of one of the beautiful containers Marny put together two weeks ago... We'll make a gardener out of her yet!   urlLink    nice, huh?  Since we moved in, there's been a big circle of sand in the backyard that used to house a pool. Early last summer I added a big pile (4 cubic feet) of loam to it, to be used for the vegetable garden. The intent was to then spread the rest of the loam out to fill in the sand circle, plant grass and have a nice lawn.   The pile of loam sat there until THIS summer, when we decided to add another vegetable bed and I had 4 MORE cubic feet of loam delivered.   Well, this past Sunday (May 30th), Marny and I put up the new veggie bed, spread out the loam and planted grass seed! The vegetable plants will go in tomorrow (weather permitting).  Here's a picture of the new and improved back yard...   urlLink    grass (and vegetables) coming soon   "
2761,3306195,"09,July,2004",2004-07-09,"    I'm feeling a little better about my To-Do list. I've got about 85% of it done (I obviously accomplished a lot since yesterday morning!), and still have all day Sunday to finish things up. Now, onto the things that have gotten done:  First of all, the shed is finished! I just put the finishing touches on it (marigolds in the window box and birdhouses hanging from each corner)   urlLink      Remember I mentioned that dilapidated storage bin/box that was falling apart and needed to be replaced? Here's a picture of what it used to look like:   urlLink      Yesterday I took a sledgehammer to it and three hours later it was broken up in bins for the trash. Unfortunately, they wouldn't take it! Regardless, I'm thrilled that it's been taken down:   urlLink    note all the remnants that the trash men would not take away. I have to lug it all to the dump myself! :(    Do you also remember the circle of sand that became the circle with piles of dirt that became the spread out dirt with grass seed? Well... it's a lawn now!   urlLink    the new lawn  Though I've still got a few things to do before my vacation is over, I'm feeling very good about what I've accomplished so far. Plus, I've learned a valuable lesson.  Things rarely take as long as you think they will.  I kept putting off the demolition of the wooden box near the driveway, dreading it and not wanting to do it. Well, it turns out that 3 hours with a sledgehammer (great for any pent up aggression you might have!) was all it took. I now know that I'm better off jumping right in and just doing it, rather than agonizing about it.   that's it for now. more to come early next week!   "
2762,3306195,"08,July,2004",2004-07-08,"    It's Thursday, my vacation is more than half over and I've only gotten about a third of my To-Do list done.  uh-oh....  more to come!   "
2763,3306195,"04,July,2004",2004-07-04,"    Marny and I have been VERY busy in the yard and we've accomplished a lot. I'm on vacation this coming week, so even more will get done. We're putting the finishing touches on the shed tomorrow so we'll have pictures up soon.  I've made up a to-do list for my vacation (don't get me wrong, I LOVE working in the yard, so spending a whole week doing that  is  a vacation for me). Here's the list of what I hope to accomplish:  -Finish painting shed/re-attach shutters and window box  -Demolish wooden ""box"" near driveway (a ramshackle storage bin that needs to go!)  -clean grill and replace briquets (which are coated with grease)  -install drip watering system in vegetable garden  -trim back trees along back of yard  -Put down landscape fabric and new mulch in front beds.  -install edging around front beds  -put up new mailbox (long story involving an ""unknown"" car that ran over our old mailbox - we know who did it, but he won't admit it)  -have Thai dinner with lovely wife (Marny's contribution to my To-Do list!)   It seems like a long list, but once I get into a groove I can get a lot done. I'll check in at the end of the week to let you know how I did and show off some pictures.  Happy Fourth everyone!   "
2764,3306195,"01,August,2004",2004-08-01,"    On Friday, Jeannette and I went to Tranquil Lake Nursery in nearby Rehobeth MA. Lots of back roads to get there, but it was well worth it! I picked up three new plants including a Yarrow, a Golden Curls Willow:   urlLink     and a Butterfly Bush. Within in ten minutes of planting the Butterfly Bush, we had our first butterfly on it!   urlLink      I finally got around to putting the lattice up around the bottom of the shed, giving it a truly finished look. Now I have to landscape around it. One thing at a time!   "

But not really like i have a life. hahah obviously not if im sitting here at 12 19 am and on a friday night. I hate my life. all my other COOl friends are probably hooking up in bars. im sitting here just counting the cars. not that cars come down my road very much but if they did i would probably go count them. but instead im sitting here""on the couch"" watching the the south park reflection on my dave matthews poster. bored off my ass. but high so. its ok. im thinking about watching my Ryan Adams DVD..he is the greatest man...besides ive seen the episode of south park already...not exactly fun...nothing much is very funny these days ..not really sure why..i have grown accustomed to being depressed..which isnt a good sign...but it gets old just putting on this mask thinking everything is ok. but deep down you really want to do is scream your head off...am i practicing good self control or is it that i am slowly hurting myself until i cant fall anymore and lash out irrationaly at the closest person near me at the time of 15 yrs of aggression, resentment, hostility come out..God I hope not. better off to keep it to myself..because most of the time its me at fault not anyone else and it sucks...im tired of being at fault..or thinking im at fault..and even when im probably not at fault i feel like i am because of been raised by a person which did no wrong and I was always at fault no matter what. im 24 yrs old and im still always at fault. on a brighter note Ryan Adams is the greatest.   Go on little girl feet twirl, go and make him smile, go on like the rumbling drums in the march of time and when the father meets the dad it was be something better for the pain. But you will always be the same  --Ryan Adams  Tomorrow is another day Hopefully it wont end this way Im tired of being alone and sad and having to pretend i am glad  Maybe one day it will be a diferrent way I dont know hopefully soon Kind of like a butterfly coming out of a cocoon Pretty as can be One day that will be me.

1666,3307733,"11,May,2004",2004-05-11,"   Cyndi is gone for a week in the Bahamas so I'm doing her job as well as mine. The dynamics of the office are a lot different without her around and while it's stressful in someways, it's better in others. I am doing the work she does, but doing it right and trying (albeit only moderately successfully) to not panic when I have so much on my plate. She's leaving in June for a career change since she just graduated and although I'm looking forward to it, I'm also kind of freaked out about it. That means a new person to train, and I think I'll be the one doing some of the training.   Office politics are also interesting. It seems that everyone has a beef with everyone else on some day during the week. I'm just generally bitchy, though I don't mean to be. I'm bringing my day to day life with me to work and I need to stop doing that. Stress in life needs to be seperate from stress at work. That way it won't compound things. Today I started out with a nasty attitude...but talked with Mary and felt better immediately. Tomorrow there's some sort of meeting at 8:30 for the whole company. It seems that we're having a change in the way that insurance is being taken out of our checks. Pre tax instead of Post tax I think. In other news, there should be raises coming, if what I percieve is correct. Hopefully that's just a boon to me with another raise on top of that for a change in position.   Boring stuff..but it's my life.   Went out to take care of Erik tonight and he read a book to me. That was a wonderful thing to hear. :) I'm so proud of this little boy. He's working so hard at school and is struggling through the desire for independence and the need for his parents. At the tender age of 7 he's already been through so much. I hope to make his life a little easier in the years to come.   "

1673,3307733,"05,July,2004",2004-07-05,"   I remember dreaming about sitting in a swing as a very young girl. It was the fall and my father was pushing me back and forth, back and forth. I remember being happy to be with him.   Now, as I sit here at age 26, I feel that I will never have another happy dream about my father. I will no longer have happy memories of him. There aren't too many to remember anyway.   There was a day when I was 4 years old, sitting on the couch and crying as I watched my father take his suitcase and walk out the door of our home. When I was young, I wanted nothing more than his approval and his love and I suppose things haven't changed much in that way. I would still like his approval and love. I'm not going to get it.   This week we exchanged e-mails. They were nasty and hateful. I haven't seen him for years...hadn't spoken to him in over 3 years. He's lived in Arizona since I was seven years old and I have never seen him much.   I sent an e-mail out to everyone on my list and ended up sending it to him. There was a question asking who would be least likely to respond and I put he and my stepmother. A few days later, I recieved a response criticizing me for that comment. I was speaking nothing but the truth and thought it would be glossed over. Apparently emotions are raw in that household and I struck a nerve.  Over the course of two days, he called me names, told me I was just like my mother ( the biggest insult he can weild) and told me I shirked my responsibilities. He said I was still angry with him about not giving me money at a time when I needed it. If I hadn't been desperate, I never would have asked. He said that he needed to help my step-sister with the purchase of a house and I said as much and said I understood. He wrote back stating that she had never needed their help and took nothing from them, so I should leave her the hell out of it. Caught in a lie apparently. I left my boyfriend and left him with custody of our son because I couldn't have handled being a single parent. My son would not have been in a good environment. My ex and I both new that and instead of going through the courts for a nasty battle, I conceded and left my son with him. My father did the same when he left my mother and apparently holds anger and guilt over that situation. He acts as though it was an easy decision for me. Acts as though I just left and went galavanting off on a childless vacation. In reality, I left and started to rebuild my life and myself.   Now my son's father and I are closer than ever and we all have a wonderful relationship. Given the circumstances, that's the best thing that could have come out of everything.   Anyhow, nasty things said by both sides.   I decided to have no further contact with him last week. Ever. Maybe when I'm older that will change. But for now, he and I are both too stubborn to apologize. He hasn't been a father to me for years and I can't say that anything much has changed. Only the reality that he's the man I had always heard about and had always hoped everyone was wrong about. I still can't believe he acted in the way he did.   He attacked my aunt as well. My closest friend and ally in the family. Apparently he thinks I've been poisoned against him. The two of them have had a fairly long standing feud. He said to me that family is the most important thing to him. When his parents are pissed at him, his sisters will no longer speak to him and he attacks his only biological child.   I've never seen a father act in this way toward a child.   Now, all of this is my perception. A one-sided arguement, I guess. I will not post e-mails here because they are simply too much to handle at this point. I want to sweep it all under the rug and forget about it. I haven't needed him for years and will continue to get along without him. It's the finality of the decision. I had always hoped he and I could be close. Apparently that's not going to be the case.   Could I have done something different? Probably. But I'm not the parent here. I'm his daughter. I shouldn't have to clamor for the approval of an apparition. If he had wanted a relationship with me for the last few years, if he could have seen past whatever anger he held toward me, if things could have been worked out enough in his head to have a conversation with me....then maybe the situation would have been different.   I have an ex stepfather whom I have called ""dad"" since I was fairly young. He's the one who was there and continues to be. I have a stepfather now who would take care of me if push came to shove. I have a great family with lots of loving support. It took me until last week to realize what a support network I have. Randy (the bio father) seems to be the only one who doesn't want to be a part of it. He wants to get to know his grandson, that's evident. But he will not get to know my son until he gets to know me.   I've already checked out the legal issues governing grandparental rights and have found out that he doesn't have any rights. He hasn't seen Erik, hasn't contacted him and it's not like he's been seeing him since he was an infant. So, that's that. If they want to take it to court, then so be it. I wouldn't put it past them.   Anyhow, that has been the main part of my week.   Happy Fourth of July to me.   "
18605,3308014,"12,May,2004",2004-05-12,"    I hope the lackluster buildup doesn't cause this post to be a disappointment.  Many years ago the 3 surgical hospitals/campuses in my city were overhauled by some team of somebodies.  The somebodies decided there was no need for services to be duplicated at sites as this caused a need for 2 (or 3) sets of staff and equipment to be supplied.  They came up with a game plan of which site would absorb some services, and give up other services, and then they came up with a time line (milestones) of when all the changes would take place.  Since then, building and renovation have been taking place, and they are finally beginning to switch around services.  My hospital is going to become an ambulatory centre, focusing on cataract/eye surgery, urology surgery, and hand and upper limb surgery, with small contingents of general, gyn, ent and ortho thrown in for good measure.  When the teams/powers that be looked at what was transferring, they took into account the amount of work that was being sent, the number of people hours it would take to make that work amount function, and then they broke it down into specific job lines (ie. 8 full time RNs, 2 part time RNs, 1 Attendant, etc).  When a program transfers, those job lines have the ""opportunity"" to transfer with the program, since many nurses and other health care workers have specialized in that program over the years, and may not wish to stay in a hospital which will no longer be providing care in their area of expertise.  In November I was told that an attendant with the ophthalmology program wanted to transfer to my site, and he had more seniority than I.  Despite working in the OR for 17 years, I was the least senior in my department, so I was becoming ""redundant"".  They outlined all my options, but I wasn't given official notice because the transfer date had been pushed back.  According to Union contract, they had to give me 4 months notice (and only 4 months) and they were not going to give me one day more.  I looked at my options.  1. Accept a buy out package, return to school, and get reimbursed up to $5000 for any tuition paid out in the first year.  This left me with a lump sum (which would prevent me from collecting unemployment until it ran out), and the knowledge that unemployment would only let me attend school for 1 year, if it lead to a job within one year.  Therefore, university was out, and any college program more than 1 year long was out.  2. Exercise my bumping rights and move to the job of the least senior full time person in my job category.  I spoke to several people familiar with work in the unit that person was in, and knew I would hate switching to that job.  3. Apply for any job postings which came up in the meantime, and get one of those.  I went to a few unemployment workshops, to learn about the aide available from them.  I spoke to college and university counselors, and I seriously considered becoming a pharmacy technician, while attending a private medical school and retaining part-time employment, therefore keeping my seniority.  I would have to pay for the schooling myself, but the job would be in my current union, so I would have 17 years seniority in applying for any pharm tech jobs in the hospital, and therefore job security.  I went to the private school, and they had me take a multiple choice aptitude test before the interview.  The interviewer then did his job too well.  He told me I had the best score he had ever seen, and he raved over my transcript marks.  Shortly thereafter I was conversing with a co-worker who was just about finished her BA of Ed, after returning to school in her early 40's.  When I was younger I wanted to be a teacher, but I got sidetracked.  My conversation with her, my circumstances, and the interviewers remarks all led me to decide I was going to go to university and become a teacher.  Surprisingly, my husband agreed.  He was more supportive of my longer and more expensive schooling than he was of my short-term pharm tech program.  I applied for a part-time job in the Central Processing department, and 1 week before the deadline the hospital had in which to give me notice, they called and said I was the successful applicant.  I accepted, and so my other options never came to pass.  Now I am set on a very exciting course, but I'm very frustrated that the university has not yet accepted me!  Grrrrrrrr  And that was my restructuring story  Cheers Jay-A   "
18606,3308014,"11,May,2004",2004-05-11,"    You're still not getting the ""restructuring"" story, because I need to vent.  I applied for University in March.  I can check the website with my own ""special and private"" id to see the status of my application.  The site says they received it at the end of March, and that it should take 2-4 weeks before they offer me admission (or say neener neener, NO!)  I just spent over 20 minutes waiting for ""the next available operator"", and He Said:  ""We received it in the beginning of April, it was processed by April 14th, in 2 days it will be 4 weeks"" (No, in 2 days it will be 1 month, today is 4 weeks, kid), and ""it's a really busy time of year.""  They may have it processed within another 2 weeks.  GRRRRRRRRR  I changed my life for this opportunity, and the University counseller that I went to see (twice) told me  ""Historically, we have never turned down a qualified mature applicant for part-time studies, and Jay-A"",  , ""you are a qualified mature applicant for part-time studies.""  So basically, she gave me the best assurance she could without getting her butt into a legal bind if by some chance I didn't make it.  I know that MOST LIKELY I'll be accepted, but I don't like most likely, I want I AM ACCEPTED.  Grrrrrrrr, Arrrrrrrrg  Out of all the choices I was given regarding my restructuring out of my job, I took the reins of control and MADE this choice an option, and threw all my other options out the window when I did so.  If I don't get accepted to University  a)  I'll be hugely embarressed, because everyone thinks I'm going  (over 100 nurses, surgeons and anaesthetists in my current department, plus other hospital employees, my husband's family, my family, etc, etc)  b)  I'm stuck taking the part-time job I begin at the end of this month.  Sure I get full-time training for the summer, and sure they are short staffed and I can probably work full-time hours even past that, but I don't care!  I want to be a student.  Grrrrrrrrr, Arrrrrrrrrg, Growl!  I'm still not completely vented, but I don't know what else to say, and it is time to head out of town to my second session of the course I need to take for my new job.  sigh  Jay-A   "

I'm thrilled about heading to University in the fall, and in order to implement this opportunity, I have applied for and taken a new job within the hospital that I work at, and I begin this new job on the last day of May.  I've spent the last 17 years working as an OR Attendant (muscular nurse's aide with only on the job training - no courses), and I shall now be seeing things a bit differently as I wash, package and sterilize the surgical and respiratory equipment used throughout the hospital.  Fortunately, the OR and the Central Processing departments work very closely together, so I know the majority of my new co-workers, and I'll still see my old co-workers daily.  My next post shall concern the reasons (city-wide hospital restructuring) that have led to my life-altering choices.  Cheers! Jay-A   "

With its two screens, Nintendo DS instantly shows its innovative face. But capabilities like a touch-screen input, voice recognition and wireless communication set it apart from every other game device, and again demonstrate Nintendoâ€™s passion for groundbreaking originality.  Game players need only use their imagination to see how the DS promises to transform the portable game industry by changing the way gamers relate to their games â€“ and each other. Two screens offer two perspectives on the action at once. The touch screen could make accessing items, moving characters or navigating menus as easy as a tap or drag on the screen. Voice recognition could let players simply tell the game what they want it to do. Chat software will let users transmit text messages, handwriting and even drawings to one another. And wireless functions could link players in the same room â€“ or across the country. The unique features of the Nintendo DS hold a wellspring of potential for the future. Game players will be wowed.   Check it out for yourself  at http://www.nintendo.com/e3_2004/ds/index.jsp It's incredible! And heres a comment from the President of Square-Enix (Creators of Final Fantasy!)   â€œI believe that Square Enix has a promising chance in the platform, since Nintendo DS allows users to experience whole new game play with both its input system and its output system.â€ â€“ Yoichi Wada, president and representative director, Square Enix  Damn this is gonna dent my wallet ^^;   "

18590,3309541,"26,May,2004",2004-05-26,"   Ok, Now we've done it.  NE Florida has finally followed much of the nation and gone past $2.00(US) per gallon.  Someone told me it's expected to go to $3.00 by the end of the summer (unless the gas companies stop their extortion).  My theory is:  Per year, bring the price up to a new high, bring it down (but not nearly as low as before) when everyone finally screams loud enough, then the following year go to a newer high.  And so on....  this way they get the pricing/profits up incrementally.  All while blaming OPEC.  "
18591,3309541,"11,May,2004",2004-05-11,"   I just heard on a news story that documentary evidence has been obtained that oil refineries are artificially inflating the prices at the pump.  The oil barons  claim  the war and OPEC are to blaim but as the report I saw showed, they are merely hiking up the profit margins.  While am an advocate of the free market system that's supposed to balance supply with demand and price, this is obviously a case of abuse of the system.  The oil companies have us over a barrel (pun intended) as the ability for americans to conserve gas by using less pretty much only works for those chosing to drive during their vacation (OK so the American penchant for bigger vehicles could be curbed, but for those of us with a large family, that's not an option).  The real problem is that as gas prices rise, all prices rise to pass on the cost of transportation to market. I think it's pretty sick that oil companies are willing to sacrifice a long term economic recovery for short term gains in their profits.  Eventually, the higher prices at the pump will even affect the oil barons for every thing they purchase will cost more.  Eating away at any gains their bank accounts might've had.  My $.02 (or drop of gas).  "

18593,3309541,"11,June,2004",2004-06-11,"   Ok, so I'm on vacation with my family and kids in the mega-suv and was passing through southern Tennessee today (Did I mention this was a major road trip?), and we are suddenly stopped on the freeway (as in parking lot).  We're about 4 miles from the last exit and can't turn around to go another way if we wanted to.  Anyway, we start to look around at the others in our unfortunate position and besides the truckers, we seem to be in the middle of  a college bash.  I mean people from all different states and walks of life.  So we're thinking ""What's up with this?"", are we near a college town or what?  It's not long before we notice a car with ""Bonnoroo or Bust"".  So what's Bonnoroo?  There's several thousand cars in this line with us and it's starting to give us the impression of some sort of WoodStock revival.  Well, come to find out  , sheesh that's what it is.  We've been so out of touch I guess that we've never heard of this.    Oh well, had to go online at the hotel to find out what it was that kept us over an hour and a half off our schedule.  Sounded pretty interesting if I were 10 yrs younger or maybe more plugged in to the latest music stuff.  But I've got to say that one of the reasons I'm not plugged in to the latest would be that I can't find anything I like.  It seems to be either too commercial (aka Brittany/Boy Band), or too bizzare/angry/bitter/sappy.  But I guess most of it isn't even my interests.    Most of what I listen to is either Christian based, or instrumental.  Not what you'd call ""main-stream"".  Oh well.  I think it'd be interesting to attend Bonnoroo or something like it, or at least to hear some of the stuff played there just to get a clue of what's out there to form an honest opinion.  I imagine that some of those bands are truly trying to make a statement or difference and are not tied in to a corporate entity.  By the way, did I mention that a Yukon costs over $55 to fill at todays prices?  I was the celebrity at the pump.  The folks around me were amazed.  If you see us on the road, wave.

5164,3311843,"12,May,2004",2004-05-12,"   I went over to my brother's yesterday evening to give him a demo of Knoppix. It was a CD which I got with my Dutch magazine PC-Active. The version is 3.3 His impression before putting the CD in was that Linux was overall much to difficult to learn, after all, he'd been using Windows since he has a PC - which is a fair few years now. When the KDE desktop appeared with working sound his face simply lit up. He didn't have to say anything, I could hear him think ""wow!"". We had a look through the main menu-structure and just ran a few programs - Mozilla, KMail, KStars, the Control Centre. He was simply impressed. I have to say, even from the CD, Knoppix is fast and reliable. He's now going to play around with the CD for a while and will probably get more enthousiastic as time goes by. In a couple of weeks (days?), I expect a request to make him a permament install on his hard-drive. He had just had a lot of virus-related problems and his windows-box had grind to a halt a couple of days ago. He was very interested in learning that with this operating system, no more of that would happen. He was also worried he wouldn't be able to do the things in Linux he did under Windows, but after showing him OpenOffice.org, this was no longer an issue.  Oh, by the way, there is a new version of Knoppix, 3.4 - read all about it on the  urlLink Knoppix website  "

I don't make enough money to help pay the rent and stuff so he basically threw it in my face.  Needless to say, I ended up crying and telling him if he didn't like it, then he knew where the door was.  So he threatened to watch what I say.  This made me even more upset.  So that's how he left for work; pissed off at me.  I'm not really happy today.  I also have a injured foot.  I think its an ingrown toe-nail and it hurts like a mother!  I went to call into work today bc I can't stand for long periods of time and I waas told I had no choice but to come in.  My shift got changed from 12-6 to 3-6.  So I made a doctor's appointment to get my foot check out at 11:20.  I just recieved a phone call from the assist. manager saying I  had  to come in at 12 - that the cover from 12-3 had to work at her other store.  I told her I couldn't come in bc I had a doctor's appointment and she sighed and was like, ""fine, 3 then.""  And then hung up on me!!  I swear, I want to quit so bad.  I have someone working on getting me a job at her office so I hope that goes through.  I need to get out of Dunkies.  They treat people like shit.  But anyways...I promised I'd upload some pictures.

But it doesn't.  It feels like everything that we've been through is new again.  It's not bad though.  I'm really happy.  But our honeymoon could've been better...  Our wedding day was just as any young girl would picture it, no clouds in the sky, clear blue skys, nice and hot (well...nice and warm).  The perfect wedding day.  We have some nice pictures which I'm gonna have to upload somewhere.  Our honeymoon was on a cruise to Bermuda.  There wasn't much for us on the way to and from for us, but we managed by sticking ourselves in our stateroom the whole time, lol.  We did go to the casino a few times - spent a $150.  Bermuda was beautiful.  Hot and wonderful.  Clear waters, nice people.  I'll write more later.  I have many errands to run to get re-settled into my home.   "

We got engaged a month and a half ago and pulled everything together for tomorrow.  It still amazes me how well we did.  But, we did freak out this morning about the cake.  We never heard from her, so we thought she forgot about us.  I called her this morning and everything's on track and I'm going over there at 2 to make my payment on it.  There is still so much more to do, it feels, but everything is right about done.  I just have to stop over my mother's to get the DJ's # so I can call them and see what's up.  They need some songs from me.  Overall, I think I better log off because I have to run to the bank, go all the way to Brockton to pick up my Maid of Honor (she doesn't drive), go back home to meet my cousin, go out to lunch with my family, go pay for the cake, go to the spa to get pampered with Christina (the MOH), and then go to my mom's house to get some sleep.

13313,3320342,"15,July,2004",2004-07-15,"   Here it is...chapter 1.  Remember to comment with feedback when you're done.  Thank you.   &&&    Chapter 1   My body jumped as the familiar buzzing in my purse made me grab my cell phone subconsciously.  I held the phone in front of my face and my fingers began to push random buttons.  I had a text message.  I opened the text messaging folder and gasped at what the snippet line read.  I couldnâ€™t be.  I opened the message and finished reading the short sentence present on the screen.   I want to see you again . How could I let this happen?  How could I have even considered what I was doing?  It wasnâ€™t like I was single either.  I was a happily married woman.  I loved my husband more than anyone could ever know.  To any normal person, what I was doing was officially wrong, a sin even.  Under the eyes of God I was in a binded relationship that couldnâ€™t be broken without serious paperwork involved.  Yet I had another man text massaging me, calling my cell phone when he found free time, even emailing me. I know it sounds strange to anyone that doesnâ€™t know the whole story.  If Iâ€™m  so  in love with my husband then where did I find the time to meet someone else?  And why did I even attempt to?  But itâ€™s not like that, I swear.  I met him at a Hanson concert a few months ago.  And since then, my life has totally changed.   ------    â€œHoney, my mother bought me tickets to see Hanson,â€ I said excitedly.  â€œThe tickets should be here in a few weeks.â€ â€œGood for you,â€ he said with the roll of his eyes. 	Kyle knew how much I loved Hanson.  I made it very clear to him that he was not to try to change my love for the guys.  And I wouldnâ€™t change his love for sports. â€œAt least now this balances out with you going to New York in October,â€ I said.  â€œNow I have something special to look forward to.â€ 	I had been a fan of Hanson since the â€œMMMBop days.â€  My favorite Hanson was like every other girl on the planet; Taylor.  But when young Zac went through puberty, grew taller, and grew more manly, my feelings changed.  For awhile, before my desire for Zac, I thought Isaac was pretty hot; but he just never stuck to me the way the other two did. Alas, it had been my dream to meet the guys and tell them how much their lives as celebrities had helped me surpass so many obstacles over the years.  Two months before I went to my first concert in June of 1998, my grandfather passed away to cancer.  At the concert they sang â€œWith You in Your Dreamsâ€ in which I had a difficult time getting through.  I felt the boys love for their fans that night.  It made me respect them even more than I already did.  That night made me believe they truly meant it when they said they cherished their fans. The one thing I always wanted to do was to meet them; to try to convey my gratitude to them being one of the biggest supports in my life.  I sometimes wonder if that is why Iâ€™m still a fan today; if Iâ€™m trying to hold onto the past.  But I donâ€™t believe it because I know my love for them is as real as their love for me is. â€œWhen is the concert?â€ Kyle asks, glancing away from the baseball game that blares from our TV. â€œItâ€™s the day before your birthday.  The twentieth,â€ I said.  He says nothing and turns back to his game. 	I roll my eyes and wonder how I can love this man so much.  I met Kyle three years ago in January of 2001.  His younger sister had offered to hook us up and I agreed; just to see what he was like.  Two days later we became an official couple.  He is Italian, and you can definitely tell it when you visit his grandparentsâ€™ house.  I knew the night I met him that he would become my husband someday.  It was something my mother had always told me, â€œYouâ€™ll just know,â€ she would say.  I never understood until Kyle stepped into my life. 	He was different, and he was definitely not a child.  He had morals, values, and wanted to be taken seriously; yet he wanted to have fun while doing it.  And he isnâ€™t bad looking either.  Standing 6â€™2â€ with brown hair buzzed neatly to his head and eyes blue of that of an ocean in New England, heâ€™s something to look at.  Iâ€™m surprised when he choose me as his companion.  Compared to my short 4â€™11â€ frame, people must think we make an odd couple.  But we love each other, and I guess thatâ€™s all that matters. 	Ever since our relationship started, I knew it wasnâ€™t going to be like my past relationships.  Kyle moved in with my mother and me only three months into our relationship.  Three years later, this past March, I decided I didnâ€™t want to live with my mother anymore.  Kyle had been itching to move, but I knew I couldnâ€™t afford it.  But something inside me snapped, and I wanted to make it work.  I wanted to know what it was like to be on my own.  For Christ sakes, I turned twenty-three a month prior. 	Kyle and I applied to an apartment complex down the street from my motherâ€™s condo.  We got approved for the apartment three days later.  Because of the move, my health insurance would be canceled since I wouldnâ€™t be living at home anymore.  At the end of March Kyle and I mutually decided to get married so I could fall on his insurance.  We had two dates in mind.  May 8th or May 15th.  I was leaning more towards May 8th because it wouldâ€™ve been two years and one month after Taylor Hanson and his wife Natalieâ€™s wedding date.  But that date wasnâ€™t happening; it was Motherâ€™s Day weekend.  After a week of debating, May 15, 2004 was the date etched in stone that was to be when I would become a wife. 	Though there wasnâ€™t a proper proposal, I didnâ€™t really care.  All that mattered was Kyle and me.  On the weekend of April 2nd, I traveled to Maine with my father to visit my family there and to start picking out wedding gowns.  When I returned home my father handed us $60 to go out to dinner and left us bewildered.  So we went to dinner at a nice little Italian place up the street, came home and changed into our scrubs, and began watching baseball.  During a commercial, Kyle stood from his lazy sitting position on the arm chair and started a little speech. â€œAs you know, weâ€™re getting married,â€ he started off.  â€œAnd as you know, there is something that hasnâ€™t been done yet.  I have something I want to give to you that belongs to your family.  They wanted you to have it.â€ 	He continued with saying that it was an heirloom passed down to my fatherâ€™s older sister.  After he finished talking, he grabbed my hand and stood me in front of him.  Taking a deep breath, he said â€œI already know the answer, but itâ€™s nice to hear it anyway.â€  I could tell he was shaking as he got down on one knee and looked into my eyes as he asked, â€œWill you marry me?â€ in a childish tone, the â€œKyle toneâ€ as the game came back on in the background. 	Now I was shocked.  I had wanted for two years to have those words uttered from his lips.  I never thought this moment would happen.  And it couldnâ€™t have been more perfect.  It was how I dreamed of it with Kyle; some sort of sport happening in the background.  It was just the way it was meant to be, and it was nothing sort of what I expected. â€œYes,â€ I said as he prepared the ring for me.  I removed the rings I had already on my finger; an opal he gave to me our first Christmas together, and a tiny heart shaped ring with an amethyst (my birthstone) in the center.  I set them aside as he took the tiny diamond from its case and took my left hand in his hand.  The ring fit perfectly.  That night I called everyone in my family.  It was then that our unity was official.  It was really going to happen.   -------    	I re-read the message on my screen.  I wanted to see him too.  I didnâ€™t even know he was in town.  But something was holding me back to reply to him.  I couldnâ€™t do it to my husband.  But I wanted to. 	It had been a few months since I last saw him, at that concert in July.  It was now October, and the air around me grew chilly as I thought of what to write back.  Finally I settled on  I want to see you too .  I closed my eyes and bit my lip as my finger hit â€˜send.â€™ 	 What are you doing?   I silently scolded myself.  Then a thought hit me suddenly.  Did I really love my husband or had he always been a sort of backup plan? "

13083,3324571,"12,May,2004",2004-05-12,"   The antipathy I feel for George W.Bush is consuming me.  It simply amazes me that anyone would support such a horrible and inept president.  What really baffles me are the people who vote against their own economic interests i.e. working class people who definitely do not make 200,000 dollars a year.  A typical example of this type of person is my sister in law.  Her husband makes about 30,000 dollars working for the post office in NYC.  They have to live way outside the city because they couldn't possibly afford to live near the city with what he makes.  They have lousy insurance coverage, they have to shop at thrift shops, they never go anywhere because they are so strapped....Yet they vote for George Bush.  Do they really think George W. Bush, a man that was raised with servants and mansions cares about them?  I once tried to tell them that Bush never even owned a ranch until Carl Rove made him buy one right before the 2000 election to make him look like a ""regular guy"".  People like my brother and sister in law are hopeless cases, they will vote for ""W"" no matter what because the only news they watch is Fox News, the official mouthpiece of the Bush banana Republic.   I believe history is not going to be very kind to George.  What kind of legacy will he leave?  Under his leadership the worst terrorist attack  this country has ever seen occurred(he ignored the warnings and consequently 3000 people died)  he cut taxes for the ultra wealthy, he cut funding for education, he destroyed our international reputation by pre-emptively going to war in Iraq on manufactured evidence, the armed forces under his command has been torturing and raping Iraqis, the list goes on and on, and I am going to breathe one huge sigh of relief when this jerk is voted out of office, that is of course if the elections aren't rigged by Diebold.

So far, it's quite nice - it's a web-based app that you could run on your website if you so desired... or, even nicer given Mac OS X's built-in Apache webserver (and if you add PHP and MySQL to that... a relatively simple thing) it'll run locally.  It's tree-based so you can add top level items (ie. for various projects) and then add various sub-tasks (and sub-sub tasks) as necessary.  Everything that you'd look for in a task manager is included, along with some nice extras such as iCal integration - it will publish any tasks with due dates to an iCal compatible format that you can subscribe to in iCal.  Set it as your startup page in the browser of your choice (excepting of course IE, which I wish people would just stop using already) and voila! Instant organization... or at least the semblance of it accompanied by a minor sense of accomplishment at having installed your first PHP app locally...  "
30328,3324842,"24,May,2004",2004-05-24,"   I began this weekend energetic and freshly shaven.  I ended this weekend exhausted and muddy.  Thank goodness that I got a newly planted garden out of the deal or else it would've been a real downer.  Before:   urlLink     After:    urlLink     urlLink     urlLink     Most of this went in on Saturday, great amounts of digging (by me), shopping for flowers (by Kerrie), wheel-barrowing (by me), laying of topsoil (by Kerrie), and planting (by both of us) rendered us completely done in by about seven o'clock.  So, we decided to leave the rest of the planting and carting away of removed sod until Sunday morning.  Now, you would think that after a hard day's work, we would sleep like babes and not wake until morning.  Unfortunately, mother nature decided to throw a complete wobbler during the middle of the night and with the lightning, the thunder and the torrents of rain, kept us up for a good while.  Not that we're afraid of a little thunder (well, at least that's not the issue I'm addressing here...) but rather we were afraid for our partially planted garden.  Our fears turned out to be well founded and Sunday morning found us back at Lowe's picking up enough topsoil to replace all that had been washed away during the middle of the night... which is to say: all of it.  But, laments aside, we got it done, put on the mulch and congratulated ourselves heartily before retiring to the sofa and to X-Men 2, which, to conclude, is a damn fine flick.  "

30331,3324842,"17,May,2004",2004-05-17,"   I'll preface this link by saying that I've never actually played an online role-playing game and have never really had the inclination.  However, after reading   urlLink My Tiny Life   a few years ago, I can't help but be interested in the whole notion of a virtual world as a social and economic structure.  As the author of the article mentions, virtual worlds offer a significant advantage over the real world for studying social and economic phenomena, namely that all of its inhabitants start at the same station in life: ""Level 1"":   ...EverQuest, the world's first truly egalitarian polity. Everyone begins the same way: with nothing. You enter with pathetic skills, no money, and only the clothes on your back. Wealth comes from working hard, honing your skills, and clever trading. It is a genuine meritocracy, which is precisely why players love the game, Castronova argues. ""It undoes all the inequities in society. They're wiped away. Sir Thomas More would have dreamt about that possibility, that kind of utopia,"" he says.   So, now that you've swallowed the utopian nature of EverQuest, apparently, it's also the worlds 77th richest country, outdoing China and India.  Interested yet?

30332,3324842,"12,May,2004",2004-05-12,"   Well, here it is... I've finally succumbed and decided to try blogging.  I suppose in a way I feel that I have to at least give the thing a  try .  &lt;whining&gt;Everyone's doing it, you know you wanna&lt;/whining&gt;: so there it is and here we are.  So, what's it about?  Essentially, despite residing on my business's site (samedis.com), I plan on using this primarily for my own personal interests.  Since my philosophy with Samedis Design is that I hope to bring a personal relationship to my clients and to make translating their ideas to the web easy, there's not necessarily a distinction between who I am and how my business operates.  That means that if clients would like to find out a little more about me and thus Samedis Design, this will be available.  However, I plan to discuss music, philosophy, politics, design, art, the web, and life in general - so welcome to my smorgasborg.  What's in a name?  Not so much as it turns out (kinda like ""Samedis Design""!).... ""Little Speaker"" is an Underworld song and the title sounded reasonably appropriate.  Look for the title to change next time I have another mood change!  Who's your audience?  Well, firstly it's probably myself.  After all, bloggings a bit of a vain exercise in general isn't it?  Secondly, I suppose it's anyone who's interested... friends and family foremost, but it might be nice to have a slightly wider audience - that being the beauty of the web.  That's why we have server logs!  And now, onwards and upwards (or at least sidewards for the time being)...  "
30333,3324842,"24,June,2004",2004-06-24,"   First some links:    urlLink Microsoft is losing the API war    urlLink The Location Field is the New Command Line    urlLink Web Apps are Hot     Now, my take: For a while now, I've become more and more interested in ""teeny-weeny, easy to use but with a very definite purpose"" apps.  Mostly these are coming around implemented as OS X Cocoa Apps.  They all function the way a Mac app should with more or less the same interface conventions, so you can pick them up right away and start using them.  Being a cheapskate, most of the ones I use are also shareware.  Some good examples are  urlLink NetNewsWire ,  urlLink Netflix Freak  and  urlLink xScope .  Apple also has been approaching software this way recently with  urlLink iLife .  The reason I love these so much is that they launch quickly, do their task, and then I get rid of them.  Or, as in the case of apps like Apple's Mail, or NetNewsWire, I just leave them running and they go about their business collecting email and news for me without getting in my way.  These are in marked contrast to the ""Microsoft Office"" way of going about things which is to create one giant behemoth of an app that purports to do anything and everything for you, but is rather difficult to use because there are too many options.  BLOAT.  But now here come the HTML apps.  One in particular that I've taken to using is  urlLink Tasks  to (theoretically) keep myself organized.  I suppose this is the exception to the rule as I do have it installed locally, but the point is (as the above articles expound), that Web Apps just very well may be the future of my favorite little ""small app"" paradise.  The fact is, they're also looking at becoming the future of various larger apps also.  I've developed several of these working for both Bunge and Louis Dreyfus Corporation that do everything from manage a trading system to archiving thousands of documents and allowing for quick and easy retrieval.  Now I don't know if the rise of web apps is going to cause Microsoft to lose the ""API War"", they've proven reasonably resilient in the past, but I want to throw Flash into the mix here.  Flash is widely derided for its creation of the ""Skip Intro"" buttons, and I agree fully with that.  But Macromedia has it's focus in the right direction for the Web App world.  Creating a Web App in a rich client like Flash allows you to get reasonably close to the Desktop App experience with the ease of installation (ie. typing a URL) of a Web App.  I'm not trying to be a Flash apologist here, but I've now built several of these ""Rich Internet Applications"", and I'm sold.  They cost more and development time is longer, but if the web is the future of application development, then Flash has a pretty rightful place there too.  More to follow later as I get the rest of my thoughts together and come up with something that hasn't already been said on the topic!  "
30334,3324842,"01,July,2004",2004-07-01,"   urlLink Todd Dominey hits the nail on the head  with his assessment of Dashboard.  Konfabulor konflagration aside, Apple's going the M$ way of it.  First we had the latest version of Safari only being released for Panther (and I have no doubt that the next version will be Tiger-only), but now we have a proprietary API being constructed also.  Sure, it's specifically for Dashboard and since Dashboard runs off of HTML/Javascript it gets integrated into WebCore which is then available to other apps, but  keep it off the web!   It's all well and good pushing forward the Mac platform with gidgets and gadgets such as Dashboard, but let's not advertise this whole thing as something that can or should ever be put into a non-Dashboard web page.  The web's muddy enough as is and the web standards advocates already have their hands full trying to clean things up  - the last thing we need is Apple dumping their proprietary APIs in to muddy things up even further!  By the way, Dashboard also raises another dilemma: Apple's introduced so many new interface designs since OS X started (first it was aqua, then brushed metal, and now GarageBand does it's own thing entirely...), what's the interface recommendation for ""widgets""?  Apple used to be known as the best of the bunch in Human Interface Design, but now it seems the original vaunted standards have been left behind and replaced with Steve's whim o' the week.  "
30335,3324842,"05,August,2004",2004-08-05,"   Okay, nothing has been written for a while.  Plenty has happened in my life... but more on that later.  For now, let's focus on something rather inconsequential instead: SUVs.  I can't stand the damn things - this is no secret. This is more of a personal dictum than something that I bother applying to other people, however.  You want to drive one, go ahead, there's no law against it... or is there?  Well, actually, turns out there is!  At least on California local residential roads.  As it happens, local roads in California have a ban on heavy trucks weighing more than 3 tons (6000lbs),the weight delimiter between light and heavy trucks.  Reasons for this are pretty straight-forward, including the damage done to the roads, the noise generated, etc.  Makes sense?  Sure does... but guess what,  urlLink your SUV almost definitely qualifies for this ban.   A very interesting article about a law that will never ever be enforced.  However, it does make me hate the SUV just a little bit more.  "
6359,3326628,"13,May,2004",2004-05-13,"   Man, I love this show.  The writing is pretty tip top, but the actors and their deadpan humor make the show genius.  Hopefully the American version will do the Britich original justice.  Don't count on it with the censors we have to deal with.  "
6360,3326628,"13,May,2004",2004-05-13,"   I just listenend to the new Wilco album that is due out June 22.  It is simply an amazing listen.   Now, this is a band that plays music simply because they have no choice, they love doing it for themselves and their fans.  They release their albums online months before commercial release and still hundreds are lined up on the day of the album's release to buy it.  That's what you call trust.  "
6361,3326628,"13,May,2004",2004-05-13,"   ACNE!!!  I have had it since the onset of puberty, but very minimal and normal like any other teenager.  Last fall is when it took a turn for the worse.  I think it had to do with the fact that your body changes every 7 years, and my time of change had come - just not the change I had expected.  You think your acne will go away along with your teenage years, but no, my acne got worse, the kind that are deep, painful, and leave red marks for weeks.  I was clueless on how to deal with it.  It wasn't a simple matter of hygiene or diet, it was infection and pain - both physiological and physical.  I tried Proactiv, toothpaste, neosporin, everything over the counter for a couple months and finally went to the gynecologist to see if the birth control pill could rid me of this hormonally linked problem.  I started on that, but no changes in my skin had taken place.  I graduated college a couple months later, and went home in the middle of winter depressed, but with an appointment to a dermatologist at the suggestion of my mom.  The derm prescribed me a oral antibiotic and 2 topicals.  I saw some results after 6 weeks, no more deep and painful lesions, but the persistent acne was still there.  I was still was so hopeless and alone.  I really don't think people know what persistent acne sufferers go through, unless they have had it themselves.  It has nothing to do with vanity.  It goes so much deeper than that.  Anyways, I came across a website (I have become very proficient in this area) called  urlLink Acne.org  which basically suggests a Benzoyl peroxide regimen.  Well, after regular visits to the site and further frustrations with the doctor's medicines, I tried the regimen.  Let me just say, it worked within a week.  It was my miracle.  My face is about 99% clear.  I don't know why I hadn't tried it earlier.  All I know now is that in some sort of odd way, I am thankful for my experience with acne.  It made me even more humble and more aware of others in similar situations.  Every time I am out and see someone with bad acne, I want to shout out ""Acne.org"".  Suffering isn't overrated, but one can not do it forever without going mad.  "
6362,3326628,"13,May,2004",2004-05-13,"   but blood, toil, tears, and sweat.""  Winston Churchill said this 64 years ago today, as he had just been elected new Prime Minister of England three days prior.  He also inherited a world war, further ensuring his fellow allies that victory would come ""at all costs, victory in spite of terror, victory however long and hard the road may be.""  Yeah, I know it sounds familiar.  I'm sure something similar has been said at numerous times throughout the history of wars.  It's the only rational way to go about such an event.  I doubt very much that  urlLink Abraham Lincoln  put a casualty maximum or time limit on the Civil War.  He kept fighting.  Victory ensued.  The country was reconstructed, slavery slowly abolished, but not before the 16th president of the United States was shot and killed, along with numerous others.  The first presidential assassination in American history had occurred and was thus the ultimate price to pay for victory.  Perhaps the dramatic reminder of mortality sealed his immortality.  Is death, suffering, and pain necessary for victory, for triumph, for peace?  Does one's life have to pass before our eyes before we get it?  I don't know.  Clouds rain upon the ground, and we end up with floods  and  the alleviation of famines.  There isn't a clear cut argument for or against war.   urlLink $50 billion , however, is nowhere near the cost of one casualty.  What do we have left to win when we have already lost so much.  "
6363,3326628,"13,May,2004",2004-05-13,"   It really isn't a question of whether or not to do so, but rather a question of where and on what.  I have blogged every day for the past 23 years in my thoughts, essays, and arguments.  It is now time to put it into a modern medium, a more colorful and legible form.  So here it is, a page dedicated to me, myself, and I, on what I love, even if it will never love me back.  "
21663,3327285,"28,May,2004",2004-05-28,"   OK, its the final hour before the end of the work week and a 3-day weekend.  You'd think I would be excited.  Well you're wrong.  This day is going by so slow that I can actually feel myself getting older as each minute passes.  The day started off fine.  The first 2 hours flew by.  But then the hour before lunch basically dragged, knowing full well that I was going to cherish lunchtime.  And from there, this day has just dragged on, kicking and screaming.  And for what?  I don't have any plans.  I'm not going anywhere.  Its not like there is anything for me to be excited about that would make me want to leave.  No, its just the fact that this is the final day before a 3-day weekend.  That's all it really is.  And its pissing me off.  Come on...all you need to do is say 4:00 and I am gone.  Is that so difficult?  For the love of all things small and furry....GET ON WITH IT!!!!  "
21664,3327285,"25,May,2004",2004-05-25,"   Is anyone actually reading this?  I mean besides those who I asked to read it?  I guess its hard to expect someone to just up and read your blog, especially if no one knows it exists.  Perhaps I should put a counter at the bottom of the page?  Yeah, then I will know just how pathetic I really am because the damn counter will never change.  Sigh.    Anyway, I guess what really tipped off this latest rage is the current state of music.  I just don't understand.  Are there really that many idiots in this world?  I was reading about how experts predict that this season of American Idiot has become the most popular and they expect the finale to be the biggest yet.  Are you serious?  There are really that many retards in the world?  I mean come on, who gets the satisfaction of knowing that glorified karaoke singers are competing for a million-dollar contract and a guaranteed tour?  I certainly don't.  There are many unsigned and struggling bands out there that would kill for the opportunity to even open for an established act, and yet, these darlings of the television are being handed a contract and record with a minimum of going platinum at least twice (well, except for that Justin guy...but seriously, did you expect him to be any good with hair like that and a stupid smirk on his face?) and all they had to do was sing cover tunes for a television audience.  Yeah, real deserving.  And if I have to get into another argument with someone over how ""the pressure they suffer is so immense that they deserve to have a record and tour"" I am going to go Manson and stab someone in the belly with a fork.  Seriously, who can justify this argument?  Look at the facts:  1.) Kid stands in line for several hours for a chance to ""audition"" in front of an ""expert"" panel of ""judges"". 2.) If the kid can impress a fat, uninspiring album producer, a washed-up, has-been choreographer (who has no business telling someone they can or can't sing when she couldn't hold a tune herself), and a bitter, pretentious label head (who only got his notariety by doing that which makes the most sense...telling kids with no talent that they, in fact, have no talent), they are off to Hollywood...well, their parents, partners, whatever will take them to the airport where they will fly to Hollywood. 3.) Once in the land of stars, they will, once again, ""audition"" for the ""judges"", only this time they do routines and duets.  Ooh, that's difficult.  Singing with another person.  YAWN!!! 4.) They get selected and spend the next 8-10 weeks (if they survive) singing covers 2 nights out of the week, and spending the rest of the time in a tricked out mansion in Malibu.  Oh the horror.  This group right here are already guaranteed a single on a compilation album, and a tour later in the year...wow, I don't now how they can take all this pressure. 5.) The final 2 will perform live with a song that they have been ""working"" on for the whole time.  America (read: 30-million screaming girls and gay boys speed-dialing and text messaging Fox) votes on who they think is better, and boom, instant #1 single (because radio forces it on the airwaves 24/7 for a month), album, tour, etc.  Now, where in there is the pressure of having to deal with an audience that hates your music?  When do they get to see what its like for a band to have beer bottles chucked at them?  How are they deserving?  How are they stressed?  As far as I am concerned, all they do is sing some tunes, live in a 'Real World'-type house, and have absolutely no responsibility whatsoever.  Fuck, they don't even write their own songs.  And here's further proof of how bullshit this show is.  That ugly red-headed kid, whatever his name is, did not have any business being in there.  He had no talent (pretending to croon like ol' Blue Eyes is not talent...I can do that while taking a shit) to speak of and was about the whitest thing on Earth next to Carlton from 'Fresh Prince of Bel Air"".  I'm sorry, but this needs to stop.  Something has got to give.  When will America see that all they are doing is flooding the airwaves with more disposable tunes and less-talented singers.  I don't mind pop music.  There are some really talented acts out there (Christina and Jessica, Outkast, etc.), but then there are these damn fake pop princesses that think they are the top of the world (I blame Britney..she has a cute face, nice ass, perky tits, but she can't hold a note to save her life and her songs are obviously written by a 54-year old man), and its these ""stars"" that have tainted the music world and have allowed the insurgence of crap that is...American Idiot.  "
21665,3327285,"18,May,2004",2004-05-18,"   So what started out as a pretty shitty start to the week turned pretty positive.  Monday I came into work pissed off from the obvious oversight that my boss made the week before in handing my job to someone other than me and realized that I had a 3-hour website developer's class to attend.  So that was a bit of a plus, seeing as this meant I didn't have to be in my building for the first half of the day.  Anything to keep my distance from the ball of negativity that has built up over here.  Anyway, so I attend this class, fully expecting it to just be cut and dry nonsense that I already knew, when I came to find out that the company is going to be creating a web developers position, and that I was the lead candidate for it.  Naturally I was high as a kite with this info.  I just came off of a bad weekend, and now, suddenly, I forgot the travesty of not getting the promotion.  So this made for a very good morning.  Then, once class was over and I got back to work, my boss pulled me into the office and asked me to pick out my co-worker.  Basically he felt that since I KNOW what is best for my department, that I should be the one to pick the team.  So I got to pick my co-worker that I have been trying hard to get over here.  Bonus happiness for me.  Now, I hear that not only do both of my girlfriend's children have ear infections, but now the youngest has a rash caused by the medicine she was given to combat it.  Not only that, but my grandmother informed me that my grandpa had a pacemaker installed to help regulate his heartbeat.  Great, so now I can only hope that equally momumental highs are in store for me, otherwise the title for this blog is quite false, wouldn't you say?  "
21666,3327285,"16,May,2004",2004-05-16,"   Well, this post finds me in a foul, yet vulnerable mood.  Recently two constituents of mine had been removed from their positions in my department for illegal behavior that cost the company some dough.  One of these people happened to be my immediate boss.  Now this wasn't some run-of-the-mill asshole by any means.  I have worked with him for several years (6 to be exact).  The same goes for my co-worker who was also let go.  She was a firecracker in her own right, but she was one of the guys nonetheless.  Getting to the point, with my boss' removal, this opened up his position.  Now, not to take anything away from my ex-boss' performance, but he didn't exactly make HIMSELF look good, it was a combination of efforts between myself and my ex co-worker.  I had worked under him in another department 2 years prior, and it has been brought to my attention NOW that it was my efforts then that made him look good enough to get the job that he has recently been removed from.  I practically did his job, and all at the same time I made him look good.  Of course, little voices coming at me have led me to believe NOW that after all I did for him, he spent a good part of his tenure trying to debunk my efforts and, in essence, have me fired for incompetency.  What the hell is this?  After all I did for him, all the whining I endured, all the time we spent hanging out and grabbing drinks had all been for naught.  Well, this left me feeling pretty shitty, but also it instilled in me the power to regroup and try for his vacated position, a feat that should have been rather simple...If it weren't for one person, the ass-kisser.  I had the job pegged.  It was mine.  My supervisor, the one doing the hiring, even told me the job was written for me.  But, there was foul work afoot.  See, I work in an off-site building from my company's main campus.  We are a small, autonomous operation that employees 8 people.  We have our own system of leadership that runs very well, and we are a pretty tight group of people.  But, the particular operations I am involved with here is relatively new to this group.  And one of the people that started in this building, an ass-kisser by nature and reputation, has been hard-up for a leadership role since the my group showed up.  He was always promised, but never saw results.  He was ready to leave, and tried unsuccessfully several times prior to secure a leadership position outside of our building.  When the firings went down, you would have thought he was a starving dog salivating over a freshly-cut side of beef.  He was about to sink his teeth into it, until I stepped up and noted my desire to lead my group.  Then he stepped back, feeling the hurt of knowing that someone was more qualified than him to get the position.  A short victory for me that would never be celebrated.  When he announced to the super of his reluctance to apply for the job because of me, the super should have accepted it as the best thing to do and left it at that....but no.  He told him to apply anyway, as he wanted a variety of good candidates to choose from.  I saw this, originally, as a proving ground to stake my claim in once the position was handed to me.  What I should have seen was an obvious ploy to hand over MY job to the resident ass-kisser that the super has had a boner for since the day they started the operations.    No, he's not gay...he just sees himself in this kid.  I say kid because I am 3 years his elder.  I also have 3 years seniority over him.  So I should have rightfully received this job by default...but this is not the case.  In the end, ass-kiss gets the job and I get the bullshit cookie-cutter explanation of ""He's had the leadership role in his eye a lot longer than you, and while you have the technical know-how and this position was practically made for you, I have to follow my instinct and go with what I feel is the better candidate.""  Are you fucking kidding me?  Did he just say that?  This job was made for me...I am the most-qualified for the job...but because I didn't have the desire to be a leader (unbeknownst to said super, I have been trying to leave the building for some time in a leadership capacity, but nothing ever materialized from my leads), I lost out?  Are you on drugs?  How the hell can you begin to tell me something like this?  I should have seen it coming, but I was filled with so much pride from the number of people who wished me luck and assured me I would get the job that I was blindsided by this obvious case of favoritism.  I'd take it to HR, but in all honesty, it would cause me more grief from my super thinking I hate him, and my new boss thinking I am trying to screw him over and cost him his newly-acquired job.  So, what do I do?  Simple...start looking for something new.  Either inside the company, or out, I am poised with my schooling and my skills to find something better...and to get out of this obviously lop-sided rule that is going to run the building into a brick wall.  I used to have pride in my job...now I'm embarrassed I even work there.  Pity, because I make a good living and have a lot of time in it.  I just can't STAND to see undeserving people get a high-paying gig with responsibility they will obviously squander, or hand down to me for them to take credit for.  Ah, office life.  "
21667,3327285,"13,May,2004",2004-05-13,"   You know what really pisses me off?  Stupid people.  And I am not talking about those who occasionally have a brain lapse and do something stupid...no no no.  I am talking about people who thrive in their stupidity.  These people have as much stupidity as I have blood.  If stupidity were a currency, they'd be billionaires.  I think you get my point.  There are times where I feel like God put these people on Earth just to piss me off.  They get in my way, talk their talk, and then argue to no end about their stance, only to annoy me and make me bow out in default.  Want an example?  My bank made an error in their favor that cost me roughly $60.  This made no sense to me, so I called up the customer support department, being that this is the only way to get an answer without listening to 20 different recordings all telling me how much they value my service and which button I should press to achieve nirvana.  So this half-wit answers (How do I know she's a half-wit?  Easy, she has a nice, thick Kentucky accent, that's how.)  I calmly explain my quandary and ask that it be rectified immediately.  I give out all my pertinent information she asked for, and I sat patiently as she fat-fingered my account number into the computer 3 times (I know she fat-fingered because no one hits 7 keys all at once without screwing something up...it was that loud..I heard them over the phone).  Anyway, so she types in all this information and then says I overdrafted my account, not once, but twice, and they charged me $60 in fees.  Here's the kicker...there isn't anything on my register or transaction log that shows where these could have originated from.  I put just enough money in this account to pay bills, and no more.  There should have been about $17 left in this account.  All my transactions added up correctly, and the total balance was $16.74.  I mention all this to her, once again in a nice, friendly tone.  She then goes on about how I had two debits, one for $21.20 and one for $1.00 in that overdrafted my account.  I asked who they were from, a little annoyed now because who the hell debited my account without my authorization?  She stated that these were from Verizon Wireless.  Ah, the cell phone company.  But what the hell, they got their money for my bill 2 weeks ago, what's this?  At this point I am logging onto my online banking page to see, in detail, what they debited.  I log onto the page, and there aren't any debits listed.  I ask her to verify her information, and then to make sure she was looking at my account.  She states everything correctly, but these two debits do not exist on my account.  I am getting a little steamed at this point because she's just typing away, telling me I owed them this money and that there is nothing that they can do to help me out.  I ask her why these aren't showing up on my account, and she says its because Verizon cancelled these debits before they posted to the account.    Great, so I shouldn't have overdraft charges then, right?  Wrong.  She claims that my account still overdrafted.  I ask her to prove it.  I told her to add up all that was on there and then subtract it from my beginning balance and tell me what she gets.  What was her answer?  $16.74.  What did she say then?  ""Well, then when you factor in the $60 in fees, its -$43.26.  WHAT?!?!  DID YOU JUST SAY THAT?!?!?!  YOU JUST TOLD ME MY ACCOUNT WAS IN THE POSITIVE, YET YOU STILL ADD IN THE OVERDRAFT CHARGES?!?!?!  DOES THIS NOT MAKE ANY SENSE TO YOU?!?!?  DID YOU TAKE MATH IN SCHOOL?!?!?!  She gets upset (and rightfully so) and tells me I need to speak with her manager.  ""Good, I was beginning to actually feel my IQ slip below 140 during this conversation,"" I so eloquently stated.  I heard her sigh as she put me on hold.  Ah the power of being an asshole.    So the manager gets on, tells me that I have upset his employee, to which sent me into another tirade that basically left him breathless and without any cocky/witty comeback.  He asked me to tell him what was wrong, I explained, and wouldn't you know it, he credited my account for the 2 erroneous fees, and issued a stern warning of ""Next time you call, try to be a little courteous to our staff as they are only trying to help.  If not, we could be forced to close your account.""  I scoffed at his warning and told him, ""Do something stupid like this again and I will not only close my account for you, but I'll see your asses in court for incompetence, harassment, failure to provide service, and theft,"" and quickly hung up the phone.  Ah, the fun I have in my life with stupid people....what bliss.  And all this on a Friday.  Oh what fun will the weekend bring?  "
21668,3327285,"12,May,2004",2004-05-12,"   Well, it only took me 5 years to build up enough curiosity to look into this blogging phenomenon.  Hmm, and I thought I was on the cutting edge of technology-driven pop culture.  There goes my ego, deflated and bruised.  Ah, anyway, I guess a brief introduction is in order for all those who choose to view this atrocity of a blog (is this even a word?).  My name is Josh.  I was born, raised, and probably will die in Indiana.  I live a pretty normal life.  Well, I guess that's an exaggeration.  My life is quite unique.  I am blessed with the ability to sponge up any and all useless knowledge and store it away for use at a later date.  This is especially helpful when I pop into a pub with the fellas and someone rants on and on about a particular line uttered in a movie or what kind of music a particular media icon might enjoy.  Some brandish me a know-it-all, but I like to think of it as an eccentric breadth of knowledge that they are too jealous to appreciate.  Perhaps I'll be on Jeopardy one day.  Anyway, I work for a major, international diagnostics company based here in Indiana.  I make a good living, earn good money, live in a great apartment, and have a very beautiful girlfriend.  Oh, I'm 25...just to clear that up.  Yeah, I know...I should be living in a house.  Well, that's another story for another time.  I think I have summed up the basics that will get you through these posts....oh wait, I almost forgot.  I am a rambler by heredity, so these posts will probably be pretty long-winded and bounce all over the place from topic to topic.  Dammit, I'm eccentric, get over it.  Also, I am a pretty funny guy.  Most people say things like that and really aren't, but I seriously am.  I crack myself up sometimes with the words that fall out of my mouth.  Perhaps some of that will spill over into this........then again, this is just a glorified diary...the only comedy in that is the pathetic attempt at trying to make yourself seem witty when all you really are doing is talking to yourself, pretending someone will actually read this and think, ""Hmm, this guy is pretty cool, I wish I was like him.""  Sigh, why do I even bother.  Perhaps I shouldn't have done this after all....curse you, insane curiosity.  Why do you torment me so?!?!?!  "
21669,3327285,"29,June,2004",2004-06-29,"   I feel like I am on an episode of Star Trek and this is my little captain's log.  I don't really have too much to write about at this point, but I thought I would drop a line on here for those precious few who are actually reading this (I got your emails...I am updating this finally...but for the sake of my sanity...please just leave a comment).    The first of my summer adventures has come and passed, and I miss it.  This was the family reunion trip.  Things didn't happen they way I wanted it to, and we only ended up spending about an hour and some change at the actual reunion.  But all in all, we had a good time.  The cabin we stayed in was absolutely atrocious.  It was obviously a fisherman's cabin for the lake we were on, and the cleanliness depicted this fact nicely.  The beds were big and comfy, but they were brown from obvious years of use.  As for the funtime merriment...well, there wasn't much.  It rained for much of Friday, leaving us stuck inside with nothing to do.  There wasn't any cable to speak of, so watching TV was not happening.  We ended up going to my family's house and hung out there for a while, basically having a mini-reunion if you will.  Because of the state of the cabin, we had to get out of there, so Friday night we spent driving around, trying to pickup a cell phone signal to make a reservation to a hotel.  I know what you're saying...""Why don't you just go home?""  ""Its not like you were far away or anything?""  Well, we didn't want to go home.  We wanted an indoor pool for the girls to go swimming in, and I wanted to stay somewhere nice and different for the remainder of the weekend, so we reserved a room at a new Fairfield Suites in Clarksville, IN (just across the river from Louisville) and stayed there.  The girls loved it, and we slept like babies that night.  So in summary...we didn't go boating on the lake...the cabin was disgusting...we only spent an hour and a half at the reunion...and we ended up staying the last night in a hotel.  Sounds like nothing went according to plan and I should be upset, huh?  Well, you're wrong.  If there's one thing people have come to learn about me, its that I love the unexpected.  Sure, I love to have everything mapped out, but I allow myself to deviate from that plan if I have to.  And as far as I am concerned, we had the best time possible, and it made my love for my future wife that much more.  It was great...so what's next?  Our trip to New York has been cancelled.  Cyndi's (my woman) mother has decided she isn't going to watch Cyndi's children while we go to New York, so this has left us in a pickle.  So instead of breaking the court order to not take the children out of state without the ex's permission (which he will obviously deny just to be a cockhead), we have decided to just not go...which is fine considering that it would have cost us damn near $1000 to do it.  Money well saved.  So that frees up that weekend.  What we have decided to do is take the girls to Lake Michigan to go swimming that weekend.  I think they will love it.  It sure as hell beats spending a weekend with their grandmother.  Other than that, all the other plans are still on and I can't wait....bring it on...summer rules.  "
21670,3327285,"13,June,2004",2004-06-13,"   Well, this was by far the most whirlwind of all weekends, believe me.  Three shindigs of varying importance, and several events set to transpire in the coming months, all happening within a 72-hour time frame.  Below is a listing of what happened and what's to come.  You'll get a pretty CLEAR depiction of just how busy things have gotten.  Parties  Friday - My bride-to-be and myself attended my grandparents' 50th wedding anniversary.  It was held in a quaint little room in a good-sized banquet facility.  The price of the food during normal dining is listed in the local paper as moderate, so you can imagine the type of fare we were expecting to have.  But never in my wildest dreams did I expect to be exposed to food of this caliber.  Lets put it this way, for those who aren't too keen on massive details...it sucked.  It was basically a buffet dinner, which I am not opposed to in the slightest.  The salad was the traditional roughage, with broccoli and cauliflower thrown in for good measure.  The choice of dressings was either fat-free Ranch (barf), a paltry excuse for French, or a dismal and bland oily Italian (the little lady hated it).  The dinner was worse.  Rock hard rolls with no butter, grease-infused chicken, very wet cole slaw, bland scalloped potatoes, and the worst cafeteria-style mashed potatoes I have ever tasted.  It was horrible.  But, it was quickly forgotten as we celebrated this huge milestone in the sacred bond of love.  Aside from the food, it was a fabulous occasion.  Saturday - My lady's older daughter celebrated her 4th b-day today at a bash we had thrown for us at The Children's Museum of Indy.  An expensive effort, but rewarding nonetheless when we saw her face light up in joy.  It was marred by an accounting error and a lack of cohesive organization on the part of the organizers.  Basically they wanted $50 more than they were owed and because they took too long to play dress up with the children, we had our party go over and the present-opening was cut from the itinery.  Pissed us off, but it was still fun.  Sunday - Went to the woman's friend's shipping-off party.  Her friend is heading to the Navy on Tuesday, so this is their send off to her.  Had some good food, mingled, watched some insightful TV, and learned that if you pet a male Pug dog on the back of the neck just right, his little pink rocket will pop out for the whole world to see.  A learning experience for everyone to indulge in.  Plans  Listed here are things we are supposed to do for the next 2 months.  This is in no particular order, but is on the agenda: Weekend camping trip Weekend trip to Kings Island with another couple Family Reunion in Southern Indiana Surprise 50th b-day party for my woman's aunt in New York My niece's 5th b-day party Fourth of July cook-out with my family Company picnic at the zoo Company outing to Kentucky Kingdom  This is all things I have learned of planned in the past week, and summer hasn't even officially begun yet.  Oh what fun lies in the near future.  Also, stick in a potential trip to Cedar Point with the lady's boss, and yet more hilarity ensues.  Ah, summer...just a couple days ago I was yearning for the old days...now I feel like my wish is granted...more things to do than I have time/money for.  "
21671,3327285,"08,June,2004",2004-06-08,"   Hello all...me again.  So another Memorial Day weekend has come and gone and with it, the childish splendor that is summer vacation.  I remember a time when I loved Memorial weekend.  The Indy 500, barbecues, no more school, road trips with the family.  Times were a lot simpler and fun.  But now, I look back and I feel empty.  A void that has replaced that warmth and happiness.  Why?  What am I missing?  Ah yes....youth.  Looking back, I feel old.  I know it was only 12 years ago, but when you think about it, that's a really long time.  That's infancy, toddler, elementary school-age, puberty, and pre-teen, to put it into perspective.  And thinking about THAT alone is enough to make me sick to the stomach.  Gone are the carefree days where we can wake up at noon and go to bed at 3am.  Gone are the days of calling up your friend and popping over to watch their father's pornos while talking about the intricacies of a boner and how big a certain schoolmate's breasts are.  Gone is the excitement of your parents telling you that the whole family is heading to **insert theme park name** for the weekend or to **insert family gathering** in **insert state** for a week.  And gone is the passion and desire of a young couple's summer love, tinged with sexual innuendo and heavy petting in a conditioned and controlled ""exploration period"".  Yeah, while some people look at Memorial Day weekend and think about warm weather, swimming pools, and camping trips, I sit back and sadly recall a time when I didn't care about responsibility, and I didn't worry about how much money I have or if I will be able to pay all my bills.  I solemnly reminisce on a period of my life where I genuinely felt happy, with no need for outside companionship or monetary stability.  Most people love this time of year....I dread it.  It brings up painful memories of a doomed first relationship.  It leaves me pondering the kind of summers I'll be able to provide my girlfriend's children (and perhaps our own if we ever make it that far), but most of all...it leaves me longing to be young again, in the thick of adolescence, where my only concerns and worries are who's house are we setting a tent up in and how much trouble am I going to be in because I am 20 minutes late in coming home for the night.  Ah, growing up....how I loathe your rank embrace of adulthood.  "
21672,3327285,"06,August,2004",2004-08-06,"   Well, it was bound to happen sooner or later...I post another entry.  As you can tell, I am not really jumping into this like its an actual diary or anything. Instead, I am using this as a tool to vent my frustrations. My lack of posting has to do with the fact that I have been, for the most part, not very frustrated. Sure, there's the usual crap that puts a frown on my face, but for the most part, things have been pretty close to tip-top.  So then why am I writing now? Why not shut up and go away until I have something juicy to scream about? Well, because I am bored at work and have no better way to spend my break than to jot some things down. A few ""projects"" in various forms of completion have crept into my social life, leaving me pretty winded. What are they?   Internet Radio Station  That's right, I am working on my very own internet radio station. Now, its not going to be anything huge like  urlLink www.knac.com  or anything of that nature, but it is a springboard that will hopefully launch a side career for me. As you may (if you know me) or may not know, I used to be involved in radio heavily. I worked at a couple stations in Cincinnati, and I even received certification from the Ohio Center for Broadcasting. So as you can see, I am qualified to make this happen. Basically what this entails is running a server from which I will broadcast various types of music through. Am I going to DJ? Well, that depends. As for right now, I am just running music through automation, and that provides for uninterrupted music for as long as I leave the station up. Sometimes its an hour, other times its for a day. It all depends on what I have going. Right now, I mainly use it to listen to something at work, and there is enough slots for 1 other person to listen to what's playing. So, once things get finalized, you'll find out here what's up.   E-zine  OK, this isn't that huge, but basically I am in the process are starting up an e-zine with a couple friends of mine. What is an e-zine exactly? Well, its really something similar to this. Basically its a web-based newspaper that is going to cover various points of interest revolving around the arts. Aside from being the webmaster, I am also going to be a bit of a contributing editor. I'll have a couple columns of differing topics, and perhaps my own review section for albums, movies, books, whatever I can bother myself with. My personal life takes a front seat to all this, and therefore I need to make sure I have my priorities going before I dedicate time and money to that venture.   Novel(s)  Yeah, you read that right. I am working on several novels of different subject matter. I am not going to drop titles or anything as of yet, seeing as I put quite a lot of thought into these and I would hate for someone to steal these titles and make them their own. Screw that, this is my work, dammit, go create your own. I have a semi-autobiographical in there, as I have lived quite an interesting life, mixed with some fiction to spice up boring parts. I am also working on a comedic space epic in the vein of Douglas Adams' fantastic ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"" series and Monty Python. I am also working with a couple friends on a reference guide to all things related to rock. Its not an encyclopedia of rock music that you usually think of...no no no. Its actually a listing for up and coming bands who want to try to get into the biz. Basically I was having conversations with a couple friends of mine who are in bands and how they are sick of not being able to cut a break because of lack of connections. Well, considering I still have a few friends in radio, I tend to have some pretty good connections in this regard, so I decided to put together, with their help, a guide for young, aspiring bands to help get them in the door. I have venues, promoters, studios, rehearsal spaces, and small, independent record labels all listed with write-ups on them. This is going to be a must-have for bands that are deciding to take it serious but not knowing what to do next. This has the potential of being released first, as there are a lot of interested parties who'd love the info we've gathered. Well, there's no such thing as a free lunch, so you'll have to buy it like everyone else.  Anyway, that's what's been up. I just realized that I didn't say a word on this blog for the whole month of July, so I guess this update to what's been up was a bit rewarding. Until I get pissed again, this is your old pal Josh.  "
19513,3327596,"25,May,2004",2004-05-25,   Tomorrow is the LAST day of school. I am REALLY excited.  Hopefully I am going to get to spend the night with Jayme tomorrow.

19515,3327596,"15,May,2004",2004-05-15,   O.k. both of my brothers are in baseball so they have games like EVERYDAY after school so of course I have to tag-along and go to ALL of the games.  It's o.k. though b/c all of those little kids are cute and all of the kids on Destin's team have a crush on me and it's REALLY funny.  Well I  am about to start all my my driver's ed piss.  I really want to do it all and get it over with so I can get my driver's linces but it is going to take along time to do all of that stupid book work PISS!  Well I guess that's all t2yl.   Bye  
19516,3327596,"13,May,2004",2004-05-13,"   Today I was still sick so I stayed home from school once again.  It was REALLY boring.  But oh well I was sick so it doesn't matter.  I just watched t.v. and that's ALL it was so lame but what else are you suppose to do when your grounded?  Well this whole blogger thing is pretty cool. I mean I have a dairy that I write in sometimes but this is better b/c now I feel like if people read this then they will feel my pain in some sort of strange way.  Oh well.  Oh yeah yesterday Jessica called me and she was like yeah Lance is always talking about you at school (meaning the school I went to last year) and hes always like ""yeah I'm gonna take Porsche' to prom next year I'm gonna send a lemo to her house to pick her up with two dozen roses inside, the limo will take her to pick me up and we will go to prom""  Isn't that sweet?  Oh well um I guess that's all for today I'll t2yl.  Love ya,        Porsche'  "
19517,3327596,"12,May,2004",2004-05-12,"   Well today was sort of bad b/c I was sick this morning when I woke up.  I tried to go to school but I got sick during first period and called my mom to come and get me.  So I sat in the office until she got there.

19519,3327596,"03,June,2004",2004-06-03,"   So far summer has been boring. I don't have much to write in you.  But oh well Jayme is always like ""you never write in your blogger any more"" so there you go jayme. Um Jayme you know that you can't talk about any thing that you read in here so just deal with it.  Ok dear diary, I think that Jayme gets mad when Robert sits by me and stuff, b/c she still likes him.  She tells me that she doesn't like him any more but I know that she does. She is going to get mad at me if he sits by me at the movies.  I told her that he should just sit in the middle, so that way he will be sitting by both of us. But she said that she wants to sit in the middle. But then if he sits by me jayme will be on the outside and I will be in the middle.  I personally don't care.  If he sits by me good. I would me happy. But if he sits by Jayme good.  I really don't care. Oh well I am about to go b/c I have to get off the computer b/4 my dad gets home.  Well ill talk to you later. BYE!!  "
23615,3330196,"22,May,2004",2004-05-22,"   i woke up without a hangover from lastnights drinking session, instead my body is in pain from my boxing class. it was a project from last year and only yesterday did i manage to realized it. it was fun and quit addictive. i never new till yesterday how a single round of boxing can exhume so much strenght. i finish four rounds and i tell you it was so exhusting and painfull to the fists. as if all the pain is not enough, i accidentally push the hot water button on the water dispenser that cause some swolleness into my lesf hand. anyway i finish my day yesterday at about 3:am the today..........  "
23616,3330196,"20,May,2004",2004-05-20,"   yesterday i finally made myself a member of redcorner. the idea of it was lingering in my mind since november, last year. i will start tommorrow and hopefully i will go on and reach my goal.....  "
23617,3330196,"19,May,2004",2004-05-19,"   yesterday was the day for my sister, she went to the u.s. embassy for a visa application/interview. i never prayed to god to help her pass the interview, conciously i want her to leave because that will mean cd's and t-shirts. sub-conciously it was different. i am scared and dont want her to go. she doesnt need it. our parents can provide more than enough for both of us, but then again its her life and her decision. she passed and if all goes smoothly she will be living by next month. what will happen to her there is among the many worries me and my parents will endure. we just hope that she succeeds and enjoy life as it comes....  "
23618,3330196,"16,May,2004",2004-05-16,"   ""why are you an artist?""......... ""because i have lots of pain""...... i never saw any episode of six feet under but that may change eventually. i am not an artist but i have lots of pain, lots of disappointments. though unlike before wherein i am under a severe depression, my pain now comes from disappointments and regrets. as much as most of us i also want to go back in time to correct past events that makes me ache in pain now. i am a lonely shadow, always hiding at the back and in search of light so atleast i may be seen and noticed. great regrets often produced fatal outcomes but then again where is the sense in that? i overcome the kindling of suicide and self pitty, i am often smiling now and i can sleep with out any aid of pills, but those are superficial and faux. i may be what others percieved me to be me, but still i am in pain.................  "
23619,3330196,"13,May,2004",2004-05-13,"   may 14, my sleep was disturbed by a txt message from budjie, telling me that they are leaving for puerto gallera. i am supposed to be with them the next morning but desided to follow them on the same day. i traveled alone for the next 2 hours. it was a nice drive almost no traffic, but save from the occational boredom add the loss of radio signal, and a helpful hitchhiker, everything is smooth and fine. by 1 pm, my ferry docked onto the shores of white beach. the first five hours was kinda awkward because jaypee was there, but then again we went there for some good time, any grudge must be left at home. by 2 am the next morning i was tired because it has been a long day, by 9:30 am i am leaving the beach to head back home.  "
23620,3330196,"13,May,2004",2004-05-13,"   this is my first entry and have nothing to say. im hoping i could do this everyday so i can journal my life as i am going into a great bordedom and uncertainty about my future career and relationships. everyday for me is a routine, quite a cycle of very little assortment, less variation, but i am already used to it. no complaints, just ranting, i guess.  "
23621,3330196,"08,June,2004",2004-06-08,"   its been a while since i posted a blog, i was sort of having a writers block, what ever that means. anyway its been raining for some time now, but it is okay. the last three months was scorching and the rain was a welcome relief. though for peewee it means losing income because his into carwash business. i've been going to the gym religiously for three weeks now, im not complaining actually i am enjoying and quite happy with the results. i am more agile and athlethic and give me another month and i will be changing my wardrobe. but not everything is good. the continous rise in fuel will likely go on and it sucks. everyday to and from gym i am spending a good php300.00 for gasoline alone. i change my driving style completely, i hardly floored on the gas pedal but still it consumes gasoline. my body also hurts and i still cannot get the right punch, footwork and position in my boxing class so i always get some flanking from my instructors. i need to improve on my boxing skills.............  "
23622,3330196,"04,July,2004",2004-07-04,"   i miss my sister............. anyway today i am very angry. i cursed someone and i am hoping he would die today, if not sooner. he is so abusive he deserves to die. i am not giving back that one..............i mean it............ i hate this feeling when anger and frustrations are eating in up to my system. i cannot function very well. i cant think clearly. i am so stressed. i just wish all the people who aduse and burden to me and my family will die. i guess if that happen my family will live peacefully and hopefully happy and contented........................

20759,3332079,"22,June,2004",2004-06-22,"    What's love? When you are together with that special someone, you pretend to ignore that person. But when that special someone is not around, you might look around to find them.  At that moment, you are in love.           Although there is someone else who always makes you laugh,your eyes and attention might go only to that special someone. Then, you are in love.   Although that special someone was supposed to have called you long back, to let you know of their safe arrival, your phone is quiet. You are desperately waiting for the call! At that moment, you are in love.  If you are much more excited for one short e-mail from that special someone than other many long e-mails, you are in love.  When you find yourself as one who cannot erase all the messages in your answering machine because of one message from that special someone, you are in love.  When you get a couple of free movie tickets, you would not hesitate to think of that special someone. Then, you are in love.  You keep telling yourself, ""that special someone is just a friend"", but you realize that you can not avoid that person's special attraction. At that moment, you are in love.   "
10694,3343294,"24,May,2004",2004-05-24,"   I had my two hour sailing class on Friday and my four proteges could have used instruction in more than just water based activities. They didn't really want to listen to my sailing instruction and I had trouble organizing it in a cohesive way.  Watching these people mingle made me realize I need to either settle or give up by my late 30s, dating can not continue forever.  "
10695,3343294,"21,May,2004",2004-05-21,"   This afternoon I am Captain of the Single's Cruise at a local marina. I have been asked to sail around some local singles while they mingle. I get paid for it. It's about a five person boat, so I am not sure what the deal is. How many can they possibly fit?  Unless they are kinky and looking for a three or four-some, it doesn't seem like a practical way to meet people. Not that I am anyone to judge. I just hope I don't get hit on. I will threaten to keel haul them if even one suggests he swab my poop deck. There is a guy who works on the deck down there who is perversely hot. He has skin that looks like leather, and when he once helped me out of the boat his hand felt like a monkey's, but he has this incredibly tanned thing going on. I don't want to get the first sexually transmitted melanoma, but as Captain of the single's cruise, I should have certain rights.  "
10696,3343294,"20,May,2004",2004-05-20,"   So now I've decided to have this leg lengthening surgery and I wish I could have scheduled it for tomorrow. I'm absolutely incapable of starting anything that I'll be unable to complete before this planned 6 week hiatus from life.  I was in therapy yesterday discussing my recuperation time. My therapist seems to think its a bad idea for me to spend this period at my parent's house. I'm not sure how else I can afford the procedure, as insurance covers only 90% of my physical therapy, which will have to be daily, and Short term disability (STD) insurance, covers 60% of my income.  Couldn't they have come up with a better name for it? It sounds like I'm stuck at home with a particularly bad case of the clap. I can't figure out how to upload pics to this site. Maybe I'll figure that out later. I don't have anything relevant at the time anyway. Once the surgery has happened I should have some gory stuff. I'm really bored at work today. I did some internet searches and read another fascinating blog on blogspot about the newest Capitol Hill sex story - Washingtonienne. It's full of such wisdom as ""A man who tries to fuck you in the ass when you are sober does not love you."" Words to live by.  The new trend seems to be blogging about fucking. Blogging is really one of the most self absorbed thing one could embark on - assuming someone else wants to actually the minutae of our life. It is only natural that in an effort to gain attention and readers, fuck talk is becoming popular. I doubt there will be much of that for me this summer. Typically, every summer I fuck someone new. It's kind of a tradition. I don't know how many positions are going to be possible with a broken leg though.  "
10697,3343294,"14,May,2004",2004-05-14,"   I have decided after 15 years to revisit this lousiest of childhood experiences, and have two even legs. I worry that I am looking for too much out of it.  I am afraid when I use the term ""whole"" accidentally to describe my post operative state. Surgery made me such a mess when I was little, maybe I would have been anyway, but it couldn't have helped. Now I want it fixed and I don't want to be thinking somewhere that it's going to fix ME. I like to make fun of the white trashy people on that tv show on Fox ""The Swan"" where they're all fucked up and compete to be the most pathetic who deserves a makeover. Like Queen for a Day but with a tit lift.  "
10698,3343294,"14,May,2004",2004-05-14,"   I don't think I spelled inaugeral right but I am too lazy to look it up. It just doesn't look right.  Anyway, I am creating this blog in the hopes that anyone else who might be considering a similar procedure can learn from my experience. I have not found any blogs by folks undergoing similar experiences, and I hope to inform others, as well as review and organize my own thoughts and feelings in regard to leg lengthening and my experiences with it. This is going to be a little bit technical and a little bit personal.  I'll start out by setting the stage with a little bit of background. I have ""Hemihypertrophy"". What is this? Google says: Hemihypertrophy refers to the overgrowth (hypertrophy) of one side of the body. A person with hemihypertrophy will be found to have enlargement of the body on the affected side, so that the chest may be more full on the affected side as well as the arm and leg being longer and thicker in diameter.  Hemihypertrophy in infants and young children is important because such children have a much higher incidence of certain abdominal cancers, notably Wilm's tumor of the kidney and hepatoblastoma (liver cancer). Unequal leg length cause some walking difficulties as well.  Children with hemihypertrophy require careful periodic followup examinations to detect any early sign of malignancy. This followup must continue for a number of years.  Hemihypertrophy can be a familial trait or may occur sporadically.  In my case, it occured as a sporadic birth defect. No one knows why it happened. Sometimes, these things just do. I don't have any of the internal complications. The difference is not visible, you can't tell by looking at me that, say one of my eyes, or my breasts is bigger. My mom claims that she can tell that one of my eyes is bigger, and as for by breasts, I've never had any comments!  It was discovered that my right leg was longer when I was very young. I begin seeing an orthopaedic surgeon in nearby Boston, at the Floating Hospital, a children's hospital which began, curiously, on a boat. It's no longer aquatic and is now close to Chinatown.  They determined that the best strategy was to arrest the growth of my right leg. They did so by removing my growth plate with two operations at age 9 and 10. I was in the hospital for several days. I am a bit foggy on my memories of this, as I was young, scared, and not emotionally prepared for what I was undergoing. I don't remember the procedure, and I don't know if this is because I was never told exactly what was happening or because I have blocked it out.  My Dr., Dr. Michael Goldberg, did not have a manner which was appropriate for a pediatric surgeon. In my opinion, he should have stuck to the adults.  After the surgeries, I continued to grow taller than anticipated. I am still the shortest one in my immediate family at nearly 5'9"".  My right leg stopped growing, but my left continued and surpassed it by 2.7 cm. This is approximately the discrepancy I had to begin with, only reversed.  Dr. Goldberg recommended I live with the difference and suggested I begin seeing another Dr. I think he did not want to be reminded of his error. There wasn't anything he could do for me at that point anyway. He was such a prick.  My new Dr. is doing this procedure: www.iskd.com  - it looks pretty gnarly but I've been promised a morphine drip. Hopefully there's a limit on that bad boy or I'll OD my first day in.  "
16523,3344485,"18,May,2004",2004-05-18,"   Wake up, french kiss her, good morning... Talk about all the things that are still longer to believe. Talk about the love, the truth, and how much she meant to me. The truth is, she's all that I need... All night I would sleep on the bed just to be closer to her...  Everyone is talking, talking about us, the love, the truth between us. I didn't care much, just need to be closer to her, so as to take a closer look at her...   Although the night is not long, I would be thinking about her. When I closed my eyes, I won't be alone because I'll be thinking about her. I've got nothing to prove to her about the truth, just as to tell her, how much I love her.  She didn't need to hear, when I said these words, ""I can't sing a love song to you, I can't be romantic like the way it's meant to be. Guess I'm not that good anymore, just the way it meant to be.""   If she told me to lie for her, to cry for her, I could. If she told me to die for her, I would. Just take a look at my face, I would pay anything... just to say these words to her, ""I'll always love you... and I'll always be there for you... Love You, always""   Love, Alan  "
16524,3344485,"16,May,2004",2004-05-16,"   Darkness falls... everything goes so quiet. I could hear the flame burning on my cigarette as I take a puff. Trying hard to capture the silent that I've long desire... The silent in my heart, the silent in my mind...  Silent became my precious, once... Only then, will I be able to hear voices, voices that I had long missed. Voices that only I could hear. The voices of my own prayers...  ""beg of you, hear my prayers, let me go, help me... please help?"".   Loneliness starts taking over my life & my prayers has become an obsession which I prayed every night. Don't know where to go, don't know what to do, mainly staring blankly at the wall... ""What have i done to deserve this? Why me? Why do I have to face this alone? Why is everyone ignoring me?"" questions came to my mind soon after.   Blank mind, it's so quiet.. so comfortable... so dark... so peaceful... reaching out but there is nothing out there... blank!  Walking alone to the kitchen room, turn my head, and there he is again... this time, he's different, he's staring at me with no smile, no laugh in his face. I walked up and looked closely into his eyes... cold is the word to use, so bloody cold... I starts to shiver for that moment from his look in his eyes... He started to reach out for me, so am i... we could barely touch our palm from the opposite side of the world. So real, its so real, I could barely touched him.  ""help me, help me alan... alan, help me..."" voices that i hear when i lay down on the bed staring at the ceiling wall. These voices that I hear, their so familiar... heard it somewhere, but I could not remember whose it belongs to... So familiar... so...  "
16525,3344485,"16,May,2004",2004-05-16,"   ""Why am I doing this to myself?"" i asked myself in the mirror this morning when i woke up. There he is again, smiling at me with his wicked smile. I knew he's laughing at me inside. Laughing at me for my stupidity, laughing at me for not letting it go...  It's been awhile, since i could, hold my head up high. It's been awhile, since i could, feel my own heartbeat. It's been awhile, since I could, say I love myself. It's been awhile, since I could, been addicted to the man behind the mirror. ""Just make these go away!"" is the thought, when I'm alone with no one else. Everything I can't remember, everything seems like a dream. It's been awhile, since I'm sorry...  The concequences are deep... and I had no one else to blame but myself. I kinda fucked things up again and again. ""why can't I just make all these go away? Why?""   ""I will give in anything just to hear your voice, i will give in anything just to be with you..."" these are the words that are crying in my heart. Tears starts to flow downwards onto my cheeks. I hold my head up high, praying to someone else, praying...  This is just the beginning, the beginning to my painful prayers...  "
16526,3344485,"15,May,2004",2004-05-15,"   Everyday, I have to face him when i look into the mirror. The man is always looking at me, smiling and laughing at me.   ""let me out...let it go..."" voices that keep whispering to my ears when i see the man behind the mirror. I always sees him as my worst enemy that I had to face everyday. The man whom I do not want to see everyday. He is the man whom is not rational. Whom he loves pain, violent and cruelty. He is evil. He is crazy. He is barbarous. ""is that who i really am? Is that really me? Who am i? Really, who am i?"" these are my words that came out of my mouth when he's there, in the mirror. I do not know what I have become. I'm so tired at times... repeating myself every single day, reminding myself who i really am, fighting my will against his... But there he is! He's always there when I look into the mirror, staring at me, smiling at me... so evil, so merciless... the unforgettable smile, the unforgettable laughter, the unforgettable voices that i hear, that i see... Sometimes, I kinda enjoy how he feels, what he thinks and what he wants... Its beautiful! No worries, no pain, no mercy... simply evil.  "
16527,3344485,"16,June,2004",2004-06-16,"   Since the day I met you, I can't forget your look, of what you said. I'm addicted, I'm so addicted to you.   When I see you down the streets, I can't pretend I don't know you, I can't pretend I do not care about you. I try, try not to think about the pain inside of me. But it's just too late and I'm ok, I just need to stay away.  Missing you, wonder why? When your near, my heart pumps harder, when your far, my heart hurts. You always seems so far away, and you don't seems you care anymore. I'm sorry, I can't always be there for you. I'm sorry, I can't be your perfect guy. I can't stand it anymore, and nothing seems alright anymore.   No turning back, walk away, I try, but it seems too late. Nothing going to change the things you said, nothing going to change the things you done, just walk away, no turning back. I just wanna make you proud, but there is nothing I can do anymore.  I need a hero to rescue me. Always thought you can be my hero to rescue me, although you can't be perfect but I always think you are perfect. But you always seems you don't care anymore, why?  Now, I've lost it all, I can't go back, nothing I can do anymore. I'm sorry, I try, I already try, I just need to talk to you but you don't seems you understand me anymore. I'm sorry, I'm just not a perfect guy. I'm just another guy who is standing behind the mirror, pretending to be a perfect guy, but it's just too late...  "

Had hard times when i looked into the mirror where i can't face myself no more...   Most times, when i looked into the mirror, i had to find the man behind it, wonder where he had gone, wonder how come he's not there anymore? In my place, where i couldn't change, i was lost... lost in my own fucking place.. I was scared, i was not under prepared, i couldn't find myself anymore... god damn it, i was so scared...  Saying please, saying please... screaming out loud, in my place, in my heart, in my mind, where have i gone to? where have i been to?   All day, staring at the ceiling... all night hearing voices telling me, i might want to get some sleep because tomorrow will be a better day! It's me, it's only me, talking to myself in public, people looking at me, people staring at me, wonder am i crazy or something. laughing to myself, smiling to myself, just to make myself feel easy...  Can't remembered what had happened. Everything seems fine before and it just happened... I'm so addicted, addicted to the man behind the mirror, can't forget his face, can't forget his smile, can't forget his laughter, can't forget him... He's so strong, so free... free of troubles, free from mortal... laughing, i'm laughing now.. don't know why, don't know what happen... just laughing...  Guess i'm just addicted...  "

I treat people as nice as i really could... i treat people with one heart and one soul, i help people and ask for nothing in return... but y am i still so lonely? what are the reasons?  Don't understand, really don't understand... why do i always have to be so lonely? am i destine to be this way? no matter how hard to try, no matter how hard i change, it seems nothing has changed.   People always say sorry, but nothing gonna change, saying sorry and expect nothing had happened, and arent gonna change their mistakes as well.. so what is the point of saying sorry when nothing can be done, when nothing can be changed or nothing is going to changed?  I try so hard to change myself, i really tried... people are greedy and ask for more.. so i give them more and they want more... i always try to satisfy them cos i know i needed a fren, a companion, who will give me abit of concern, who will standby me and lend me their listening ear... no one, no one could do that for me! why? don't understand, really confused.. what have i done to deserve this kinda treatment? what have i done to deserve this kinda loneliness?   Day after day, month after month, years after years... i have been waiting, waiting for a companion... now im getting very tired of waiting already... really tired of waiting... been so lonely for so many years... why do i felt so lonely? why do i have to wait for so long, so long?

Time flies, i learn to survive, learn to enjoy pain, learn to enjoy darkness, learn to enjoy the loneliness around me, learn to lie, learn to cheat... just to survive and i did..   As i grew up, i always wanted to change, change to be a better man and i did... tats why i never give up, never give up on people, i wanted give them hope, give them support that they need.. but why do they give up hope on me? 'stubborn' is the word they use on me because i stated my reasons and my points of view. Chance is what i need and i have been chasing after it. i change wat i can and i already did my best but people still don't give me chance when i fail once... they just give up on me... why?  Now, i begin to like the name 'Sin'. I wonder why? maybe it's because I am one. So i will start calling myself Sin and it seems i liked it alot.

31649,3348721,"23,May,2004",2004-05-23,"   i don't why i was thinking about her but i was reminded of her while shopping the other day.. other people from the rainham area may even remember her.  From an early age, i always used to see this old lady on her bike in Rainham shopping centre, she was never without her shopping from either tesco or Co-op and never far away from her trusty push-bike. she was always smiling and looking eager to get home once she had collected all the groceries she needed. These were piled high in her basket and occasionally fastened behind the back seat (although i had seen her walking up a hill pushing the bike due to the weight of her load). no, of course this doesn't seem that strange. It was only as i got older and had a job during the summer of '94 did i realise that she pretty much seemed to do this every day. Ashamed to say it, i remember seeing her in tesco once and watching to see what she bought. she mainly seemed to stick to the sale items and other items that maybe used for ingredients in cakes and biscuits. I imagined that every night was spent cooking with all these ingredients to make said snacks for her large family made up of grandchildren, nephews and nieces, a woman surely indulging in the old-aged traditions of old age.. The way she use to use cirlce round the precinct on her bike without seeming to notice how fast she was going (she'd just ring the bell and smile if she thought she was within a whisker of you)was like a scene from one of the (in)famous naked gun films. people seemed oblivous to it though, but then it was an every day occurence..  Sadly, on my few visits back to rainham, i no longer see her (the mouth-organ player is still there on a saturday). I guess she was about 70 when i used to see her which would make her 80 now so maybe the bike is no longer an option. I like to think that someone has shown her how to use the internet and she is now getting her shopping delivered every day with a similar urgency.    i finally got my fixed 303 back from the shop today.. it's only been 3 bloody months. the guy made attempts at apologies but didn't seem to know what to say. He knew they had fucked up basically and so did i. Probably very wise as it meant that there was need for me to complain too much.. It is a handy shop and i've used it frequently in the past although extra caution maybe used in future. so i now have another machine that makes a lot of silly noises, i've now just got to learn how to use them properly rather than randomly.   "
31650,3348721,"20,May,2004",2004-05-20,"   i haven't stopped.. really big overstated yawns too and i thought i got a good nights sleep.  I went to Bromley south shopping centre today at lunch and who else but Jordan was signing her (much hyped??) autobiography... the place was full of the kind of people that really should never be allowed to congregate in such abundance.. i felt scared. I didn't actually see her but there were lots of people taking photo's and shouting her name(s). There was a real mixture of people there, obviously lots young men and boys but also a lot of young, scantily clad Jordan lookalike girls too. Are they looking on her to be a role-model with her story of how lots of people have manipulated her over the last 5 years???  still, she's bloody rich for it... Though i do wonder how her back will be in 10 years though.   "
31651,3348721,"18,May,2004",2004-05-18,"   Today i was in Wembley working in a tall office block. I had great view of London. A lovely yellow fog was gently touching the tops of the tallest towers for the best part of the day. The new wembley stadium looks like a giant Asda, that's all i could say when i saw it. ""it's just another bloody Asda building"". why they couldn't knock down the arena as well is beyond me, But then i suppose they use it for ice hockey as well as shit gigs. I'd forgotten how grim it is up there. Again, it's another place i get to work in where there is nothing to do at lunch so you might as well work through it. At least there wasn't so many chavvy type people about which is what i've been used to. The people in Wembley just look genuinely put out and hard done by. The Sad thing about my excursion today was that i decided it was best to go into Kings Cross first, which was way off course but i assumed this would be the only place i would get a decent, large coffee before work. I'm proud to say i was right. I also got home in record time tonight which was another nice little bonus to the day.  I bought the new  urlLink Morrisey  album yesterday. It's good! the first few songs, i felt were growers but the Moz of old seems to kick in when it gets to 'the world is full of crashing bores'. 'how can anyone...', 'first of the gang to die' and 'i like you' are typical anthemic Morrisey tunes. I wont harp on about it as i'm sure this Album wont appeal to a lot of people but i recommend it to anyone who has dabbled in the black arts of 'Mozza' before.  I've had to hide the Shins new album as it's in danger of being overplayed and it would be such a shame for this to happen. i'm gonna try and give it a couple of months now.  Someone informed me today that Keane had got to number 1 in the album charts. Can someone please bloody explain how this happened? i read in an NME recently that they considered  urlLink 'Aphex twin'  to be a big influence on the act.. huh? who tells them to say this shit?? another band in a long line that spurt on about influential artists that they blatantly have nothing in common with. Is anyone safe from the oily brush of PR? Probably not.   i've promised myself that i'm going to do some music tonight, the 'new' band is now making a lot of progress and i'm hoping we'll have at least 3 songs for people to chin stroke, ponder and slowly shake their heads at very soon.  I finally got round to seeing Donnie Darko too on Sunday albeit on a poorly lit laptop and the sound wasn't that hot either. Shame really as it was a good film. Not as great as I was told it would be but their were some nice touches, fairly easy to take in, interesting plot but i wasn't left with anything to think about at the end of the film which i think that's what it wanted (it *was* one of those films, wasn't it?) but at least there was no shit A.I or other form of drawn out Hollywood ending which i feared may happen.   ok, enough of this for now. Things need to be done.   "

She's retired now and does voluntary work and she was incredibly surprised and delighted to see me (it might have been the purple hair). I was incredibly polite and nice as i always was to her (even though she hated me - i used to answer her back but not in a rude way. it was more of a bemused, inquisitive way) and i think she quite enjoyed the chance meeting. still, it was a strange coincidence but strangely things like this no longer freak me out.. coincidences like this are bound to happen occasionally. the burning question on whether she was still having an affair with Mr Evans (it'd been going 20 years or so) remained unanswered..

This produces a shadow and prevents reflections from the surface of the water. Now, the heron can clearly see its prey under the surface of the water. The wings of the bird form a circular shadow on the water's surface, and it always fishes inside this circle.   "
11787,3354778,"15,May,2004",2004-05-15,"    MIRACLES OF THE QUR'AN  The Qur'an was sent to mankind 1,400 years ago, but there are some facts related in the Qur'an whose meanings we have only been able to uncover recently.   From the planets to the stars, human beings to animals, Allah created everything in the universe. Our Lord already knows everything we have not discovered so far and He informs us about some of that in the Qur'an. We can only learn these things when Allah permits us and then we realise that they are miracles of Allah.    How the Universe Came into Existence   He is the Originator of the heavens and the earthâ€¦ (Surat al-An'am: 101)  The universe came into existence from nothing 15 billion years ago. In other words, the universe suddenly came into existence from nothing.   Only the science of the twentieth century enabled us to attain scientific evidence of this great event. Therefore, it was impossible to know this scientifically 1,400 years ago. But, as is also mentioned in the previous verse, Allah told us this fact when the Qur'an was first revealed. This is a miracle of the Qur'an and one of the pieces of evidence that it is the Speech of Allah.    The Expansion of the Universe  In the Qur'an, which was revealed 14 centuries ago at a time when the science of astronomy was still primitive, the expansion of the universe was described like this:  And it is We who have constructed the heaven with might, and verily, it is We who are steadily expanding it. (Surat adh-Dhariyat, 47)  The word ""heaven"", as stated in this verse, is used in various places in the Qur'an with the meaning of space and universe. Here again, the word is used with this meaning. In other words, in the Qur'an it is revealed that the universe ""expands"". And this is the very conclusion that science has reached today.  Until the dawn of the 20th century, the only view prevailing in the world of science was that ""the universe has a constant nature and it has existed since infinite time."" The research, observations, and calculations carried out by means of modern technology, however, have revealed that the universe in fact had a beginning, and that it constantly ""expands.""  Orbits  Many of you know that our world and the other planets have orbits. In fact, not only do the planets in our Solar System have orbits, but also all heavenly bodies in the universe have their separate orbits. That is, they all move in very precisely computed paths. This scientific truth that scientists have only recently uncovered was revealed 1,400 years ago:   It is He Who created the night and the day, and the sun and the moon. They swim along, each in an orbit. (Surat al-Anbiya: 33)  As is also seen in this verse, Allah informs us about a scientific fact which was only discovered recently. At the time the Qur'an was revealed, people did not know that heavenly bodies moved in constant orbits. But Allah knows everything and tells what He wills to His slaves.   The Roundness of the Earth  The understanding of astronomy of the time, when the Qur'an was revealed, perceived the world differently. It was then thought by some that the earth was flat, and others had different theories. But the fact that the earth was round was not then generally known. However, from the Qur'an it was understood by implication that the shape of the world is round. The relevant verse reads:   He has created the Heavens and the Earth for Truth. He wraps the night up in the day, and wraps the day up in the nightâ€¦ (Surat az-Zumar: 5)   The Arabic word ""takwir"" is translated as ""to wrap"" in the above verse. In English it means ""to make one thing lap over another, folded up as a garment that is laid away."" The day and the night wrapping over each other can be true only if the earth is round. But, as mentioned above, the Arabs who lived 1,400 years ago thought that the earth was flat. This means that the roundness of the world was hinted at in the Qur'an, which was revealed in the seventh century. That is because Allah teaches the truth to mankind. This matter, indicated in the Book revealed by Allah, was verified only centuries later by scientists.   Since the Qur'an is Allah's word, the most correct words were used in it when describing the universe. It is unlikely that a human could know and choose these words. But because Allah knows everything, He can make these facts available to man at any time He wills.   "

300,3358293,"19,May,2004",2004-05-19,"   A week ago I was laying in bed and heard a ""pop-pop"" my knee felt like a rubber band being stretched as far as it would go then being snapped. I tried to buy a ghetto brace from Krogers and deal with the pain so I wouldn't have to go to the doctors again. Last Friday the pain got to the place I couldn't take it. My knee was making a crunching/grinding noise not the normal cracking I hear from my arthritis. So Saturday I send countless hours at the ER. They do x-rays and say nothing is broke. Damn it took a bunch of x-rays to tell you that? I need to become a doctor! I stated over and over again I didn't twist it and I could move it. So the doctor plays with my knee for a while scratches his head and says I think you might have torn ligaments and cartilage. So he dx me with internal derangement of the knee, gave me some pain pills, a brace which makes me have to hold my knee straight at all times and some crutches. He gave me a number to an orthopedic doctor to call and said to call them within the next ten days. So first thing Monday morning I called the number the ER had given me and they say you can't make this appointment you family doctor has to call us first and refer you. I made the mistake of thinking this might be easy! So I had to see my family doctor. He plays around with my knee for a while and says he agrees with the ER and wants me to get an MRI then he will call an orthopedic doctor for me. In the mean time I am suppose to keep the God awful brace on and continue to use the crutches. So tomorrow I go for my MRI. In the meantime I have had this stupid brace on my leg which has a steel plate down the back so I can't bend my knee so now when I try to bend my leg I can't at all. So no matter what the original problem was I will end up having to do physical therapy to get my leg working. I know I won't get the MRI results until mid next week so I'm really frustrated right now. There's not much I can do with this brace on. The pain sucks but I try to work through it. My fear is I will have to get surgery and I am not looking forward to the at all. I think ""the wolf"" has me pinned down for now but soon I will be back on my feet and kick his ass!  The Lupus scares me a little more everyday. I am 26 looking at knee surgery because of it. I am in a support group and I hear all the stories of the woman in the group. Most of them have had countless kindney problems and many have had kidney transplants. I don't like to spend to much time thinking about my Lupus but somedays I do get stuck in fear of what next. I don't fear death for myself but I don't want my kids to grow up without me. I don't want to be a burden to my family and I often feel that way already. I take pride in doing things on my own and not depending on anyone but every year it seems I become more dependent on those around me. Whether it's for someone to open a jar or for someone to carry things down the stairs because for that day my body isn't working. I hate the fact that some days I just can't do things normal people do. I push myself as far as I can but sometimes my body won't do what I tell it to do. I understand it could be worse but these are my pains I know no worse pain then what I am feeling. To not be able to go out a toss a ball with my son or not be able to brush my daughters hair because my hands hurt doesn't seem fair to my kids.  "
301,3358293,"19,May,2004",2004-05-19,"   So much time spent on things that don't matter, so much time spent on others. We don't take the time to care anymore. We don't take the time to love anymore. I lost you a long time ago but it took me this long to see it. All these years just a faded memory. Why are we still here? Is it because once in a while we get that old feeling back? For the kids? Maybe because it has become comfortable...  My heart is still in your hands but your mind has drifted. You don't look at me the same. You are too busy to notice. Maybe my health has turned you away from me. Maybe the years have made us change so that we can't find common ground anymore.   I'm tired of being that painting on the wall you notice from time to time. I'm tired of being in the same room with you but still alone. I'm tired of feeling nothing. I miss the passion. I miss the friendship. I miss the butterflys I use to get when you kissed me. I miss the way you use to look at me.  You pour your heart out to others but have nothing to say to me. You stay up all hours of the night with your buddies but it's lights out at nine with me. You are closer to people you have never met then you are to me. You don't even know who I am anymore. I bet I could ask questions about your online buddies and you would know all the answers. Do you even know of my dreams? Do you know my fears? Do you know anything about me anymore? Do you even care?   So many times we said forever but now that seems so far away. I'm not sure I see forever anymore. I can't live my life like this. I can't beg you to love me. I can't beg for you attention. I want you to love me. I want you to want me. I want you to notice me but not because I asked you to.  So where do I go from here? What is best for the kids? What is best for me? What is best for you?  Maybe you would rather not having me around? Maybe I add too much stress to your life? Maybe we just got lazy? Maybe we figured we would always be here for each other so we don't have to work at it? Maybe we have taken each other for granted? Maybe we just don't care anymore? Maybe we don't think we deserve any better? Maybe love isn't forever?  "
302,3358293,"19,May,2004",2004-05-19,   I am mom I am wife I am a homemaker At times I feel very useless At times I feel nothing To many people think if you donâ€™t bring home a pay check you donâ€™t work To many people think if you donâ€™t have a 9 to 5 you are lazy Where is my life going? What will I become? I had many dreams I had many plans Now I dream of nothing Now I donâ€™t make any plans I am only a mom I am only a wife I am only a homemaker  
303,3358293,"09,June,2004",2004-06-09,   So my dad calls today to let me know my Grandma's sister died. She had bone cancer and I know she's better off. So knowing this makes it all better right? No not really. Growing up me my brother and sister were the poor white trash of the family. Everyone knew what an asshole my dad was so either people took pity on us or wanted nothing to do with us. There were few people who gave a shit. Opal (my grandma's sister) was one of those people who cared for us not out of pity but just because she had a good heart. She also took great care of my grandma. So she was old and full of cancer so I should buck up and be happy that she's gone I guess...Most of my pain is for my Grandma she is about the only one left from her family and the years are getting to her. She feels very alone and I can't handle seeing my grandma in pain and I know I have to stay strong for her this weekend while we bury her sister. My grandparents are the world to me and I know their time is coming. I've lost many people but my grandparents were my hope when I was a kid they are the ones who taught me about love. Before Steve and the kids it was only my grandparents. Now my life is full of love but I know some of that love will be taken away soon.  I know I will have to see my dad for the funeral. People always say to leave the past behind you. I try everyday to do this. I get sick just looking at my dad or hearing his voice. I start to feel sick to my stomach and end up with a headache. I would love to find forgiveness in my heart for him but he doesn't want it. He won't own up for the times he knocked around my mom. He won't own up for all the hate he gave us kids. Most of the time people who don't understand baggage have never had any of their own. I love people who have no clue what we went through say I should let it go and move on with my life. I have moved on with my life but the drama from my childhood will always be there with me. It reminds me to never let myself turn into the asshole my dad is. I know the pain a parent who doesn't love their child can bring so I make sure my kids know everyday I love them. Every time I see or talk to my dad my past and present meets. There's no moving on or shoving it aside it is there and I have to deal with it for the moment then when I see him in anther six months I deal with it again.   My leg is still hurting me. I go to the orthopedic doctor next week. It looks like I'm heading towards surgery. All my ligaments in my knee are torn apart. So I'll either get some plastic in my knee or parts off a dead person. Kind of weird to think about having a dead persons body parts. I just want it over all ready I am sick of the waiting game.  So today is a shitty day. The good thing is there's only so much shit that happens before good things start to happen so soon my ship should come in right?

Nothing out of the ordinary happened...besides the ""dead people"" walking around school today...that kinda bummed and creeped me out at the same time. Erika came over after school and we played a little volleyball-type thing with my sister with my giant red bouncy ball. It's amazing how many times we let the ball roll into the street before we realized that if we moved higher into the lawn that that probably wouldn't happen...lol. I decided to take a shot at asking my mom if I could drive around the neighborhood with Erika. That was a big NO. haha. Later, Jenn came and picked us up and we went to Jay Gees and got some ice cream. I got vanilla soft serve with extra gummi bears on top lol...lets just say i ate all the gummi bears and none of the ice cream...cuz thats how i do yo. lol There is officially 3 days until the Kiss Concert :)It's gonna be so much fun. I'm planning on meeting Maroon 5, The Calling, Jessica Simpson, Kimberly Locke, and possibly Avril Lavigne...cuz i'm curious to see if she really is a bitch. lol I'm pretty upset that Simple Plan isn't gonna be there this year...but I guess I can deal.

Well, I just walked to my uncle's house from the orthodontist. Guess who gets their braces off next month? :)if u said Stephanie..ur riiight! I swear to God a tear fell down my cheek and i just got THE biggest smile on my face when he ever told me. lolol Today we had the English MCAS at school which was incredibly easily. The only thing I'm worried about is Math. I sucked and 1/2 at Math this year. Geometry sucks...bring on the Algebra! lol This week, they put me on the schedule for work on Monday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. And figures, the first Saturday they put me on, I can't work cuz I have the Kiss 108 Concert :). So now i'm panicking to find someone to take my hours...which seems to be impossible. So I think I'm just gonna go sometime today to tell the guy that I can't come in. And thats the end of my story...I'm off to listen to some Maroon 5...gonna see them on Saturday :)   "
6313,3371255,"17,May,2004",2004-05-17,"   I'm White...and I've been the victim of rascism...hmmm There are these black kids at my school...yeah, they think they are better than all white people...rascist, hypocritical dipshits... This is sad. I know I never owned a slave...and I'm pretty sure that they were never slaves(if they were...they're pretty old for Freshmen...), so their argument MUST be based on  anscestrial heritage... Let ALL know, even before the civil war, only 10% of the white people owned slaves...and none after the war. My family imigrated durring the 50's...and by their suposed logic, this statement must make perfect sence. I am part Jewish. I am also part German. Does this mean that my anscestors were Nazis, and treated my anscestors horribly, and  as such I should hate myself for my anscestors treatment of...themselves? No, this makes no sence, and I find that these...honestly I can't think of a word to call them... are just trying to get an advantage rom their fore-father's strife. And as we all know, the Africans wouldn't even think about selling their brethren into slavery... the Europeans just swept over and conquored the place... I hate people sometimes ... they can be stupid, and naustalgic. And another thing, why is it considered rascist for me to say the ""N"" word, but they can call me a ""Cracker"" all they want? GOD!!! It just doesn't make ANY SENCE!!! You know, there was a guy who was walking in the Bronx at night with his friend, when two black guys woth knives started walking towards him. His buddy, the smart one, ran. He, however, felt it would be rascist if he ran. His body was found in a dumpster, behind a bar. Funny...  "
6314,3371255,"17,May,2004",2004-05-17,"   I find it Ironic that our society is willing to accept blame for the ills of the world...and from those who poison it! If you have ever been on the west coast of the US, you will find that many of the people actually SIDE WITH THE TERRORISTS! WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU THINKING?????? If I came up to someone, and punched them in the face, would they blame themselves? NO! They would punch me right back! You know there are SERIOUS problems with a society when they feel that they are to blame for EVERY LITTLE THING! 2 1/2 years ago, we had a 2 planes fly into the World Trade Center...killing 3000+ people, and now, all we can think about is a few ""Tortured"" Iraqi soldiers? As I recall, those who died in the Trade Center were not exactly beligerant...they were TRADING. but let's not even mention the men and women in the towers, crying out in vain as fire consumes them, or those who jumped out from 80+ stories onto the pavement to escape such a fate... let's talk about 3 ENEMY SOLDIERS who were ""discrased""...and ofcourse they were never planning to bomb our military bases in Iraq, never ever ever ever trying to KILL our troops...My thinking is, if you are going to attempt to attack those who are liberating you, then you had better be ready to face the consequences. Let my rant be a lesson to society... for many of the ills in the world, we are not to blame. We are the ones who prevent the ills of the world...or at the least TRY to.           *cough*France,Germany*cough* Grrr...  "

13968,3372184,"20,May,2004",2004-05-20,"   My sister gave me a copy of  urlLink A Fine Balance  for my birthday and nearly three months later I'm finally finished reading it (I kept stopping to color in the pictures). So here's my review:  In the book, one of Rohintin Mistry's characters, Vasantrao Valmik, says:  ""You see, you cannot draw lines and compartments, and refuse to budge beyond them. Sometimes you have to use your failures as stepping-stoens to success.  You have to maintain a fine balance between hope and despair .""  Well there's far too much despair and not a bit of hope in the book. And when the characters try to use their failures as stepping-stones, their hopes are equally dashed. In fact, it seems the book should be titled after the main characters mantra,""Everything Ends Badly.""  Mistry is an excellent author and over the course of 500 pages he introduces you to more than a dozen detailed characters and makes you feel for all of them from a place deep in your heart. In fact, I was nearly late for work yesterday, because I had to finish the last 50 pages of the book before I got ready. But it turns out Mistry is a con-man, expertly pulling our heartstrings, then clipping them one by one.  If you like Dickens, you'll feel very comfortable with Mistry, but David Copperfield seems like a bedtime story compared to this tragic train wreck. If Mistry had left even a sliver of hope, a half-twisted grin on one of the characters faces, a twinkle in their eye instead of a tear, I would have put the book down satisfied. Instead, I felt forlorn, grief-struck and spiritually and emotionally demolished.  Of course, that's probably Mistry's goal: to make you feel the sense of desperation and hopelessness that pervades Indian life. His scathing political rebuke of Indira Ganhi's term as Prime Minister was an eye-opener to my unschooled mind and his harsh social commentary rung true to scenes I recall from my travels in India in 1995. But a picture of a gray horizon, no matter how masterfully painted, is not a masterpiece in my eyes, unless there is a hint of a coming break in the storm.  "
13969,3372184,"20,May,2004",2004-05-20,"   Having wi-fi internet access has changed my life. Maybe that's oversimplifying or maybe I just was that stagnant. Anyway, as a music freak, I've really taken on to streaming internet radio.   The two best sites I've found are  urlLink 91X  and  urlLink WNRN    I grew up listening to 91X in San Diego and I've never found another alternative/modern rock station that's quite as good. The DJs know their stuff. They play a good mix of old, new, hard and softer stuff, plus they play a lot of independent and local music as well. My only complaint about their streaming radio is the commercial breaks get tedious because they have generic filler music during local ads.  I just discovered WNRN last year. I was driving from Roanoke to Washington DC and surfing the radio when I found this station playing great songs one after another, after another. And it wasn't the same cheesy stuff on most other stations, it was stuff I hadn't heard in a while (or had never heard at all). I think this is where I heard ""Do You Realize?"" for the first time. The station turned me on to the Flaming Lips and for that I am forever in their debt.  The best part of WNRN is their a public station, so they never have commercials (though the DJ will throw in a plug from time to time). And it's not all rock. The Boom Box plays a great mix of rap and hip-op at nights. Check it out. I see that their Board of Directors is considering getting rid of the audio stream so log on and  urlLink tell them to keep the audio stream    Enjoy!  "
13970,3372184,"18,May,2004",2004-05-18,"   I managed to waste my days off fooling around on this Interweb. Among the more entertaining things I've seen is the  urlLink Sitepal  service, where you type something and can see and here a cartoon say it. Just click on the link, then click ""try now"" and then click ""add audio."" Enjoy!  I also have been catching up with old friends and found out that not one, but two old college classmates are now engaged. To Marcus and Whitney, congratulation, you've officially made me feel old and unwanted. Truly, I am really happy for them both. It's very exciting, but it is weird.  With Whitney I got that same feeling I had back at my college graduation. Where you realize that this particular moment a chapter in your life is completely and fully wrapping up. It's happiness, but bittersweet, because of it's immense finality.  With Marcus it was just a reminder that the old college days are indeed past. That the guys hanging out, will not be the same, because now there are significant others. But I hope it will be ""the more the merrier.""  "

I'm beginning my fifth incarnation.... a new life, in a new city with a new job and a new chance to make friends, prove myself and take the world by storm.... plus I now have wi-fi internet service and a laptop.  See life, like a book is made up of chapters.

13972,3372184,"15,June,2004",2004-06-15,"   Do you ever watch ""The Simpsons?"" Do you know that character who plays the flamboyant moustached clerk and always over-stresses the word ""Yes?"" Who is that guy?  Well it turns out he's based on an old character actor named  urlLink Frank Nelson . Nelson acted in a ton of TV shows ranging from I Love Lucy to Sanford and Son and was known for that odd effeminate overpronunciation of the word ""yes."" Why would such a random icon have such a recurring role on ""The Simpsons?""  Well it turns out the actual Frank Nelson had a recurring role as a clerk in another TV cartoon family: none other than ""The Flintsones.""  Apparently some believe the character is based on Vincent Price, but that makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. Others say Hal Perry, but I don't know who that is and a google search turns up nothing.  "

First where to start is the biggest problem we faced.  Actually you learn a lot in maintenance, but it was all in the negative. Every problem you faced was caused by a failure of the old code to prevent problems during maintenance. But this doesn't always teach you how to write good, new code that avoids such issues. Your entire thought process only reacts to the events it becomes difficult to visualize the big picture in just one short and come up with some design architecture.  But for new development, we need to sit down and consider -how- we intends to build the application, rather than focusing in on how to structure specific features. "

2168,3374253,"01,July,2004",2004-07-01,"    Somebody just forwarded this mail...  10 Ways of Marrying The Wrong Personby Rabbi Dov Heller, M.A. 1. You pick the wrong person because you expect him/her to change after you're married. The classic mistake: Never marry potential. The golden rule is, if you can't be happy with the person the way he or she is now, don't get married. As a colleague of mine so wisely put it, ""You actually can expect people to change after they're married... for the worst!"" So when it comes to the other person's spirituality, character, personal hygiene, communication skills, and personal habits, make sure you can live with these as they are now.  2. You pick the wrong person because you focus more on chemistry than on character. Chemistry ignites the fire, but good character keeps it burning. Beware of the ""I'm in love"" syndrome. ""I'm in love"" often means, ""I'm in lust."" Attraction is there, but have you carefully checked out this person's character? Here are four character traits to definitely check for:  Humility: Does this person believe that ""doing the right thing"" is more important than personal comfort? Do I want to be more like this person? Would I like my child to turn out like him or her?  Kindness: Does this person enjoy giving pleasure to other people? How does s/he treat people s/he doesn't have to be nice to? Does s/he do volunteer work? Give charity?  Responsibility: Can I depend on this person to do what s/he says s/he's going to do?  Happiness: Does this person like himself? Does s/he enjoy life? Is s/he emotionally stable? Ask yourself: Do I want to be more like this person? Do I want to have a child with this person? Would I like my child to turn out like him or her?  3. You pick the wrong person because the man doesn't understand what a woman needs most. Men and women have unique emotional needs, and more often than not, it is the man who just doesn't ""get it."" Jewish tradition places the onus on the man to understand the emotional needs of a woman and to satisfy them. The unique need of a woman is to be loved -- to feel that she is the most important person in her husband's life. The husband needs to give her consistent, quality attention. This is most apparent in Judaism's approach to sexual intimacy. The Torah obligates the husband to meet the sexual needs of his wife. Sexual intimacy is always on the woman's terms. Men are goal-oriented, especially when it comes to this area. As a wise woman once pointed out, ""Men have two speeds: on and off."" Women are experience-oriented. When a man is able to switch gears and become more experience-oriented, he will discover what makes his wife very happy. When the man forgets about his own needs and focuses on giving his wife pleasure, amazing things happen.  4. You choose the wrong person because you do not share a common life goals and priorities. There are three basic ways we connect with another person:  -chemistry and compatibility -share common interests -share common life goal  Make sure you share the deeper level of connection that sharing life goals provide. After marriage, the two of you will either grow together or grow apart. To avoid growing apart, you must figure out what you're ""living for,"" while you're single -- and then find someone who has come to the same conclusion as you. This is the true definition of a ""soul mate."" A soul mate is a goal mate -- two people who ultimately share the same understanding of life's purpose and therefore share the same priorities, values and goals.  5. You choose the wrong person because you get involved sexually too quickly. Sexual involvement before the commitment of marriage can be a big problem because it often precludes a fully honest exploration of important issues. Sexual involvement tends to cloud one's mind. And a clouded mind is not inclined to make good decisions. Of all the studies done on divorce, sexual incompatibility is never cited as a main factor. It is not necessary to take a ""test drive"" in order to find out if a couple is sexually compatible. If you do your homework and make sure you are intellectually and emotionally compatible, you don't have to worry about sexualcompatibility. Of all the studies done on divorce, sexual incompatibility is never citedas a main reason why people divorce.  6. You pick the wrong person because you do not have a deeper emotional connection with this person. To evaluate whether you have a deeper emotional connection or not, ask: ""Do I respect and admire this person?"" This does not mean, ""Am I impressed by this person?"" We are impressed by a Mercedes. We do not respect someone because they own a Mercedes. You should be impressed by qualities of creativity, loyalty, determination, etc. Also ask: ""Do I trust this person?"" This also means, ""Is he/she emotionally stable? Do I feel I can rely on him/her?  7. You pick the wrong person because you choose someone with whom you don't feel emotionally safe. Ask yourself the following questions: Do I feel calm, peaceful and relaxed with this person? Can I fully express myself with this person? Does this person make me feel good about myself? Do you have a really close friend who does make you feel this way? Make sure the person you marry makes you feel the same way! Are you afraid of this person in any way? You should not feel you need to monitor what you say because you are afraid of how the other person will view it. If you're afraid to express your feelings and opinions openly, there's a problem with the relationship. Be on the look out for someone who is always trying to change you. Another aspect of feeling safe is that you don't feel the other person is trying to control you. Controlling behaviors are a sign of an abusive person. Be on the look out for someone who is always trying to change you. There's a big difference between ""controlling"" and ""making suggestions."" A suggestion is made for your benefit; a control statement is made for their benefit.  8. You pick the wrong person because you don't put everything on the table. Anything that bothers you about the relationship must be brought up for discussion. Bringing up the uncomfortable stuff is the only way. To evaluate how well the two of you communicate, negotiate, and work together. Over the course of a lifetime, difficulties will inevitably arise. You need to know now, before making a commitment: Can you resolve your differences and find compromises that work for both of you? Never be afraid to let the person know what bothers you. This is also a way for you to test how vulnerable you can be with this person. If you can't be vulnerable, then you can't be intimate. The two go hand in hand.  9. You pick the wrong person because you use the relationship to escape from personal problems and unhappiness. If you are unhappy and single,you'll probably be unhappy and married, too. Marriage does not fix personal, psychological and emotional problems. If anything, marriage will exacerbate them. If you are not happy with yourself and your life, take responsibility to fix it now while you are single. You'll feel better, and your future spouse will thank you.  10. You pick the wrong person because he/she is involved in a triangle. To be ""triangulated"" means a person is emotionally dependent on someone or something else while trying to develop another relationship. A person who hasn't separated from his or her parents is the classic example of triangulation. People can also be triangulated with things as well, such as work, drugs, Internet, hobbies, sports or money. Be careful that you and your partner are free of triangles. The person caught in the triangle cannot be fully emotionally available to you. You will not be their number one priority. And that's no basis for a marriage.   "

14526,3376440,"18,May,2004",2004-05-18,"   While Caribbean broadcasters shut down their Medium Wave (AM) radio transmitters one by one, reports of the death of AM in the United States, whose economy we ape, are greatly exaggerated... AM RADIO YESTERDAY, TODAY, AND TOMORROW   Every day, Americans spend more time with radio than TV or newspapers. Radio is everywhere. If you want to buy a car without a radio youâ€™ll have to special-order it. Talk is radioâ€™s most-listened-to, most Sales-opportune format. For 30 years in this industry, Iâ€™ve had lots of fun, worked real hard, and made a great living. But radio isnâ€™t all I do. Iâ€™m also in retail, and am myself a radio advertiser. Iâ€™m a big, big fan.   Every industry is changing. Like airlines, banks, and the family farm, life is very different in radio today than it was â€œwhen we got into the business.â€ And we can already see that radio will change even more in the near future than it has in the recent past. Itâ€™s human nature to dread change, but I am very optimistic about radioâ€™s future.   What wonâ€™t change is whoâ€™s winning. Itâ€™s been said that if the government confiscated all wealth and issued every American the same amount in new currency, the same people would end up rich and broke a year later. Radioâ€™s winners will continue to be the stations that are most alert and resourceful, that have the most fun, in short, those that care. Places where employees high-five each other when something great comes out the speaker.   When Marty Riemenschneider invited me to speak at this convention, I asked him what I could say that would have the most value. He sent me some specific questions, and Iâ€™ll give you specific answers. But what kind of consultant would I be without explaining â€œthe latest trends?â€ So first, The Big Pictureâ€¦   Yesterdayâ€¦   Music on FM was either Percy Faith or Buffalo Springfield, music on AM was everything in-between.   Double-digit shares were common. There were fewer radio stations, and fewer other competitors for Time-Spent-Listening, as the Internet and hundreds of TV channels have become today.   Other than Paul Harvey, most of what you heard originated locally. This was a very redundant industry. There were always a half-dozen young men sitting between two turntables, even in medium markets like Springfield, Massachusetts, where I grew up.  Still, it was a buyerâ€™s market for help. Even with Viet Nam draining the demographic that produced most radio talent, there were more applicants than on-air jobs. Talent felt lucky to be working, and management often treated them accordingly.   Stations with the highest ratings usually got most of the radio ad dollars.   The Internet was â€œthe future.â€   Todayâ€¦   Listeners think of FM as music radio, AM as non-music radio.   Super-successful stations have single-digit shares. The aggregate cume of many clusters is now greater than the declining circulation of the metropolitan newspaper, though print rates still dwarf radioâ€™s.   As self-serving as the following observation sounds coming from a vendor who sells systems, this historic deregulation has endowed owners with more stations than they have the think-time to manage. And itâ€™s typical for more attention and resources to be allocated to defending topped-out music FM shares than to growing AM shares that are sooooooooooooooo much more Sales-friendly.   Most of the programming on non-music AMs comes from another city, and lots of it has franchise value. But at any given moment, there are no human beings in AM control rooms, even in big markets. I knew that The Talk Radio Revolution was over when visiting a client station and seeing them learn that one of their AMs was off-the-air only when a concerned listener phoned the switchboard.   Recently, some AMs who talk-the-talk about being the marketâ€™s information button failed to walk-the-walk when weekend how-to shows went uninterrupted by live coverage of the John Kennedy missing plane story. Station-in-a-box just chugged on.   The dark side of an 11,000 Dow is that service has deteriorated in a sellerâ€™s market for help. As a consumer, you suffer this every day, when receptionists who ask you to hold disconnect youâ€¦or you stand at a retail counter waiting to be waited on while employees chat with each other. Radioâ€™s version of this is the uninformed Talk host, or the local newscaster reading the newspaper on-air and telling you what happened yesterday. Want to stand out from the other stations? Act like Nordstrom! Over-deliver! Hire a great receptionist! After all, this person is responsible for 99% of your stationâ€™s off-air PR.   With so many mediocre career radio performers lowering the bar, some of the biggest on-air salaries now go to people who havenâ€™t spent their lives on-air. Before becoming Minnesota Governor, Jesse Ventura parlayed his wrestling persona into a Minneapolis morning show; and WJR/Detroitâ€™s Mitch Albom and WRKO/Bostonâ€™s Howie Carr established themselves in other local media before hosting their successful afternoon shows. Are there â€œreal peopleâ€ in your market who should be on your air?   Two consultant buzzwords youâ€™ll be hearing a lot are â€œrepurposingâ€ and â€œconvergence.â€   Example of repurposing: That gardening show is only on your air 2 hours on Sunday morning. Why must that be the only time you make gardening information available? How about reiterating your expertâ€™s shtick as a point-and-click menu of gardening topics on your stationâ€™s web siteâ€¦sponsored by your local advertiserâ€¦and paid for by their national co-op or vendor bucks?  Examples of convergence: ABCâ€™s NFL Monday Night Football Pre-Game Show from originated from Baltimoreâ€™s ESPNZone restaurant. In the process, several Disney-owned brands and assets cross-promoted each other. Dr. Laura plugs a catalog of â€œNow Go Take On The Dayâ€ sportswear; and rather than giving away cheap T-shirts, smart stations sell high-end logoâ€™d denim shirts.   The Internet is no longer â€œthe future.â€ Though most stations donâ€™t yet make real money on-line, many GMs will soon awake in a cold sweat realizing that they canâ€™t meet Melâ€™s goals without this revenue stream. Rather than the station web site being a distraction or sideline, smart stations make it someoneâ€™s job.   Converge your on-air and on-line programming, and dollars will follow. Example: The day after the USA women won that World Cup soccer game, America Online was polling members:   Why do you think Brandi Chastain took off her shirt?  To show off her fabulous abs  To get a sports-bra endorsement  She was hot  Male athletes do it, why shouldnâ€™t she?  As one of the worldâ€™s best soccer players, she was celebrating an amazing victory.  Do that on your web site. Put a client ad panel on that page and name the poll after the client.  Lots of stations are still peddling dots-and-spots, bidding-down the value of inventory by selling against other stations to â€œget on the buyâ€ made by agency radio buyers who are too young to understand AM radio. But if you remember one thing from this whole rant, itâ€™s the mantra I chant to my client stations, and it applies to both Programming and Sales: Do what only you can do.   View Programming this way, and youâ€™ll exploit the value in your franchises, like play-by-playâ€¦or Rush Limbaughâ€¦ or being the marketâ€™s Weather Channel radio affiliate. â€œNOW YOU CAN GET THE LATEST WEATHER CHANNEL FORECAST EVEN WHEN YOUâ€™RE IN THE CARâ€¦OR IF YOU DONâ€™T HAVE CABLE!â€   Ditto for Sales: When I managed USA TODAY Sky Radio, we created avails with a unique listener profile: business travelers listening live aboard Delta, United, and Northwest Airlines. Those spots werenâ€™t shotguns, they were laser beams. But what got us the Toyota Avalon buy was our value-added: We included an ad panel on the monthly Sky Radio play-by-play schedule you found on your meal tray. This is what cops call â€œaccess to restricted areas.â€ What doors can you open for advertisers?   Tomorrowâ€¦   AM stations that feel lesser than FMs today will get the last laugh in the digital future, when In-Band-On-Channel multiplexing turns WXXX into WXXX1, WXXX2, WXXX3, WXXX4, etc. Itâ€™ll take a few years for new receivers to proliferate, as with UHF TV. But when it does, AM will sound as good as FM, and can offer Americans whose lives keep getting faster and faster just what they wantâ€¦instant gratification.   Some TV stations have already shown us how, swapping Retransmission Consent rights for a second cable channel they use to constantly replay newscasts, or show logoâ€™d weather graphics. So radio, which will always be the #1 in-car medium, and AM (the information band), will be even more handy and relevant to busy people. While Rush is pontificating on WXXX1, you can be constantly playing and updating your Weather Channel forecast on WXXX2; with neither interrupted by the afternoon baseball game on WXXX3, or the replay of that great interview your morning show had earlier when many listeners might not have been tuned in.   Build key images and encumber programming franchises now, and youâ€™ll be known for them later.   And the answers to your specific questions areâ€¦   Q: â€œ3 person morning shows: a good idea?â€  A: Hard to generalize, since opportunities vary locally. One advantage of an ensemble: separate vacations. With only one person gone at a time, youâ€™ve never got the â€œBâ€ team subbing.   Q: â€œWhat to pay on-air people?â€ and â€œGood incentive/bonus plans for on-air people?â€  A: Peg rewards to Sales rather than ratings results. Example: a smart GSM I know preps for a new business pitch by inviting all on-air people to submit spec spots. Then, rather than asking the prospect yes-or-no, the AE asks which spot works best. And the winning talent gets a cash award. Some stations pay talent a small fee for live spots, or a bonus for new accounts renewing. Results can be dramatic.   Q: â€œAre we playing too many commercials today?â€  A: Read The Impact of Higher Spot Loads on Radio Listeners, FREE at www.EdisonResearch.com   Q: â€œWhat other incentives do you recommend, other than money?â€  A: Whatever you award is most meaningful when itâ€™s recognized as an award, rather than simply an entitlement. But what gratifies on-air people most is so obvious you might overlook it: listen to them. Hey, they talk for a living! Bring them into brainstorming meetings that they otherwise feel left out of. Even if you donâ€™t do everything they suggest, theyâ€™ll feel very included; and youâ€™ll get better execution.   Q: â€œHow do you see AM radio competing against digital radio (i.e., XM, CD Radio, etc.)?â€  A: National media can never do what solid local radio can: be local.   Q: â€œHow will â€˜virtual radioâ€™ (radio on the Internet) impact us?  A: Cyber-surfers have already demonstrated that theyâ€™re not as interested in hearing distant broadcast stations as other on-line audio (i.e., the LAX tower talking to pilots). But thatâ€™s a novelty, compared to how day-to-days useful a hustling local station can be.   copyright 1999 Holland Cooke  "

Actually, they've become something of a reprieve, seeing as darling hubby and I usually work harder on the weekends than we do during the week.  My baby turns one today...*sniff sniff*  I don't know where the last year has gone.  One of the characters in Stephen King's Dark Tower series talks about how time is no longer passing at a steady pace - it is alternately speeding up and slowing down.  That's what it feels like to me - like time is just on fast forward these days.  The days are turning into weeks so quickly, I'm afraid to blink - I might lose a whole month.  I'm working on getting a webpage set up - I used to have one, a long time ago, but I quit working on it, and over the years I've forgotten what little HTML I did know.  So...I guess that's it for now - I'd better go see what the kids are doing.  They're being quiet, which usually means that they're into something that they shouldn't be into.  "

Well, they have decided that what they saw was ball lightning.  This kind of stuff fascinates me.  (One of my favorite sites is about.com's  urlLink paranormal  site - they have some information on ball lightning there)  I love reading about strange or unexplainable phenomena - ghosts, time travel, that kind of stuff.  I have always been fascinated by the occult...and I wish that I could say that I believe in ghosts, and all that stuff.  I really would like to believe...I guess that deep down, I'm not one to take anything on faith.   [Warning: Unpredictable Tangent Ahead]  I guess that explains why I am an atheist.  I was raised Catholic, but when I was about fourteen or so, I started to question...everything.  Some days I wish that I could be a mindless sheep, and just believe what I am told because I am told to.  I wish that I could believe that there was some supreme, omnipotent being watching out for me, taking care of me...but I can't.  It just doesn't make any sense.    ~sigh~  More on this later.

I feel so helpless - I wish I could just take it away.  I hate having to watch them lay around, all miserable.  But it's frustrating, too.  When they're sick, they want to be held and rocked and sung to...continuously.  Which is cool - I love to cuddle them and sing to them.  It just gets difficult when they all want to be held at the same time.  And then there's the fact that it's mighty hard to get any housework done when you have three children attached to you.  You know, they say that a clean house is a sign of unhappy children...if that's true, my kids must be the happiest kids on earth.    My husband is active duty military, and we had a very close brush with him getting deployed to Iraq last week.  I'm still kind of stressed over that.  It doesn't make it any easier that I have disagreed with the decision to go to war from the get go (and believe me, that caused it's fair share of fights here at home, as my darling hubby didn't feel the same way).  Of course, my opposition to the war has nothing whatsoever to do with my support of the military - it's not like they have a choice in the matter.  Now, Bush, on the other hand...well, I won't climb up on that soapbox right now.  It could get very long and ugly, and there's no telling how much longer the kids will be napping.  If anyone happens by here, and reads this, would you leave me a comment or send an email?  I'd love to know if anyone's actually listening to my rambling...that would be hella cool.  I can't even get people to listen to me ramble in my own house.  Of course, that's probably due to the fact that they've all heard my stories so many times that now, when I start to tell one, they just cut me off and say, ""Yep.  We've heard that one.""  "

I got ready and went to the conference room and I felt very tired. During the meeting JP shows up apparently he and Bruce and Robert (Bobby) were out till about 8am they went to three sisters and then got lost on the way back since there was such thick fog.

Once we got to the ship they took pictures of us for out ID cards (god I looked awful!) and got us checked in to our rooms we were then informed that we would have to leave the ship in two hours at 6pm since there was a black out. (I still haven't slept at this point) I check into my room get totally unpacked, moved in, and take a shower. I am on my bed counting my new monopoly money and Mohammad (the front desk guy) & Joe knock on my door and tell me that I have to change rooms and I only have 5 min to do it, since the ship is evacuating. So we run down the hall with my clothes draped over their arms (I am in heals) to my new room and I have to leave immediately to meet everyone out side. I forget to bring my ID and my jacket (lack of sleep). Now I have to figure out how to walk across a gangway riddled with holes in heals, lets just say I was getting laughed at and I hadnï¿½t even been visible for more than 5mins. I find out that we are going go-cart racing at an indoor track down the road. It is so cool when we get there (remember I am in heals). The track is pretty complicated with tunnels and bridges. We sign up for the race and I have to wear a very smelly jump suit and drive in high heels but somehow I manage to race pretty well. I am all hopped up on RedBull and ready to go. My highest score placed was 7th. I had a lot of fun waving at everyone while I was driving. I can't believe that they let us drink and drive (I love this country). We also had a barbeque that we got to cook our own meat on the grill.&nbsp; urlLink   "

17999,3389942,"30,May,2004",2004-05-30,"   Alright.  29th, Morning, I got up at 6:30 to get ready for the programming compitition. I got to algonquin at 7:30; Registration was between 8:15 and 9:00. At about 8:00 Kevin appeared at the window of the Optra (I was in the back with my laptop out and my music pumped up). I got out, and hung around with Kevin until Matt and Roland, the rest of our team, showed up. I also got to meet / hang out with John for a bit.  We eventually got in, registered, went to our room and started programming. the first 2 hours went well, we were laughing, having a good time. We even had the Carebears music pumped up [we were in a room with 2 other teams, too ^^]. After the first 2 hours we hit a little snag, and I totally just drowned out. I couldn't figure out what the problem was, and i just kind of shut down; didn't care anymore. After enough kicking I eventually took another look at it, then it was the lunch break.  I thought about it during lunch, and fixed the problem as soon as we got back into the lab. blah, blah, blah, stuff happens, and our entry is judged.  --> It didn't run the judges Map properly, the units were fucking up, everything was going wrong.  after the judge had marked our program [we didn't do well...], I was sent back to the main room to wait for judging to finish.  I looked at the schedule to see when judging was going to start, it was in 45 minutes, so I grabbed my keys, hopped in my car and went to see if Sarah wanted to come to algonquin for the judging.   When I pulled up to where her house is, she was in the car with her mom and her sister, and we both got out of our respective cars and had a little chat. turns out she was going to the mall, so I hopped back into my vehicle and drove off into the sunset- er, I mean, back to algonquin. wow, I'm tired.  alright, so I get back to algonquin, wait abit, final judging happens, Neither my team or Nick/John's team placed, but my team got Most Improved [A well deserved most improved, might I add].  After that I drove Kevin and Roland to Sarah's, got Sarah, and brought the whole crew to Compusmart to pick up some bawls. They had no _actual_ 24's left, so they made one with a 12 pack, 12 individuals and a big, brown cardboard box.  We went back to my house, and watched spiderman until everyone arrived.  the party was pretty sweet, I had a really good time. We watched spiderman, played music & socialised, watched flash movies, played videogames, and everyone seemed to be having a really good time.   Sarah went and sat in the corner at one point, but later on she ended up talking to Patrick for awhile, which was pretty cool. I don't think she would have enjoyed herself as much if he wasn't there.   Patrick is really cool, I mean, he's in grade 8, but I respect him more than most of my friends that are my age. I don't even see him as younger then me, it just doesn't register that way in my head. Quite the awesome guy.   I spent most of the time running around doing everything and talking to everyone... I had _lots_ of bawls.   Brent and Sam went on a walk at some point, and Sarah kept suggesting the idea that they were in my room. :s. that wouldn't be cool. I would have to sleep on the floor if that happend.  Roland and Kevin were the two huge nerds that they are; Roland said nothing and Kevin spent the whole time on the computer. Alan just sat there and played his guitar, but I'm sure he has other things on his mind anyway [He just started going out with Rachel ^^, thats soo cool, i'm happy for him, Rachels cool (alot cooler then his Grade 10 female friend {Who was apparently mad when he got a gf, even though she said he should date other people   } ) ].  and... that was that.  then, the next day, my birthday, I got Kill Bill, The Billy Talent CD, and a trampoline.  And worked on my anthro summative all day.  fun stuff,,, guh.  i'm going to die tomorrow from sleep deprivation, I'm still not done my anthro summative, I want to see Sarah as soon as possible (i always want to see Sarah as soon as possible, though, so thats not really somthing new), and I probably have to work on tuesday (just to spite me, so I can't invite Sarah over and I have to wait until wednesday).

18000,3389942,"28,May,2004",2004-05-28,"   Anyway,  Alright. I have my Anthro Summative, with a drop dead due date of Tuesday [I'm certain I can get it done by then], My physics summative is due at some point next week, the programming compition is... tomorrow, along with my party.  Fun stuff.  I feel bad in antrho, because I didn't do my homework for chapters 3,4,5,6, or 7... so I need to get those done. I figure I'll work on them after the summative is over with.  I'm in computer Engineering now... I drove to school today, in the Optra, so I have my incubus mix CD, I brought it in, and its playing over the speakers in the computer engineering room right now :).  ""Whatever Tomorrow Brings, i'll be there"",  --Drive, by Incubus  Just heard that. I guess it applies right now, I can get all this stuff done, I can win that compition, I can get through the rest of this school year.  Out of everything going on tomorrow, I'm really just looking forward to seeing Sarah the most. I love being around her, being with her, randomly talking about absolutly nothing, or having a conversation about somthing serious, its awesome.  ""Its all been said, with the exeption for the right part... when will we be new skin?"", --New Skin, by Incubus  What else is going on... Oh, Wilfrid Laurier University offers a 5 year program in which you get both a Bachelors in Computer Science AND a Bachelors in Buisness, which would be _exactly_ what i'm lookinf for.  I'm still going with the idea that I want to take over the dealership, and in order to do so, I would have to get my degree (4 or 5 years), then spend 5 to 7 years working at the dealership before I could apply to become an official Licensed GM dealer.

18004,3389942,"19,May,2004",2004-05-19,"   Alright,  I was in Physics class, and after the teacher finished the lesson, I sat back and started thinking.  I got this... somthing hit me. Not physically, no, an idea, or rahter, a path...  I don't know where it came from. I've wanted to be a programmer since I was 8 years old; i've been programming since I was 8 years old... but... While thinking about what I like to do, the aspects of my Job I enjoy, what I like to do while programming... I think I was _made_ to sell cars.  My brother Rob went through 4 years of Electrical Engineering at Queens University, and he now works at Ottawa Hydro; sure, he does random electrical engineering things, but want to know what the favourite part of his job is? Organizing meetings, networking with people, organzing and assigning people to do stuff; and he's good at it. enough so, thats pretty much what he does now... Thats what he would be doing as a car salesmen.  I really like working with computers, but all the mystery and appeal of working with them is gone; coding seems dry to me... but at my Job at the independant, i'm constantly talking to people; people who come through my cash usually come through again. I know a university professer, a women who owns her own construction company, a women who wants me to tutor her son programming... all these people who know me; even though I'm just a cashier at a grocery store.  I think I would really enjoy being a car salesmen. I think its what i'm built to do. And on top of that, the pay would be amazing, and I'd get tons of time off to persue other intrests [such as programming].  I scheduled a guidence appointment, and i'm going to talk to my dad about it, but yeah... nuts.   "

8796,3392887,"25,May,2004",2004-05-25,"    I am currently reading The Teachings of Don Juan: A Yaqui Way of Knowledge by Carlos Castaneda. So far the book is pretty good, my dad gave it to me and told me it was about how to become a physicist. At Fermi Lab right now I am surrounded by mostly people that have PhD's in physics or like me are graduate students in physics. All in all a pretty smart bunch of people. I tend to shy away from them, because in my head they are all smarter than me and never had any problems getting things to work like I do, so in fact, they are better, but are they? or are they just older and more experienced?  Tonight I read an interesting passage in the book that I thought I would pass along:       ""When a man starts to learn, he is never clear about his objectives. His purpose is faulty; his intent is vague. He hopes for rewards that will never materialize for he knows nothing of the hardships of learning.      ""He slowly begins to learn -bit by bit at first, then in big chunks. And his thoughts soon clash. What he learns is never what he pictured, or imagined, and so he begins to be afraid. Learning is never what one expects. Every step of learning is a new task and the fear the man is experiencing begins to mount mercilessly, unyieldingly. His purpose becomes a battlefield.       ""And thus he has stumpled upon the first of his natural enemies: Fear! A terrible enemy - treacherous, and difficult to overcome. It remains concealed at every turn of the way, prowling, waiting. And if the man, terrified in its presence, runs away, his enemy will have put an end to his quest.""       ""What will happen to the man if he runs away in fear?""       ""Nothing happens to him except that he will never learn. He will never become a man of knowledge. He will perhaps be a bully, or a harmless, scared man; at any rate, he will be a defeated man. His first enemy will have put an end to his cravings.""       ""And what can he do to overcome fear?""       ""The answer is very simple. He must not run away. He must defy his fear, and in spite of it he must take the next step in learning, and the next, and the next. He must be fully afraid, and yet he must not stop. That is the rule! And a moment will come when his first enemy retreats. The man begins to feel sure of himself. His intent becomes stronger. Learning is no longer a terrifying task.       ""When this joyful moment comes, the man can say ithout hesitation that he has defeated his first natural enemy.""       ""Does it happen at once, don Juan, or little by little?""       ""It happens little by little, and yet the fear is vanquished suddenly and fast.""       ""But won't the man be afraid again if something new happens to him?""       ""No. Once a man has vanquished fear, he is free from it for the rest of his life because, instead of fear, he has acquired clarity - a clarity of mind which erases fear. By then a man knows his desires; he knows how to satisfy those desires. He can anticipate the new steps of learning, and a sharp clarity surrounds everything. The man feels that nothing is concealed.""   Maybe we all get to a point where we are too scared to continue. For some this would probably happen much earlier in life. When I tell people that I am a physics graduate student they give me this look of terror and say things like, ""oh my god I could never do that,"" or ""you must be so smart"" I want to tell these people that no, I am really probably a lot like you I just get up every day, knowing that I am probably going to have difficulties in doing whatever it is I need to do that day. However, it always gets done, there is always people around to help....and there is always my goddamn Welty stubborness that keeps me trying. Who knows where I will end up, right now I am terrified of being here and what I am doing, but i am hoping that as the days and weeks go on I will gain some insight to what I am doing and become more comfortable with it.

8797,3392887,"21,May,2004",2004-05-21,"    Well here I am at Fermi Lab at 1:10 in the AM. My office is in the sub-sub basement...yes that's three stories beneath the ground. I am about 20 feet away from the D0 detector, which I know sounds cool....but really it's just a wall which I know the detector sits behind. Not only am I lucky enough to be below three levels of sunshine, my desk is in a huge cavern. So imagine a huge room with 3 story ceilings and then some desks thrown in the middle. Yowza! does it get better than this!   Anyways, looking at my schedule for the next week I have just planned to not sleep for many days. Jason and I are working these owl shifts this week and so our schedule is all screwed up. It's alright for now, but the end of the week brings meetings that are unfortunatly not at 3am.

8798,3392887,"21,May,2004",2004-05-21,"    What is the  definition of marriage?  Such a simple looking question but lately in this country is has gotten more and more complicated. Recently Massachusetts has allowed gay couples to marry. Listening to a morning radio show the other day which was discussing said topic, I was surprised by what many of  the  callers had to say. Their thought was that hey, I don't mind it, but you can't call it marriage because ""God said marriage is between a man and a woman"". But it's ok if it's a civil union. So my question to these people is what about all the straight people that get married a Justice of the Peace? Like me for example. For the rest of my life, should I refer to my future husband as my civil partner? If we are at a party will I give the following introduction, ""Hi, my name is Leah and this is my civil partner Jason"" ? Since we are not getting married in the church and are obviously beyond sinners by these peoples standards do they say the same thing about us as they would a gay couple?   My real question is...Now it's a good one :  HOW DOES IT AFFECT YOUR LIFE?  Seriously, how does the marriage of two men or two women do anything to you, your family, your children, your marriage etc?   I think that everyone in this country has a right to get married. And by married I mean married, not civil unioned.   "

However, come October we will back in the great city of Chicago. After a rather frustrating conversation at the Lab yesterday I got to thinking about why more of the grad students don't live in the city. Obviously there are a lot of issues to consider...money, commuting which of course involves traffic, city noise? Well I could go on and on and maybe my view is biased by the fact that I grew up in Chicago a couple of blocks from Wrigley Field so I can appreciate what the city can offer. I agree that it will be more expensive to live in the city due to higher rents, gas money food and so on. However, at the end of th day and on the weekends I get to say, ""But wait, I'm in the city."" The city has so much to offer. The city holds me in awe all by itself. I don't need to do anything to enjoy it, just being there calms me down. Then you add to that the amount of things to do, all the museums, bars, clubs, beaches, ball games, starbucks...wait those are everywhere. My point is that spending the bit of extra money and dealing with commuting traffic pale in comparison to just being there and having all the culture and excitement right outside your door.   "

8803,3392887,"11,June,2004",2004-06-11,"    My dad is a physics teacher in what used to be one of the best high school science programs in the state. He has gone to work there every day for the past twenty years and for him it wasn't a ""job"". He got to go to school everyday and work with kids on expanding their physics horizons. Along with the rest of the science faculty they have written grants to get free computers for the classrooms, written the text for the courses they teach because they know what is necessary to get the kids to learn, involved both kids and their parents with outside of school activities like an astronomy night, a giant maze that they built in the wall of the building. He gets into the building usually about 6am or so and doesn't leave until 5 or 6 pm. I write about my dad because he is the faculty member that I know the best....However, the rest of the faculty follows this same behavior.  Due to a new administration this science department has been beaten into the ground and dismantled...In literally less than a years time. One of the faculty members has been transferred to another school in the district without given reason. Not just any teacher, one of the best physics teachers in the department (after my dad of course). This teacher has done so so much for the kids in the school, and so I don't understand why the school would want to get rid of him because of what looks to be someone's personal agenda. Along with this teacher being transferred the faculty has proposed to add another course to the curriculum due to a change in requirements. They offered to develop it, write the needed texts and make what they know will work best for the kids that would be needing this course. The administration said no. Even though 100% of the teachers that would be teaching this course think that it is the best thing for the students. I guess the students get the shaft again. Good job administrators.  I recently attended a board meeting for the school and the other two schools in the district and was shocked to see what actually happens at a school board meeting. After about forty five minutes of students and teachers giving speeches about the teacher that is being moved, many of the speeches very moving and highlighting the behavior of the administration, the meeting just went on to Action Item #2. I was so appalled because I felt that the comments of the students and teachers deserved something more than moving onto the next item of the agenda. The meeting then went on to discuss apparently more important topics involving education, like the price of parking for thirty minutes and the type of food that will be offered at the schools for another twenty minutes.   At NO time did this board discuss education. So I ask, what's the point.   This recent development in the science department is the most childish thing I have ever seen. It's like being in grade school and having to separate the kids that don't get along, or putting a kid in the hallway. The administration will say, well you don't really understand what's happening. So explain it. Tell the department why things are happening, and don't give them some bullshit reason, these are not stupid people. Tell them why you don't want to them to develop a new course, why you think that this would be a bad idea...Instead of just saying, ""no.""  So to the administration of school: GET OVER IT. Stop being vindictive and let the teachers do what they do best : TEACH. The like to do it, they like to help the kids learn, they enjoy it. But like my dad has said, they don't have to. They could come in everyday from 8am - 3pm, stand at the board and lecture to kids out of a textbook, which is the direction that this department is heading. As leaders of educators, do you want to lose the education part? If so, you are doing a great job and keep up your behavior. If not, Back off.   "
20931,3393040,"23,May,2004",2004-05-23,"   My girlfriend and I watched capturing the friedmans last night.  It was a disturbing experience.  For those of you who don't know the plot- it's a documentary about a father and son who were accused of extreme sexual molestation in the mid '80s.  The documentary presents both sides, but definately makes a good case for the innocense of the father and son.  The father committed suicide in jail, but the son's now 34 and is challenging his conviction.  It's amazing how little things change- we're still capable of perpetrating salem witch trial-esque violence in this day and age.  Sad.  Anyway, Jesse Friedman (the son) has a webpage  urlLink here  "
20932,3393040,"20,May,2004",2004-05-20,"   Wired.com ran an  urlLink article  on anti-porn website, xxxchurch.com.   The guys that run xxxchurch.com are a bit inflammatory, but I really like what they're doing.    In other news, my other neighor (there are four of us on the hall) left floaters (note the plural) in the toilet again. If purgatory existed, he'd be adding years upon years to his stay.  Classes are over here at Nashotah.  I spent the past six or so days reading all the stuff I was supposed to read for historical theology and systematic theology during the semester.  So all the material's still decompressing.  I really enjoyed reading Luther and Hooker (which surprised me).     Gas prices are high out here, although I understand they're not as high as some places.  Lee's got a really  urlLink funny pic  on his page about them.  "
20933,3393040,"19,May,2004",2004-05-19,"   Added several links today.  Nashotah's obvious.  Disinformation's one of my favorite websites, and toolband.com... Tool used to be one of my favorite bands.  I'm not so keen on them now, but I'll still include a link.  "
20934,3393040,"19,May,2004",2004-05-19,"   Hey all,  Not sure of what I'm doing at this point.  Will add more later.  Okay, it's later.  Check out  urlLink this  site.  It's where I get the blog name.  Only at Nashotah would I be called a liberal.  Still more information.  Check out my  urlLink neighbor's  blog.  Okay.  Managed to add a ""links"" section.  Can't figure out how to change the font for the ""links"" title, though.  Would appreciate some help.  I read the section in the blogspot help, but I couldn't figure it out from that.  The template I'm using doesn't resemble the example they give.  Not to mention, I had to add the code for the links section, so how and where do I add the code to regulate the font for the ""links"" title?  Frustrating.  "
20935,3393040,"02,June,2004",2004-06-02,   Trying to get everything coordinated before you go out of state can be difficult.    Nashotah's campus is pretty much empty.  Most people have left for the summer.  It feels weird to be here when no one else is.  No links for today.  No new news.

1574,3396638,"05,June,2004",2004-06-05,"    *  UPDATED  *   WITH RESPONSES RECEIVED FROM ION ON JUNE 22, 2004!!  THIS LADY IS TRULY A GEM THAT APPRECIATES HER FANS.  SIX HANDWRITTEN PAGES OF RESPONSES TO  YOUR  QUESTIONS!   Finally compiled and sent out the list of questions for Ion.  Hopefully she'll have the time to answer them while she's FILMING EPISODES FOR SEASON TWO OF THE L WORD!  ;-P  Actually we dont know that this is the case but we're hopeful.  Thanks to the ""Candygirls"" for helping to come up with an outstanding set of questions, and a SPECIAL thanks to PRicanesq, Sistah4U, Mo and Storm for their valued input during the selection/editing process.        Ion Overman Questionnaire    1.	Are you currently working on any TV project or films other than â€œThe L-Wordâ€ [â€œTLWâ€]?  Not at the moment   2.	If you were not an actor, what would you be doing?  I probably would have moved to New York and gotten a job with a fashion magazine.  Something that would allow me to shop, travel and play with make-up.   3.	Since your college major was English Literature, who is your favorite author and/or favorite book?  I have so many favorites, I canâ€™t pick one.  However, one of my favorite books in high school was The Stranger by Albert Camus.   4.	You have become an instant success and a role model for all women, particularly women of color.  What advice would you give to those women of color who would like to break into the industry?  Assuming the person has talent, the most important thing is hunger.  You have to want it so badly, you canâ€™t breathe.  All the stories youâ€™ve heard about the emotional and financial stress and rejection are true.  But if you put your mind over matter and commit 150%, you have a shot.   5.	What was it about acting that made you decide to pursue it as a career, and what is the most rewarding experience you have had as an actor?  Iâ€™ve always been a loner and a bit of an introvert.  I love acting because itâ€™s a way to be an extrovert for a short period of time, without really revealing anything about myself.  Also if I can successfully pretend to be another person, it validates what I like to believe is my understanding of human behavior.  The most rewarding experience as an actor is always having someone tell you that something you did on screen has affected him or her.  I love acting so much, I have a blast whenever Iâ€™m working.  And when someone is moved by something Iâ€™ve done, itâ€™s a responsibility on one hand, but for me itâ€™s the biggest thrill.    6.	Do you have a daily\weekly exercise regimen? If so, what does it consist of?  I actually hate working out.  I do it because I have to, but I should be more consistent.  However, right now I do about 45 min of jog\walking in my neighborhood, followed by about 30min of lunges, squats, sit-ups etc.  When Iâ€™m feeling really crazy, Iâ€™ll do pilates.  I do all of this in various combinations about 4 or 5 times a week.   7.	Your skin and hair are absolutely beautiful.  What is you beauty regimen? What are your favorite beauty products?  A gentle fragrance-free cleanser.  Prescription Differin cream at night.  In the morning I use an antioxidant by Epicuran called Alpha Lipoic Omega Complex, and of course sunscreen.  On my hair I use modern organic products (M.O.P.).  First I spray on their styling tonic (on wet hair), then big blobs of their leave-in conditioner and light hold gel.  Then dry with a diffuser.   8.	Other than collecting antique furniture, what other hobbies do you have?  I love to watch movies.  I go to the movies pretty much every week, and Turner Classic Movies is my favorite channel.  Also I love to shop, read fiction, hang out with friends and cook.   9.	What is your favorite film and why?  As with books, there are so many I canâ€™t pick one.  But some of them are:  - The Man Who Came To Dinner - Sunset Blvd - All About Eve - Dark Victory - A Place in the Sun - A Streetcar Named Desire - Grease - Last Tango in Paris - Breakfast at Tiffanyâ€™s - Like Water for Chocolate - Godfather 1 & 2 - Pulp Fiction - Kalifornia - The Age of Innocence and tons more.  There are lots of reasons why a film becomes one of my favorites, but usually itâ€™s the performances.  I love watching other actors.   10.	What is your ethnic background? What is your family like?  My mother is Black with a little American Indian (Sioux and Cherokee), and my father is a blond haired, blue-eyed Englishman.  Iâ€™m an only child, and my parents and I are close.   11.	Are you single, engaged or married?  Not married, but my boyfriend and I have been together for 4 years.   12.	What kind of animals do you have, if any? What are their names?  I have a fish named Sushi (trust me, he doesnâ€™t mind), and I have shared custody of my parentsâ€™ Golden Retriever.  Heâ€™s 8 yrs old and his name is Bogie.   13.	What types of music do you like? Who are your favorite performers?  I love classical and Jazz (esp. Miles Davis, John Coltrane, Ella, Louis and Billie).  I also love Frank Sinatra.  I also love contemporary R&B and Hip-Hop like Jill Scott, Alicia Keys, Lauren Hill, Snoop, Ja Rule.  I also love Motown and the Beatles.  Again, too much to name.   14.	What year were you born?  Now, now, I do declare Miss  {webmistress' last name} .  You know it is impolite to ask a lady her age.   15.	Regarding your character in â€œThe L-Wordâ€, how are you like Candace and how do you differ?  Moreover, what do you feel is the most important aspect of her presence on the show?  Well our differences are superficial ones, such as occupation and sexual orientation.  But I think we are similar in determination and belief in ourselves.  Also in being true to ourselves.  I think Candace showed us that even strong women are human and can be ruled by their emotions.  That combination of strength and vulnerability is part of what makes us complex and interesting.   16.	How does it feel to know that after playing the role of Candace, so many women are attracted to you?  How does it feel to be a â€œlesbian sex symbolâ€?  I had no idea I was a â€œlesbian sex symbolâ€ until I read the question.  But I am incredibly flattered.  Thank you.   17.	As Candace, your ex-girlfriend (Yolanda), your carpenter crew and the young lady introduced as Mikela were all women of color.  Did you have any say in this or to your knowledge, was this done intentionally/unintentionally by the producers?  I had absolutely no say in it, and I donâ€™t know what the producers meant by it â€“ if anything.   18.	â€œNew York Post: The L Word - Gay â€˜Sex and the Cityâ€ By DANIEL RENZI Beals was so upset by Betteâ€™s unfaithfulness towards Tina, she took out her frustration on the actress playing the part of the other woman. ""That was incredibly distressing,"" (Beals) said gravely. ""I couldnâ€™t be with her on the set for a couple of days. I couldnâ€™t talk to her. I would just look at her like, â€˜Youâ€™re breaking us up!â€™""  Did Jennifer Beals really act this way or was she just kidding?  What is your reaction to her comments?  If you will, please tell us about your experience working with Jennifer Beals [â€œJBâ€]?  Until this Questionnaire I wasnâ€™t aware of the article.  I donâ€™t know if she was kidding or not.  But if she really did feel that way, I didnâ€™t know it.  She was professional and we got our work done.   19.	The chemistry and sex scenes between you and JB were phenomenal!  Are the creators of the show aware of this?  Further, how did you feel about performing those scenes?   While we were shooting, the Powers that Be told us that it was working, and that they were pleased.  I was grateful for the challenge of performing the scenes.  I had never had a sex scene with a woman before, so as an actor I was determined to make people believe me.   20.	Of your fellow actors on The L Word, with whom did you spend more time with outside of the set?  I didnâ€™t hang out with anyone off the set.  I did a lot of sightseeing, shopping and reading while I was in Vancouver.   21.	Are you aware of the negative responses towards you as ""the other woman""? If so, how do you feel about that and would it have any effect on your return to TLW?  I wasnâ€™t aware of the negative responses.  But I take it as a compliment.  It means I did my job.   No, that would have no effect on my return to the show.   22.	Since it seems a lot of people feel you really nailed the body language of a more tomboyish or butch lesbian, can you tell us if there is anything or anyone that you drew specific inspiration from, in your portrayal of Candaceâ€™s presence and mannerisms?  The first thing I did was think like a man.  And one day on the set, I asked one of the male crew members to walk back and forth for me so I could study his gait.  That was helpful.  It helped me get a grip on my center of gravity.   23.	To your knowledge, will Candace return next season and for how many episodes?  If so, can you share the direction in which the show plans to take the Candace character and/or in what direction would you like to see the character go?  I donâ€™t know if Candace is coming back.  I havenâ€™t been contacted.  I donâ€™t know what Candaceâ€™s place could be since she has caused so much turmoil.  But I suppose anything could happen.   24.	What were your immediate thoughts and comments when you saw the website for the first time and have you shared it with any friends and\or family?  Well, I was and continue to be humbled, thrilled and grateful.  Yes, Iâ€™ve told everyone I know about it.   25.	Anything else you would like to tell us?  Iâ€™d like to thank everyone again for visiting the site.  Iâ€™m so glad you enjoy the show, and I hope these answers are satisfactory.       Thank you for your time and cooperation!   "
20826,3403416,"24,May,2004",2004-05-24,"   Look,  The next time I hear some talking head saying Nader is going to cost Kerry the election, I am going to puke on my fucking shoes.   The analogies to the 2000 election with Al Gore are tiresome and incorrect.  Ralph Nader did not cost Al Gore the election, Al Gore cost Al Gore the election.  If he only won his home state or Bill Clinton's state, Florida would not have mattered.  Al Gore looked like an idiot in the debates-rolling his eyes, sighing out loud, shruging his sholders, ect.  Al Gore ran away from Clinton's record.  Considering Clinton was popular despite everything that happened, the Al Gore ran from it.  Al Gore abandoned issues that Democrats care about: jobs, education, health care, and the enviornmet.  Al Gore was the one on stage with George Bush bragging how his ""plan"" would spend more money on the military.  Al Gore and his running mate were the ones who ran around the country with their religous talk, as if GWB didn't talk about it enough.  Face it, the Dems are abandoning their base of support.  They will loose again in 2004 to the most incompetent president in United States history.  Why?  Let's look at Kerry.  It is the same game. The ""nomination"" process only chose Kerry because they felt safe.  Kerry doesn't represent the Democratic party.  Even if he does, he will not fight for the presidency.  He talks about Democratic values, but does not fight for them.    The Democrats/Liberals/Progressives need to start fighting back.  Hannity, Limbaugh, Savage, and the rest of the blow hards cannot continue to spew their garbage unanswered.   For the intelligent Libs out there, it is time to answer these guys.  It is time to stand up for what is right.  "
20827,3403416,"23,May,2004",2004-05-23,"   Vice President Dick Cheney was in Houston last week for a fundraiser.  He took the opportunity to take a few swings at Kerry's ""war on terror"" credentials, again trying to scare the American people to vote for Bush.  Why anybody would trust this administration is beyond me.  Starting from the top, let's remember that neither Bush or Cheney served in a significant way(we can talk about the National Guard, and that is serving, but in comparision to others...).  I have no problems that they didn't serve.  The problem I have lies how this campaign notoriously smears those who did.  Remember John McCain in the Carolinas?   They portrayed him as a wacked-out veteran.  All of this aside, lets look at their Credibility.  Iraq is a mess.  Before the war began, Bush and Cheney made speeches implying mushroom clouds, millions of dead Americans, massive WMD buildups, and on and on......They stated they could do this war on the cheap, a small force will suffice, and Iraqi oil will pay for it all. They even led us to believe our troops will be greeted with flowers and such(like the liberation of Paris in WWII).  To date, everything this adminstration has said about Iraq is wrong.  From the justification of the war, the execution of the war, and the result of the war, they have been wrong the whole time.  And today they are trying to scare us in to voting for them.  I won't harp on the war forever, but it leaves me with a burning question.  What will happen when US intelligence identifies a REAL WMD threat in the future?  What if there is an immediate threat that required military intervention?  What credibilty does the US have?  I would trust Kerry over Bush on this war ANY day.  "
20828,3403416,"20,May,2004",2004-05-20,"   Welcome.  This is my first posting ever, so please be patient as I learn the culture and methodology of blogs.  I enjoy writing about anything, especially politics.  I want this blog to be honest and absent of jargon, cliches, and blind devotion to any party.  With this being my first posting, I want to keep it simple.  The issues I want to address are important.  As U.S. citizens, we need to be aware of two things.  First, the vast majority of us ignore our civic responsibilities, the most important being voting.  Very few people participate in civics, and for our democracy to survive, we must be active participants.  Our national and local leaders are elected by a smaller and smaller group of people, while the rest of eligible voters remain silent.  This must change.  It will only change at the individual level(i.e.  you!).  Second, we are CITIZENS, not consumers.  Corporations exist because we, the people, allow them to.  Corporate charters are granted by the people; corporate charters are not a right.  Elected officials are in office because we put them there.  We have far more power(and responsibility) than we exercise.  This, for the sake of our country, must change.  "
13999,3413492,"27,May,2004",2004-05-27,"    Joyous is the day that you find out that one of your recently completed projects at work has caused a problem... and that the factory is full of this new 'problem'.  I think that I am lucky in that this is not causing a real yield hit, just causing some end of line testing to shift.  Still, I had to break out the mad skills to change my crap back to the 'old way' and now start up some old work that was un-necessary b/c of my previous 'triumph'.  I still got it, I won't need it in a few months when I leave, but I still got it.  On another front  urlLink TheMickster  has joined the ranks.  Props to her.    I can't watch the NBA playoffs for any duration.  The thuggery on defense and the travelling on offense is a horror for any purist to watch.   "
14000,3413492,"25,May,2004",2004-05-25,"    When I go back to school, my wife and I will be living apart.  This will be difficult at times, but it is for the better good of our future.  What will be difficult is that we have to divide all of ""our stuff"" up between us.  This basically comes down to who gets the Tivo unit.  She will be getting it most likely b/c I won't have DirecTV in my graduate dorm (we have a DirecTV Tivo unit - very nice).  Now I must either buy another or go without.  Anyone who has Tivo would understand that going without is pretty damn hard.  So I will be buying another.  Looking around on the web, I should be able to upgrade whatever I buy with a second or a bigger hard drive.  you of course void the warranty, but cheap Tivo with lots of space = good.  Anyone else with experience hacking Tivo?    This also lead to me thinking about hacking DirecTV, but a quick google search turned up info that it is time consuming, capital intensive, and hacking DirecTV carries more fines than hacking Tivo I'm sure.    Bottom line, Tivo rocks.  If you ain't got it, get it!   "
14001,3413492,"24,May,2004",2004-05-24,"    Since I am leaving my job in the next few weeks to return to school, I am ramping down at work.  My replacement is here and I am bringing him up to speed on big picture issues.  Those of you that have ever left a job or hung onto a job when you knew that you were leaving can probably relate easily.  I wonder if everyone goes through periods of low motivation or am I just a big ass slacker?  There are times when it pains me to read email or deal with day to day issues and other times when I just crank through it all.  It seems a lot like 'senioritis' but you would think that people mature and push through all of that crap.  Am I slacker or does this happen with everybody?  I have no desire to tell my boss off or anything extreme like that.  My group has been good to me and I will leave on good terms.    Everyone thinks that they work hard and are truly a worthwhile addition to their workplace.  Have you ever asked yourself how easy are you to replace?  All my company needs is another intelligent body and two months of training from me.  The last part could be picked up in three months of work by the new employee with some help from his/her new peers.  I am quite easy to replace as I am sure is the case with 95% of workers.   "
14002,3413492,"21,May,2004",2004-05-21,"    urlLink The Phantom of the Opera  is coming to Indianapolis Nov 10 through Dec 5!  Tickets go on sale June 14th!  Excellent.  I saw Phantom for the first time in Feb 2004 during the Austin, TX stop and it was fantastic.  I've been on a big Phantom kick recently and this show stop will work out great.  Hope to see it during Thanksgiving weekend.  Once again I will get to enjoy the music of the night...   "
14003,3413492,"21,May,2004",2004-05-21,"    What an unproductive weekend.  While I did do some good by volunteering some time on Friday and Sunday with  urlLink The CenTex Starzz girls high school AAU team .  I keep wondering if I was this stubborn when I was in HS.  It feels like the coaches have to continuously push to get the girls to play hard all the time.  Several of them are really good.  Maybe not Div I, but several could get scholarships somewhere.  It is a blast to coach and hang out with some people who know what basketball is all about and more importantly, how to teach it.    I did take a few breaks to catch some flicks this weekend though.  First up to bat was ""The Karate Kid"".  I paid money to watch this crappy 80's movie so that I could also hear the fine gentlemen of  urlLink Mr Sinus Theater  tear the movie a new one.  The Mr Sinus folk are much like Mystery Science Theater 3000 except they focus on modern bad movies and they do it all live in the theater as you watch.  Bonus points for them because the theater in which they perform is the  urlLink Alamo Drafthouse .  A theater where you can order dinner and DRINK BEER.  I have seen Mr Sinus rip up Terminator, Top Gun (hilarious) and KK.  Up next is Dirty Dancing.  I'm counting the days...  I also saw Shrek 2 this weekend.  It was pretty good, but not as amusing as the original in my mind.  LOTS of good one liners and visual gags.  You have to pay attention or you will miss it.  I wonder how many Starbucks cafes were in the movie...  It's worth it and I got my laughs worth.  On the future front, I am anxiously awaiting my return to the Midwest where I will start business school at Northwestern's Kellogg School of Management in September.  It will be a great change of pace and more importantly it will move my wife and I back to the Midwest where all of our families live.  No more flying for Thanksgiving and Christmas.  Can I get an amen?  The only big task left to complete in Austin is to sell our home.  Keeping the axe to the grindstone is difficult.  I have at most 10 weeks of work left.  Not that I am counting...   "
14004,3413492,"21,May,2004",2004-05-21,"    Uhh, a friend's  urlLink blog  had this posted and I had to try it out.  If the shoe fits...    urlLink    Quiz by  urlLink buntz   "

14006,3413492,"22,June,2004",2004-06-22,"    These last few weeks before our move have been hectic.  The relocation company was a ""pleasure"" to work with.  It could have gone much faster if people were face to face, but we got to play phone tag for two weeks.  I am now in the process of disconnecting current utilities and setting up new ones.  DirecTV seems to be the biggest challenge (so far).  Disconnecting will be easy, but we will have to go through a slightly different route to hook up new service.  Normally, DirecTV will just coordinate the setup of your dish at your new address.  But, because our new home is in a NRTC area (anti-monopoly type creation) we will need to work with the local service provider.  It doesn't look too bad from this end, but it could be deceiving.      On top of all of this utility moving is the address changing portion as well.  Cell phones, credit cards, student loans, car payments...  Ugh.  A web page should be created that is called www.immovingandhereismynewaddress.com.      Thank goodness that we don't' have to pack, load and drive our crap ourselves.  My lovely wife's company will pay for all of that :)    I did see Dodgeball this weekend.  It is pretty funny, but not as funny as Zoolander.  See it during the matinee if possible or just wait for rental.  Not a Saturday night flick.   "
14007,3413492,"04,June,2004",2004-06-04,"    Wife has been out of town since Wednesday but of course these would be the busiest two days I have had at work for a while.  I got to enjoy the rest of my 'bachelorhood' by giving cats antibiotics, running silly errands and finally relaxing by watching an edited replay of the 1993 Indiana @ Penn St Men's basketball game.  IU had waxed Penn St (who was 'enjoying' their first year in the Big 10) at IU by ~50.  Penn St played tough and pushed the then #1 Hoosiers to 2OT.  In the end, the bad team found a way to lose by not scoring when they could push the lead to 2-3 possesions (even though IU's two big men - Alan Henderson and Matt Nover had fouled out and Big John Ameci (sp) ruling the paint) and not playing zone defense worth a crap.  The game will always be remembered for a controversial call. A Penn St player was streaking towards the hoop (with pass on the way) Chris Reynolds of IU grabbed his jersey and the player retaliated with an push off elbow.  The official called the push off foul, but did not call / see the jersey grab.  The Penn St coach went ballistic and IU (down by two) tied the game to go to OT when Greg Graham was fouled while shooting a 3.  He made 2/3 and in the end the bad team won...   "
14008,3413492,"02,June,2004",2004-06-02,"    My wife and I headed into Memorial Weekend with good news in that we received an offer on our home.  We made a counter and they accepted.  This is great news and timing as we were starting to get worried about getting rid of the home so we could move worry free.  With that taken care of, we only need to square away the details with the moving company and figure out how we can entertain our two cats for the long drive North.    This weekend is setup nicely.   urlLink Robert Randoph & The Family Band   at  urlLink Stubb's  tonight and an engagement party for some friends tomorrow.    I should be able to fend off the wife from seeing the latest Harry Potter movie, but she might have to see it late Sunday night like we saw Shrek (read - no kids...)   "
2028,3415194,"26,May,2004",2004-05-26,"   Sleep.  Soft, wonderful, dream-filled, night-passenging sleep.  How elusive.  How estranged from this mortal being.  There are nights when even pills don't help.  "
2029,3415194,"23,May,2004",2004-05-23,"   If it isn't one thing it's another.  First I start having trouble with my lower back and now my right shoulder is giving me pains.  My diet isn't working, the cholesterol medication the doctor gave me has painful side-effects, it's allergy season and my landlady is being a bitch this weekend.  I can't get a minutes peace even when I leave the house.  "
2030,3415194,"21,May,2004",2004-05-21,"   Well, here it is another Friday and I feel like this was another useless week.  It doesn't matter how hard we work in this office it is like there is never any progress.  Kids still get hurt and parents still lie.  Other states ask for help, we ask for help, everyone asks for help.  And the help never comes.  So you pick up another doughnut or soda or candy bar or . . .   And such shining examples of denial.  We have a father that come in to visit with his two year old daughter and screams for dear life during the entire time and he tells the Judge that the visits are going fine.  Kind of hard to keep that ""professional attitude"" going when even the psychologist is laughing at the guy.  "
2031,3415194,"10,June,2004",2004-06-10,   A sense of humor is very important in this job.    They want me to do more work.  BUT they aren't paying me more.  AND I am supposed to be happy that I have a job.  My benefits are decreasing.  But my needs are increasing as I get older.    Next the insurance premium will increase.  But I won't get a cost of living increase.  That's always good for a laugh.  
2032,3415194,"08,June,2004",2004-06-08,   Well?  Why not?  I don't feel good.  And I will probably feel worse tomorrow.  Can't this just go away and stop?  
2033,3415194,"03,June,2004",2004-06-03,"   I know, reliving childhood nightmares is supposed to be an OPPORTUNITY.  I know, I should be addressing the ""inner demons"" in order to make a full recovery.  I know, Susan can't read my mind and cannot possibly know what kind of nightmare I was living through.  But gee, does this kind of event have to be so brutally EFFECTIVE?  Oh wait, you mean if  I  wasn't in such deep denial then this wouldn't have been quite so bad?  You mean if  I  were taking care of my problems this might not have even happened?  Damnit!  Why does everything always have to be my fault?  "
2034,3415194,"02,June,2004",2004-06-02,"   1) I am not perfect. 2) I am not well physically. 3) Money issues are forcing me off of my Prozac. 4) The leasing company is fucking with me. 5) Showering in the morning is becoming an ""issue."" 6) I am regressing again. 7) Where is Danni anyway?   8) Last night Susan called it her computer. Of all the horrible images that raised in my mind.  My childhood came rushing back at me and I saw my parents taking away my best-loved toys because someone else wanted them.  I was so devastated.  If you haven't experienced the horror of being an unwanted child just try and get a clue.  They always took away the things I liked and used.  They would say ""You're the child we never wanted.""  To this day it still hurts.  "
2035,3415194,"02,June,2004",2004-06-02,"   Here it is June already and I am just now finding Christmas ideas.  I am usually more organized than this.  But then this has been a very chaotic year.  Overwhelming debt,  moving, theft and puppies and God only knows what else is yet to come.  Does this mean giving up the Internet?  I don't know but I can no longer afford to pay for it.  So I borrow access from others.  "
2036,3415194,"13,July,2004",2004-07-13,"   I see myself in a house and I am surrounded by friends.  The house has a brown tile floor with plush area rugs.  I am walking toward the sliding glass door to go outside.  There is a small pool and a large grass area.  Perfect for playing.  There are trees and a small garden in the yard.  It is never too hot or too cold and the rain never lasts too long nor gets us too wet.  My friends are the pets that I have known over the years.  Omar, Twinkle, Bear, Buddy, Princess, Samantha, Jasper, Muffy, Sampson, Tinkerbell, Bruiser, Romeo, Honey Bear, Chase, Critter, Mattie, Augie, Barney, Wit and Charm.  We are walking out to the backyard so that we can play.  Bear gives me a kiss and I thank him.    This is a happy visual that I can use to combat depression.  "
2037,3415194,"12,July,2004",2004-07-12,"   A month goes by and suddenly everything is different.  Well, . . . maybe not so suddenly.  I have been reading Dr. Ornish's book about reversing heart disease and had a comeuppance or two.  Or three.    I am forced to admit that I am the unwanted child.  From infancy I have had to force myself on others to be accepted.  Other people never like me they just tolerate me.  The only reason I am tolerated is because I am useful in some way.  It is necessary that I admit this is my problem and that I need to accept this reality and learn to live with it.  I am forced to admit that there is an invisible wall surrounding my heart that will not open.  It is protecting my heart from me.  Nothing has changed.  "

22037,3418474,"31,May,2004",2004-05-31,    Man I haven't written one of these forever.  This past weekend was pretty cool.  Youth was awesome I loved the worship and the small groups were cool.  Saturday I went and helped the food bank that was rad.  Umm sunday I went to church and then set up a trampoline and then I played softball later that night.  My Life with God is pretty good:)...It's kinda tough not having many people to talk to.  I wanna be the light Jesus has called me to be but it is tough.  God's been keeeping me real busy lately sorta to get my mind off the friend situation.  Right now...SOnja is kinda my only good friend and it sorta sucks but at least she's a rad girl:).  I'm trying to live this thing for God and just be the light in the darkness and just try and live for God with my all.  I find it way easier to hang out with people who actually give a crap bout what's goin on in my life.  I love it when people just take time to talk with me and stuff.  I find myself being really fake when I'm with people that already have a bunch of friends and I mean nothing to them.  I love it when I act like the Real Jordan It feels great:).    I'm not quite sure of God's purpose or his plan...But everyday I wanna live Christ:).  It's totally worth it to surrender your all to God cuz he'll only do great works in u.  I haveta stop being of the World...and just be fully like Christ.  My life has a pretty bright future in that It's gonna involve Jesus and God's Plan soo it has to be bright.  I haven't changed soo dramtically yet that people wouldn't know it's me...but that's what I'm planning on doing.  Changing into a true christ follower instead of one of those kids who have things good in their Lives but they never effect the rest of the world.  ANd just let Jesus take hold of everything.  It takes alot of Faith and I am afraid...I shouldn't be but I am...I wanna become fully real and act the same around everyone.  I'm hoping that over the summer and stuff I can really get some friendship booming and just also become really close with God and become real.  People usually fall away from God in the summer I wanna do the opposite and just stick to God like glue.  ANyways guys...If u need prayer just write it in a comment or email me:) That'd be great...It also be Rad if u guys all pray for me and that My walk with CHrist would turn into a sprint:P ANyways cya all later bubye and GOD BLESS AMERICA:) haha not GOD BLESS U:P   
22038,3418474,"24,May,2004",2004-05-24,    These past few days I've been pretty busy...Me n Josh built a soccer net yesterday after church...It's pretty sweet:D.  Today I went boating with my family and that was really fun.  My dad basically let me drive the whole time it was awesome.  My life is seeming more and more purposeful.  I just love being in God's presence and worshipping him it's amazing.  I'm hoping that everyday I live my life a lil more true to who I'm supposed to be.  I'm sick of being fake...and sick of putting up fronts:S.  I'm aiming to be totally real and just being who God wants me to...Instead of being soo stupid and being who I made up myself to be.  Right now My life is pretty distraction free soo it's pretty awesome.  I don't have any friends tieing me down...or any girls I'm likeing or any girlfriends:P.  It makes God way more accessible and makes it way easier to find time to get close to him.  I've spent soo long just at the same place:S...Like where I wanted God with all of me but there was soo much holding me back.  I was afraid of stuff and now I've given it to God.  Life's looking brighter everyday.  Idn what my future is but I know God's plans r gonna be played out. anyways:P...If u care to comment do it..otherwise w/e haha God bless ya guys cya later   
22039,3418474,"22,May,2004",2004-05-22,"    Another day another dollar...I've done nothing today:P cept some chores and I also watched Peter Pan the movie:D haha it's actually pretty good it kinda exactly copied the disney cartoon version tho.  My life right now is good for the most part.  I'm trying with all of me to focus on God with everything I do.  I've made soo many mistakes in these past few weeks and it's been a real bummer cuz I've lost alot of people and also...grades:P.  I'm slowing finding the real me.  The real me is who God's created me to be not who I was trying to be.  Haha these past few weeks I've been also really fake just cuz I didn't know how to handle the pressure:s...and there again I lost alot because of it and gained a whole bunch of things I don't need.  I want to be exactly what God created me to be.  I know this is a bold statement, but I wanna just do w/e God asks and give my life to him...I was afraid to do this for soo long thinking maybe he wouldn't get me the girl I want, maybe he wouldn't get me the friends I need, maybe I'd just end up as some pastor somewhere and just not having fun and just not having very much money:P these have all been doubts of mine, but now...Me and Jesus hand and hand are gonna walks this....and if I fall he'll pick me up...If i'm tired he'll carry me...if I'm down he'll lift me up...If life feels hopeless he'll give me hope:).  God Rules!!!  regardless your situation just embrace God...Life can't get any better than when u do.  Another thing...Don't fall into Spiritual Pride. Idn who this is for...but God put this on my heart to just write this:P...haha Idn who reads these prolly not many but just don't think ur strong enough to do things that u have a weakness towards like say go to a party where there's alcohol...or do stuff with friends that aren't on fire for God...Or maybe even just u got a weakness with the opposite sex:s but just don't think ur strong enough cuz ur not.  God can be ur strength and get u through anything...but if u open up a door to your weakness then Satan can take control of your life....and once he does this you'll fall flat on your face. Alright well...Idn if u want things to be prayed for just tell me anyone who cares and reads this:)...I wanna pray for anyone who wants me to. Anyways God Bless u guys:) take care   "
22040,3418474,"21,May,2004",2004-05-21,"    haha I decided to go with the fad:P(y) and make myself a blog.  Haha life for me this past while has been really rough.  Idn...I guess I just lost my footing a bit and God became less of a thing and my friends, school, and parents relationships became more priorities because everyone of those things was screwed:P.  I've made a committment and I'm giving my all to God.  I want Jesus to be my bestfriend...and man I'm sick of lukewarm living.  I've been really talking to God lately...and man I've just given like all these problems I have to him...and like nothing has really been solved...but I've got a peace about it.  My relationship with my parents has been kinda junky this past while...I've been constantly having to humble my self and apologize, but I'm finding God gives me an obedience that I can't help but do what they ask.  The Friends Sitch is pretty trashed:P...I kinda blew it a bunch with a bunch of different people.  Man  Idn who God has for me as friends...but I'm hoping God brings someone quick.  And I know u think like o u got tons of friends:P like...I'm looking for close friends...not shallow hang out friends.  Once u've had a best friend u can't go without one if u know what I mean...It's just like someone is there and they care soo much for u and they just wanna talk to u:)...and just know how ur doin.  Jesus and me r gonna get super tight...but if u know what i mean...it's kinda like u need someone who u can see and someone who's physically there:P Idn.  Welp Anyways...I'm really excited bout what life has in store,  I'm doin this thing for God...and I'm gonna do w/e that takes:)...GOD RULES EH???  Blessed be his glorious name!!!:D haha reply if u wish:) haha comments are nice   "
22041,3418474,"22,June,2004",2004-06-22,"    Man summer is here Yea baby!!!!!:)  I decided to leave all these thing up to God again.  I'm feeling great about the friends situation...God will provide all I have to do is trust in him.  TOday I worked down at my dad's job site and that was kinda wearing on me cuz i went to bed at one and I think I woke up at 6 this morning cuz my dad woke me up to get me to work:S and I didn't even know I was gonna work:S. Then I came home and put up lawn furniture and skateboarded:P...haha weird eh I think I might start skateboarding again.  :P Haha that was my day and most people already probably heard an exact replica:P.   It's soo hot out it's amazing:) I wanna get myself a wicked tan.  I'm taking off to Cali tomorrow to ride the waves:P...haha I wish naahh I'm goin to Saskatchewan to ride the tractors hahaha:P bad comparison.  But yea hopefully I have fun down there or over there.  Grrr :@ k well I'm absolutely done with living even the tinyest bit away from my Jesus.  I'm gonna go for it all and get as close as I can.  I've given alot of thought to the things I've said on this blog and I've decided that I should fulfill em.  I know the right way and since i do I'll be judged accordingly by God on the day when I die.  I want to have a wicked crown when I get to heaven haha maybe not wicked cuz wicked is from hell:P just awesome and yea man I wanna get myself treasures in heaven.  I wanna live this thing for God:).  Man I'd kill to here the words "" well done my good and faithful servant"":) that'd be soo soo amazing.  This has been long soo far but keep reading:P...  God has my life in his hands now...I'm given myself to him. I wanna live by the spirit and bye what he wants.  God kicks Satan butt. The chorus of one thing by Finger 11 is killer to describe what I feel:  If I traded it all If I gave it all away for one thing Just for one thing If I sorted it out If I knew all about this one thing Wouldnâ€™t that be something  Like Man i wanna trade it all away for one thing...It's tough tho  I'm sick of my living tho soo it's my only option and I know it's the right one cuz I feel the holy spirit telling me to give myself away to God and trust him.  Alright guys that's a lil peek into my life I know it's long but comments are great:) I hate joke comments:P...Unless u can really make me smirk then I'm fine:)  GOD BLESS YOU ALL and to all a goodnight:P  Oh yea...guys if ur up for the bible study tell me...I wanna arrange a couple meetings this summer for it(y) Adios   "
22042,3418474,"19,June,2004",2004-06-19,"    Today was pretty rad:D it was the last day of school and I finally finished exams and yea I hung out at Lorne's for awhile with some people then I went to uth. Wow I'm tired:S not just physically, but mentally and spirituallly. School has been a drain on my mind...cuz I had to finish alot of hw.  I'm sick of all the on going battles inside me:S.  Man Jesus called us to be either hot or cold and right now I'm just sitting in one place.  My pastor said there's no such thing as staying in one spot because it's an uphill battle, soo if ur doin nothing ur only goin downhill.  I'm soo spiritually hungry right now...I need to have my tank filled.  Man I want Jesus soo badly right now.  I'm soo lost with the friends situation:S I have no clue what goin on.  I want Jesus like crazy, but it makes it hard when the friends who were all going for God kinda ditch u and then u haveta become friends with all these people who rn't too into the things of God.  I've worried about friends alot this past semester of school.  It's taken alot of my mind off of other things.  Now I'm just putting it into God's hands and waiting.  There's nothing I can do.  W/e I try to make happen I botch it up.  I need the Lord to help me in all things:).  I'm sooo glad it's summer now...finally I can take a moment to breathe:P and just think about what's goin on.  I wanna get my life totally in sink with what God wants.  It's gonna be tough to do.  I just need God to provide me with some awesome friends again like I had b4....:PIn these stupids blogs I've talked bout how I want to live for God and stuff and all and I meant it, but I haven't changed much since and i want a dramatic change to happen.  Something soo dramatic that people will recognize I'm a christian by only looking in my eyes.  I want Jesus written all over me. :S I'm tired of lukewarm living. I'm tired of ups and downs and I'm tired of worrying about my future when God has control.  I need to live christ.  Man:s the battle is insane.  Be praying for me :) I need as much of it as I can get.  I want to learn my life purpose and what God has planned for me and what direction I'm supposed to head.  I'll pray for anyone who sends me a prayer request:D just email it to me.  Whoever did the Bible study or worship thing with me...Do u guys wanna do that again sometime??? that was cool.  Like...Mark, Joel, Steph, SOnja, Nicole, umm Lorne haha whoever reads this and who's up for it we should do something.

Haha I don't know what happend with all my friends:S...It's kinda a bummer letting go of alot of them. But they don't seem to miss me or nothing.  I've been trying to be more real with myself:)...and it turns out that if I'm real with myself I'm not all that great of a person haha  actually crappy is a better term...It's almost like I saw myself like alot without God and I realized like man the real me without God is terrible and I gotta have him fully in my life.  :S I'm talked soo much bout living this totally for God but man it's been tough:S.  I'm doing fine...Like I'm not off the target...I know what's the truth and now I'm heading towards it with more intensity then I have been.  I get caught up alot of the time with Self- rightousness and Spiritual Pride and that's cuz I am striving for God:S...Idn Mr.Kennedy talked about how striving for God isn't what we should be doin it's more like we gotta live by the spirit and like that's how in turn we'll get close to God.  It's not like u keep up living a moral life and u get close to God.  That's what we all buy into.  we all end up trying to ""live for Christ"" yet we just basically limit oursleves to some dumb rules and crap and we don't go anywhere:S.  Man we gotta live this for Christ but the way we do it is living by Faith and living by the Spirit.  God rocks...but don't limit yourself:)...U'll always fall short with Stupid rules.  Just live by the spirit and let the holy spirit decide choices for u.  Thinking bout it that way I think it's rad cuz it's almost like God is making decisions for u:D haha that's awesome.  Haha he could make u something way better than u make yourself.  Give ur all to him.  Don't be afraid:)...that's what Satan wants.  Don't give in to the thought that God doesn't have ur best intentions in mind.  God bless u:)and if could comment that'd be great...And if u comment I'd like it alot if u put your name to it:)   "
22044,3418474,"03,June,2004",2004-06-03,"    Oh man it was awesome outside today:D!!! It was soo sunny and beautiful:).  I got out early today and soo I just basically did homework till lunch time then I went out to mcdonalds and then came back and did more hw:P.  I'm really trying to boost my marks up in this final stretch and do all the assignments I've missed.  I've been pretty busy with that and I've been kinda tired from staying up too late:P.  Life with God is pretty good...I've told about what I want and who I want to be in Christ and now I haveta walk it out.  Reflecting Christ's image is tough cuz man he's perfect...but that's kinda my aim to just have Jesus written all over me:).  I've said this lots like who I wanna be in christ...but I haveta fully take action and just give my all.  Sometimes It's hard to give ur all and I'm really working on it.  Satan just grips us with fear:S and he's makes us pretend to be things we're not and makes us live in insecurity and fear of our future.  Giving your all to God frees us from the fear and being afraid what's goin to happen.  Man...ANother thing that's kinda bumming me out is how fake everyone is:( It's just soo lame.  I just rather people be who they really r and not put on fronts.  I rather people not say they're christians if they don't even want God until like it's uth group or something and they put on a front ""o I'm tight with God"" but really they're not close to God at all.  People all deserve a chance don't get me wrong...but if u rn't even trying there's no point in faking it.  Live life like there's no tomorrow.  Do this thing for Christ:).  Be the real u whoever that might be.  Don't feel pressured into christianity.  If ur not real about it either get real or just be the person who u really are acting like out of church and out of the christian groups.  Be the person u'd be like when u hang out with Non- christians...cuz then that's more where ur heart is and it's less fake.  I want u guys to all go for God.  But be real:)  God bless u all and guys if u ever need prayer I'll pray for anyone just send me prayer requests or something:D take care   "
14009,3419991,"31,May,2004",2004-05-31,"   This has been a busy weekend! On Saturday was Erwin's 75th birthday celebration. First, we had a mass in the afternoon for him. The church choir sang as a surprise, and Johannes and I decided to cantor everything about an hour before mass, so we had to learn everything really fast. I'm discovering that singing during pregnancy is rather difficult because I can't take deep breaths. The baby must be squishing my diaphragm. The mass was nice though. In the evening, we went to his party. There were tons of people there, and even more food. There was a buffet with vegetables and seafood and fruit and lots of other stuff. Johannes and I ate so many appetizers that we barely had room for the main course. After that, there was a dessert buffet. It was so popular that we ran out of small plates and had to use dinner size plates. After I finished my dessert, Johannes was still hungry, and came back with a dinner plate filled with dessert. I was surprised because he had already had 2 plates, just like I had. He ate it all though. Then came the entertainment. There were lots of musical things and a couple skits. Ludger, Brigitte, Johannes and I played something together- viola, guitar, recorder and flute. There was a funny skit at the end that Helga thought of. It was about saving time during ironing. It involved cutting up a shirt that Michael was wearing so that only the parts that show when you have a suit on were still there. Then Johannes, Ludger, and Christoph came up at the end, and they all took their jackets off and they all had these strange looking cut-up shirts on. It was pretty funny. I think I have a picture of Johannes in his.  On Sunday was Pentecost, and the choir sang again, so I had to get up early to go to practise. I was really tired from the night before. It was a nice mass, and I was glad to be up in the choir loft, away from the incense. Afterwards, Johannes and I were both feeling pretty lazy, and we took some leftovers from the buffet from the night before out of the fridge, and put them on the table outside and ate as much as we could. There was a lot of food leftover, and not enough people took leftovers with them, so Johannes and I ended up with a lot. It was a nice day, so Johannes and I enjoyed the sun and then went for a swim at his parents' place.   Today was also a holiday here. It's Pentecost Monday. It's also our anniversary, so it's nice that we are both home to celebrate. We had church this morning, and afterwards went downtown to eat in a Mexican restaurant. The weather isn't that nice today, and Johannes was falling asleep on the bus, so we decided not to walk anywhere, so we came home and slept for a bit. It started pouring during that time, so it's a good thing we have a nice tenant who brought in our laundry from outside. All my pants are out there at the moment, and I don't want to wear a dress to work tomorrow. Later, we ate cheesecake and watched the wedding video and lit our wedding candle. I sang along with everything and did all the church responses too. Johannes was laughing at me. I also had to pause the wedding video because I had forgotten what my wedding shoes looked like, and I had to find them.  So, it's been a good weekend. Coming up this week is our first birth preparationn class, my first water gymnastics class, and the new Harry Potter!! I'm hoping to see it next weekend, but I'm not sure when it will be availabe in English. I might have to wait until June 15 to see it, but if I'm lucky, I'll be able to see it this weekend. That's all for now, I think.   "
14010,3419991,"22,May,2004",2004-05-22,"   Welcome to my first post. When I woke up this morning, I had no idea I would be creating a blog today, but that changed when Hannah came online and talked me into it. So here I am. She has one now too.It's at http://hanniverse.blogspot.com/. While making my profile for this blog, I noticed that my website had been deactivated because I haven't updated it in so long. I think I will work on it today, because my name is wrong and the picture of me isn't very good.  Time for a pregnancy update. Everyone asks me about that, so it must be interesting.I'm 30 weeks pregnant now, which means there are 66 days, or 10 weeks until the baby is born. It sounds like a lot, but I think it will go by fast. I only have 3.5 more weeks of work, and then I can start organizing the mass of baby stuff which is taking over the basement.This morning, I organized the cupboard full of baby stuff in our rooom because it wasn't shutting  properly. Yesterday, I bought 4 cute baby outfits for a really good price. I hope the baby is a girl because they are all girly. On Monday, I have my doctors appointment, and I will be getting an ultrasound, so hopefully I will find out the gender this time. I also have to get a shot because my blood type is negative. Other than that, I have no idea what will happen. Hopefully my iron level has improved.  Let's see...what else is happening? Next week is Pentecost and Erwin's birthday party. Johannes, Ludger, Brigitte, and I are playing some music for that. My flute is broken, so I have to borrow one for next week. I hope it's not too different from mine. Our wedding anniversary is also coming up soon, and it happens to be a holiday here (Pentecost Monday), so Johannes and I are going to go out somewhere to eat, then do something that we haven't decided on yet, and later watch the wedding video. Then it will be June. The first week is exciting because we start our childbirth preparation class, I start water gymnastics for preegnant people, and the new Harry Potter movie comes out on the fourth. I stop working on the 16th, and then Ludger and Brigitte get married on the 26th, and soon after that, it's July. Two very exciting things are happening in July. Well, one for sure. Anne is coming to visit on the 26th. Or the 27th. I have to check. The baby will be born too. She's due on July 28th, but she might decide to come in August, or earlier in July. We'll see.  The cats went to the vet this week. It was the first time they ever met a German vet. She lives on our street, and a few days ago, we found 2 ticks on Sara and couldn't get them off, so Johannes went down the street and rang her doorbell, and she told us where her office was. We went the next day, and the cats got vaccinated and Sara got his ticks removed. They didn't enjoy it much, but they did enjoy the free food sample that the vet gave them. We also bought tick/flea stuff that they get every month, and a tick remover.  Anyway, that's enough for now. I'm hungry and lunch is almost ready.   "
14011,3419991,"13,June,2004",2004-06-13,"   It's been a pretty quiet week this week. My cold still isn't gone, so I've been feeling lazy. The weather was really hot for most of the week too, which only increased my laziness. It got so hot that Johannes dragged the extra bed up from the basement, so we have 2 single beds to sleep on, so that we don't have to sleep in our extremely hot loft. The only problem is the beds are right next to the window, and as soon as it gets light, I wake up and can't get back to sleep. I don't really like waking up before 5. The curtains don't seem to help much.It cooled down on Friday though, so it is possible to sleep in the left until it heats up again. I think it's supposed to be hot tomorrow. The kids at work will like that, because we turn the water pump on for them when it's really hot, and they play with water and sand and make a huge mess. They really enjoy it. I only have three days of work left. Wednesday is my last day. I'm looking forward to sleeping longer in the morning and having time to organize stuff around the house and to actually have time to cook interesting things.  Let's see...what else did I do this week? Wednesday was childbirth prep. We practised sitting on the birthing balls and breathing. I didn't enjoy that much because she kept saying to breathe through my nose, which wasn't possible and I was supposed to sit so far forward on the ball that I could barely keep my balance. We saw some pictures too, and they were black and white, and illustrations and not photos, so Johannes couldn't find anything to complain about. They all had english captions, which was helpful so I had some idea of what the teacher was talking about. There are still a lot of medical words I don't know and Johannes doesn't know how to translate them all. We also did a couple of relaxation exercises, but I kept relaxing too much and falling asleep. I don't think that will work during labour, so I should learn how to relax and stay awake at the same time. Thursday was Corpus Christi, which is a holiday here, so I didn't have to work. It was a very hot day, and we had mass outside, and that was follwed by a procession around Marienborn with lots of singing. I skipped the procession though, because it was very hot and my legs were hurting. Poor Johannes had to wear an altar server robe and carry a heavy speaker. He invited all the altar servers to his parents' house in the afternoon for a swim, since they were away for a day, but it started pouring 10 minutes before everyone was supposed to come, so no one came. There was thunder and lightening, and it was a really cool storm.Johannes and I went swimming by ourselves, and it was fun to listen to the rain pounding on the roof while swimming. The lightening made Johannes a little nervous though. On Saturday, I finished up the baby shopping. My bus pass expires on Thursday, and I won't be getting another one. Since it takes me forever to decide on baby stuff, I decided I should finish it before my bus pass runs out. The only thing left to buy now is cloth diapers, and Johannes and I are planning to get those on Thursday. I haven't done anything interesting today, only a lot of eating and being lazy. Anyway, time for bed now because I have to work early tomorrow.   "
14012,3419991,"06,June,2004",2004-06-06,"   I went to the doctor today, and everything went pretty well. My iron is still a bit low, but at least my thyroid is normal. I had an ultrasound to check how the baby is growing, and she's grown a lot in the last 2 weeks. She's only 1 week too small now, which is pretty good. She weighs about 3.7 pounds. I have 2 new pictures, which I will scan and put on my website soon. Not much else is new. I only have a week of work left.I'm looking forward to having time off so I can get all the baby stuff together. It's really hot today. It's about 32 degrees, or maybe more. I have to be outside a lot at work, and there isn't much shade, so I get really hot. Johannes and I went swimming at his parents' place after work, but the pool was over 30 degrees as well, and it felt like a bathtub. Time to go cook now.   "
14013,3419991,"05,June,2004",2004-06-05,"   The new Harry Potter movie came out this week. After weeks of waiting, it's finally here! It came out in Germany on Thursday. There was actually a showing right at midnight, but that wasn't very practical since I had to work the next morning. I couldn't go Thursday night either, because I had to go to my water gymanstics class. So,we went last night, which was Friday. It was my first time ever in a German movie theater. The one we went to is the newest one in town, and the biggest. It has at least 10 theaters in it, and I think it's bigger than Silvercity in Victoria, but I'm not sure. They sell lots of food there, and there's even a restaurant so you can eat before you see a movie. Right before the movie starts, someone comes in and sells ice cream so you don't have to eat it before the movie starts. The most exciting thing about the theatre itself was the chairs. They are huge and comfortable, and the best thing is they aren't all individual with hard plastic arms. Some are big enough for two people, and the arms are all soft, and the back of the chair goes all the way up to your head. They were really comfy. The screen was really huge too. German popcorn is really weird though. You can buy either sweet, which is sort of like caramel popcorn but not really, or salty. I wanted butter for mine, and no salt, but that didn't work. There was about half an hour of advertisements before the movie actually started, and after they were done, they turned all the lights on again, and the ice cream person came in, and then a few minutes later, the movie actually started. There was a break in the middle of the movie. It was kind of annoying because I wanted to keep watching, but it wasn't too long, and it gave me time to go to the bathroom without missing everything, so it wasn't so bad. Very practical for pregnant people.We saw the movie in English, mainly because we could get better seats there than in the German one. Another neat thing about German theatres is that you can buy the tickets ahead of time, and pick your seats. Also, you can buy a booklet with 5 movie coupons and use them whenever you want and it's cheaper than just buying two tickets whenever you feel like going. I really liked the movie.It went really fast, and they left out a few things I wanted to see, but it was still good. I think the ending especially went too fast, because I think if I hadn't read the books, I would have been a bit confused about some things. I won't say too much more because I don't want to ruin for anyone. After the movie, we had to wait forever for the bus, and met this drunk guy who was complaining to us about a dying pigeon that he found and he wanted to give it to us. Then the bus finally came, and I was watching all the crazy drivers out the window, and this one car turned a corner and cut the bus off, and we nearly ran into it. Mainz at that time of night is a little too exciting for me, I think.  The movie was probably the best part of my week, but I did do a couple of other interesting things. One was getting a bad cold, which is more annoying than exciting. I've been all stuffed up since Wednesday,and my throat's sore too. I stayed home from work on Thursday because my head hurt so much that I didn't want to be around screaming kids. I went back on Friday, but I wasn't feeling all that much better, but I don't have all that many days of work left, so I don't want to miss that much.   On Wednesday, Johannes and I went to our first birth preparation class. It was a bit hard for me, because there were lots of new German words that I didn't know, and we had to do strange exercises and I couldn't figure out what I was supposed to do, but it was interesting. I  think Johannes liked it too, except for when we were doing all the stuff where I had to lean on him. I think I'm a little too heavy for that. We also practiced breathing, which worked pretty well, except that I couldn't breathe through my nose. On Thursday, I went my first water gymnastics class. I really liked it. The swimming pool was super warm, and it feels really good to be in water. I feel so much lighter there. We threw balls around, and had bike races on noodles, and did strange leg exercises.  I had a bit of trouble understanding instructions, but I eventually figured everything out. I sure learned a lot of new German words this week.  I didn't do much at all today. I've been really lazy, hoping to get rid of this cold.Johannes and I also started working on picking some music to play at Ludger's wedding reception. Yesterday afternoon, I explored a music store downtown and found a book of flute duets that would work for Johannes and I. He has a tenor recorder, and I have my flute. It's hard to find duets because flutes usually play high notes, and the tenor recorder doesn't go that high. I finally found a book with duets from the 1800s that works. We picked a couple of them, and then worked on a piano duet, and then Johannes pulled out one of his old organ books, and I played the top part on my flute, and he played the rest on the piano. It was interesting sight reading- tons and tons of sixteenth notes that were really high for me to play. I think it would have worked better if I could breathe through my nose. I don't know how much of that stuff we'll actually play for the wedding, but it was fun to work on.  Anyway, that's enough for now. I should really try to get some sleep.   "
18098,3425069,"29,May,2004",2004-05-29,"   Sorry it's taken so long to get another post up, it's been so busy at work that I haven't had time to post....  We've reached the end of the first week, and Wow, What a Week!  Polls that show the conservatives at 35% in the Polls vs Libs at 40%, Nationally 30 for the Conservatives vs 38 for the Libs. That seems like an upset to me.   In LNC, things are flying along smoothly. We're getting great reactions from people at the door, and we are getting lots of ""I was a life-long Liberal, but I don't like that Martin/Fontana guy"". To me, that smells like a riding that will be shifting to Blue!  Personally, it's incredible to see the change as people are now relying on me as a bigger partner in the campaign team. I guess offering 50 hours a week to the campaign can do that :) I only wish I could bump it up to 100, but I guess it's a good idea to be paid, so I'll keep the job here for now :)  Today was a great canvassing blitz that was extremely positive & helped us to via for a dominant position in the riding. Joe Fontana's boys/girls are running scared & we are on a clear path with a strong strategy. Here's to it's continued success!  "
18099,3425069,"23,May,2004",2004-05-23,"   I'm not sure whether you got a chance to watch Paul Martin walking from 24 Sussex to the Govenor General's residence. If you missed it, good for you. If, like me, you had nothing better to do at 1pm than watch it, I feel great pity for you (and for me?).  The throngs of reporters around him as he walked up with his wife was ridiculous. Why not have one or two cameras, feed it into a pool, and give the man his last dignity. After all, he won't be making a walk like it ever again (a la Winds of Conservative Change).   The idea that this is such a huge media event is just silly. It doesn't even deserve to be labeled with the much hipper word 'ridiculous'. Let's call it what it is, silliness. Do any of the reporters there really expect Paul Martin to drop some type of bombshell announcement as he walks up to have the writ dropped? And if he did drop some tid-bit anyways, wouldn't a single feed for all the networks offer access to the same information?  Ok, so that got more attention, even in this post, then it deserved.  This morning I was out at 7 am putting signs on bridges in the city. There's something about putting up a sign in the pouring rain with lightening starting overhead to make getting involved in a campaign seem fun. If you doubt whether it can really be fun, give it a try (seriously good times)  Tomorrow should bring with it some light door-knocking (after all, it's a holiday & time to relax!)....  "
18100,3425069,"22,May,2004",2004-05-22,"   As pretty much everyone knows, the writ gets dropped tomorrow.  In those immoral words from 9/11 ""Let's Roll!""  (disclaimer: this is not to indicate that the Liberal hold on Canada is in any way related to the grip of terror that the 9/11 terrorists held over the U.S, but instead to applaud the call to action of those brave heroes ~ if you thought this, then really, what is wrong with you ?!?)  More large signs go up tomorrow morning at 7 am for a copy of hours. After a 17 hour day today, that's pretty brutal, but that's life on the campaign trail. Good thing tomorrow is a Sunday, and therefore should mean a bit of a respite.  As the last little bit for today, I just have to say that there are some real sharp people working on the Gatten campaign. It should be quite a ride...  "
13734,3426788,"31,May,2004",2004-05-31,"   I'm having busy days. A bad experience with .net and I was wondering, how am I going to fix my website? Well for newcomers, I already have a complete flash website. Iâ€™ve uploaded it 2 days ago & marketed it. SMS, Mail, Instant Messages, Chat Room advertising everything Iâ€™ve done to tell the world that I was online. It was a good experience. My mood was pregnant. It is like buying a home in downtown New York or Sunset Boulevard. lol even Upstate New York is not a bad idea.    I was dying to see my guest book & No. of visitors. The first one to sign in was my dear bro. Heramb .. Well he is a nice guy. Always funny â€¦ yet somber at times but even that solemnity has a tinge of laughter in it. Whenever I watch Will Smith , I find Heramb so much reminiscent of him .. lol like I did , yesterday, when I was watching MIB II on HBO. He was online that night and provided me with good hints n tips regarding my website. Well he was kinda busy wid damsels â€¦. I know itâ€™s high time for him to get some one â€¦ (hope His parents r not reading this:P)   The one comment I was keenly waiting for was of Ashutosh. Now He is my dear bro. too but exactly opposite of me. A Very Shy Guy , as he loves to call himself , skinny , always wearing the naÃ¯ve specs of intelligence. As expected he sent me a long mail very next day with heapz of tips n tricks. It was a good mail to read. He diagnosed the websiteâ€™s present condition well & presented new ideas. I replied him immediately expressing my joy for an apt reply & thanking him for his program (which hotmail deleted cuz an .exe file as an attachment is considered as a potential threat.)   Before him, I met a good friend of mine. Anu, as I call her wid love, I met her few months down the line in chat rooms n sent her summer of 69 song in Mail :P â€¦ Since then I never chatted wid her in Private Messages. As the juggernaut of time rolled, we met again tht night. Iâ€™venâ€™t seen her in person, but I can sense her Suave nature & Sprightly presence around. I guess u donâ€™t have to meet people to know them, Its something inside that ticks. Or else peepz live together for number of yrs n feel astonished every now n then bout their partners. The best thing : SHE LOVES GAMING LIKE ME. I Dunno, How good she is in CS (Counter Strike) as she proclaims. Let me have a game wid her someday... n let me see who get the most FRAGS.   Back to the 31â€™st may â€¦. I was thinking the whole day bout nature of my website. I had a very crude, rookie design online. My main intention was to put up a website for game programmers, loaded wid tuts n games. Some sections for vb/vc programmers and discussion forums should be handy.   To be frank, I was happy when I designed my flash based website. Later I found it very spiteful. A failed attempt of a Greenhorn as u call or a Neophyte (Thanks to Barronâ€™s :P). Suddenly I found myself visualizing bout the website more and more.   I needed a sleek, super sleek design wid minimum of mess n loadz n loadz of useful links & tutorials.  I will definitely have some flash part in it. Huh thaâ€™s the best way to show ur knowledge bout the damn thing. As a hard ass perfectionist Iâ€™m, I believe certain things in life represent U. 1> Your resume 2> Your matrimonial Ad and 3> Your website. If you have spelling mistakes, disorganized content, perplexed design then it shows negligence on ur part & not the finesse you want to depict.   "
13735,3426788,"23,June,2004",2004-06-23,"   Arete, Sophrosyne, Sumpsimus, Serpiginous, Gaminerie and Autochthonous  Can anyone guess meaning of these words: O â€¦..? Lol... forget about meaning. How about spelling them correctly in Single chance â€¦ in front of a big audience in Grand Hyatt Washington. Hats off to you. If youâ€™ve guessed it. No â€¦ I ainâ€™t talking about GRE and TOEFL and BARRONS or CAPLAN Tests. This is National Spelling Bee 2004. The winner was David Tidmarsh, a 14 yr old Indiana boy. David, an eighth-grader at the public Edison Intermediate Center in South Bend, won the top-prize package of $12,000 and an engraved cup from the bee, plus an additional $5,000, encyclopedias, a $1,000 savings bond and a reference library from other sponsors  Whoa â€¦ Nothing get bigger than this. I was flipping channels ,trying to find out some value based entertainment. Discovery was showing the re runs. National Geographic was a passÃ©. Suddenly I saw this competition on ESPN 2. I couldnâ€™t resist myself. I put aside all the work I was doing (lol How bout David J. Kruglinksiâ€™s Inside VC++). My eyes were glued to idiot box (Very often I find myself in this situation if Baywatch is not playing or Swimsuit illustrated Pageants are not showing).   I was loosing it totally â€¦ Couldnâ€™t spell better than them. At the end when David hide his face behind his placard then I found myself standing and clapping with the same enthusiasm as Davidâ€™s mother.   These contests are amazing. Intel science fair or National Spelling Bee or Any other talent examsâ€¦. It shapes up your mind, character. It strengthens you to face any challenge, overcome any adversity. Talk about prizes, name, and fame â€¦ Itâ€™s a serious Addiction â€¦  Let me tell you Addiction of fame is the dangerous amongst all types of addiction. You start to feel more n more hungry or thirsty for that share of limelight â€¦. The worst situation to be in than any Man Eater Leopard/Tiger.  I know it better than many of my peers. Once you reach to such plateau it is very hard to come down or thinking of descending. Once youâ€™ve been there for years and years then it is very hard to fathom the defeats, it is callous to accept the failures.  But every trough has a crest to follow and vice versa. Thatâ€™s why life is interesting and it is not monotonous.   I wouldnâ€™t ever trade my multidimensional (add dimension of time also) life to any other dull, monotonous, droning lifestyle. I think to feel the zephyrs of success whirling around you & then face the calmness, coldness of failures and carrying the torch of hope to find that warmth shanty of success is the essence of life. Mansions of successful lives are built upon the foundation of failures and sagacity and erudition derived from them.   "
13736,3426788,"06,June,2004",2004-06-06,"   For last 4 days I was frantically waiting for something to happen. Related to my life or at least related to my website. It was true â€“ my first dig at personal website creation was terrible than a neophyteâ€™s practice work. A Bad design in Flash was the culprit.  I wanted to put everything in my website. Programming articles, Game designing tutorials, Several Links & Hundreds of utilities â€¦ My present website wasnâ€™t even accommodating my info. On 5â€™th night, I was searching for good layouts for my website n suddenly Voila! I found one. It was a sleek, sophisticated online curriculum vitae layout by Ubooty (A company based in Norfolk,UK). By the way it was free.  I downloaded it enthusiastically and created my home page with minimal efforts. This time by hopes were centered on Flashâ€™s elder brother Macromedia Dreamweaver. What a Name !!! Dream Weaver. Hats off to them.  As I was going strong & creating my web pages at a speed of nauts, I confronted a IceBerg straight ahead. The web page layout by UBooty Had a complete table in a web page & all components arranged in different table cells & rows. So if u want to delete extra components & resize the table -> IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE â€¦ It resulted in Long web pages even when the content was merely 2 lines long â€¦..  I tried relentlessly, only to find wall straight ahead n a head bang â€¦.  I was getting frustrated â€¦ Never ever I was so much annoyed with myselfâ€¦ Damn it... I thought â€¦ It was a simple web page â€¦ and I used to deal with Goliaths of C++, Visual C++ and .Net. I shut down my computer & relaxed on my bed. Deciding to forget everything bout that website.  I couldnâ€™t concentrate anywhere else. Not even my favourite Yahoo Chat â€¦ Where I love to play All Star Counselor. Self Proclaimed Shrink. Iâ€™m chatting for last 6 yrs now & Iâ€™ve seen all kinda peepz here. Straight forward, Backstabbers, weak hearted, Wicked, Timid, Brash, Liars, Candid but there is a line of similarity which passes through all of them. They all need A Life Saving Support System.  Chatting is an addiction like any other addiction. When you get weak, When u loose control over ur life, When situation overpowers u, When you pass the reigns in the hands of Destiny n decide to enjoy bumpy ride in the back seat â€¦â€¦. You need someone, something, some way somewhere to rekindle past or Just to tickle yourself with the past without accepting the present tense hence trying to be someone who could have looked like/behaved like/been like this one in the past galore of glories.  Chatting gives you the same satisfaction. Freedom of being someone you are not, you were, you want to be, you always wanted to be or someone you never can be. It answers an impeding question, why do peepz visit Dance Bars or such filthy places. There for a piece of currency, they can enjoy the pre-eminence.  Power, Control, Freedom â€¦ Addictions give you everything for those split seconds â€¦.  Maybe Life is like a Carrot hanging in front of a donkey... Like u n me ... So we run in the Great Optimistic mood in the Hope of catching the carrot which furthers with every step.  My website creation lead me to the point where I felt I couldnâ€™t do anything to improve my situation. Suddenly, a thought kissed my cerebrum. Iâ€™ve done so many things before & toyed with all these tools. Why canâ€™t I do this again?  I studied the whole layout again. Understanding the base concept... I created my own web page using layoutâ€™s graphics. WOW â€¦ It was piece of cake then :P  It was already morning of 6â€™th June.  Yesterdayâ€™s French Open Ladies Final was a Drag. Two inexperienced players playing in historic grand finale for the first time n one awed  by the situation, second one in the same seat but holding both the handles. Thank God , It ended. Anyways, Congrats to the Anastasia Myskina. Well Now her name is taken from Russian domain. She looks like a Mink though.   I started developing my website rapidly. My information, scorpio graphics .. all were in place. I wanted a big page for all links section which I placed categorically. Linkin those hundreds of websites was a neck breaking task, still I managed it. Due to sheer anticipation of website completion & a Gentleman named Mr. Ralf Luve.  If you know Mr. Ralf Luve, congrats. Let us draw some inspiration from this german. He works as a Systems Administrator in an Internet Service company in Germany. He is 32 yrs old. He is married and HE HOLDS 5 GUINESS RECORDS !!! Huh .. Lemme tell u bout his latest one â€¦ Have you ever heard the term â€œ Rubic Cubeâ€? Imagine solving it in 5 minutes â€¦ What? Simple? Piece of Cake? Rookieâ€™s Delight? â€¦ Well How bout solving it in 5 minutes â€¦ BLINDFOLDED â€¦HA HA HA â€¦. See thaâ€™s the gr8 thing bout him. He did it. Gosh â€¦ I was spellbound, enthralled,  awestruck, agape â€¦.. everything at the same time â€¦ Mebbe I wonâ€™t act such even wid Ms. Pamela Anderson Live In Person n Naked â€¦.  Talk bout Mind over Matter & this guy was amazing. It proved Mr. Albert Einstien right, who used to use 40% of his brain. We are better than any super computer. Only we should know ourselves.  Remember the Dialogue from THE MATRIX ->    Donâ€™t think you areâ€¦ Know you are â€¦ !!!     It pushed me & finally I was able to finish my website. Still one last glitch was waiting. Counter on my main page. As I moved my site from yahooâ€™s geocities (provides 25 mb) to 125mb(provides exactly same 125 mb), my counter was gone. It was important to me in a sense of contentment. I searched again n again â€¦ found several free counters â€¦ registered with them .. result -> A counter with an ad. Again I was looking towards the window of melancholy. But as I was already stirred by Mr. Ralfâ€™s otherworldly record, I decided to write my own counter. Which I precisely did with the help of My favourite Microsoftâ€™s website. Thaâ€™s why Iâ€™m an Ardent Fan of Microsoft.   Long Live Microsoft.   "
13737,3426788,"02,June,2004",2004-06-02,"   Despair, Depression, Desolation, Dereliction, Delinquency â€¦â€¦ I was suffering from all of them at the same time, in different forms.   I looked out & saw the glistening Full Moon above. It was clear in my mind. I ought to feel like that way. It was on of those days of the month again â€¦   Full Moon day & No Moon day .. are so close to my life. If I found myself solemn than required & mulling over everything again n again â€¦. Itâ€™s gotta be those days in month. Iâ€™m not lunatic. Iâ€™m not ruled by any extraterrestrial creatures. Though Iâ€™ve faith in the God & supernatural powers, Iâ€™m skeptical enough not to take things on their face value.   After all Iâ€™m in technology field where everything happens due to something or everything has a valid reason. Everything is causal in this world. Well not everythingâ€¦. Iâ€™m a bit psychic. All Scorpions are â€¦. By the way no marks for guessing .. Iâ€™m a scorpion â€¦ On the border of Libra and Scorpion but I identify myself more with a true good Scorpio with itâ€™s The Eagle variety (Read Sun Signs: Linda Goodman).   But I know the exact point when this process of thinking n getting poignant was triggered. It was the conversation with my lovely friend, Anu, over 3 hours and 39 minutes. She is the exemplary whacko, punk, care free, unabashed teenybopper. The best part is she knows how she is n why she is. Well we all were in our teenage. To know that precisely is the best part bout her.   I still remember the time when I was in 10â€™Th or in 11â€™Th or in 12â€™Th. The world was outright black or white to me. Nowadays the world certainly is not a rainbow but smeared, blurred, smudged combination of everything.   Morales are something yesteryearâ€™s people used to care for (n how foolish they were)â€¦ Value is something only currency notes have. Virtue is the word somewhere in dictionary.  Why different games like Soccer, Rugby, Boxing, Tennis, and Cricket are interesting? Because they all are played with certain RULES. Or else , a night club brawl, a street fight, a riot can be considered as various forms of those games. Same way â€¦  Life is interestingly worth when it is bound by some rules. Nowadays the only rule is to break the rule or bend it.I ainâ€™t acting like a moral inspector or an eighty yr. old guy who has seen enough n enough scenes.  Suddenly everything you are not supposed to do are means of enjoying life. Everywhere I go , I get the same answer â€¦ I want to enjoy my lifeâ€¦ I want to experience everything in my life once â€¦. Huh... Hail... Lame excuses for smoking, boozing, doping â€¦ lol do I say something bout SEX??? (Scorpions are not supposed to say anything against SEX)  Forget bout Conversation with Anu, she has to experience so many things. Consider my good old friend Sanjay, who is at least 10 yrs elder to me. I hear the same lines in the same tone every time â€¦ then may be it is in bar or a pub or at any other damn place. I keep on smiling to them n for myself â€¦ Cuz nowadays Iâ€™m being seen as someone who is the biggest fool alive â€¦ goodness gracious reason : I donâ€™t smoke. I donâ€™t drink. I donâ€™t dope and Iâ€™m always the only one to drive all of my friends home when they are intoxicated above all permissible levels.  Life is getting fast & instant â€¦ So Iâ€™ve decided to write blog once in 2-3 days & decided to stop for today.   "

I got in some trouble in November and lost my last job, the judge gave me 6 months to pay my fines...Well 6 months is up in 3 weeks and I haven't paid anything on it yet. Finally I get a job $8 an hour second shift .....My shift starts at 3 in the afternoon. Its a meat packing plant I get to put hamburger patties in boxes all night, its a brisk 48 degrees in there but it didn't bother me as much as I thought it would. Most of the people are nice but have no since of humor and the place is cram packed with good lookin girls. At that point most guys would think 'heaven' good lookin women walkin around with T.H.O. all day. Yea that's great and all but I like to know what time I'm gettin off work. This stayin till 230 in the morning just aint gonna cut it.....If I didn't need this job so bad, trust me , I wouldn't be going back tomorrow. I'll tell ya this though, I sent out 3 resumes today before I left for work , let one of them places call me back and I'm out of that hell hole and never looking back, and if they don't call then as soon as these fines are paid I'm gone any ways. My girlfriend probly thinks I'm out cheating on her. I doubt she's gonna believe that they don't tell when you are getting off work until its time to go...Well I got my gripe out for the day, yall taker easy and remember it could be worse.  "

16971,3428326,"15,June,2004",2004-06-15,"   yep , I've screwed myself again . I'm currently on probation for my second D.U.I. , 16 months worth and a years suspended license . I live 15 miles from every where which means I'm driving while I'm on this suspention . Well I have to get a job to pay for my fines and costs . To make things worse they want me to go to alcohol classes  and  AA meetings , all well and good except the classes are 3 times a week and the AA is twice a week . That's 5 days a week I'm gonna be in counseling , 5 work week days . The classes are 6 pm to 9 pm , when I start working I'm gonna be working second shift , 3 pm till 11 pm , at least 5 days a week . The problem is this , if I don't get a job and pay , I go to jail , if I don't go to counseling , I go to jail . I have only enough time to do one or the other , not both . Well , I have to see the counselor on Wednesday at 10 am , hopefully we can work something out and make this work or I'm just gonna have to tell my P.O. to fuck off and do my time in jail , which I believe is 6 months (not sure on that one). Well the people are home and I got to get this published and get off here.  "
16972,3428326,"10,June,2004",2004-06-10,"   yup I'm still alive....not that any of you care , but here I am. My puter crashed shortly after my last blog, up an runnin again as you can see. I lost half my shit tho and dunno where the other half is . I didn't think I was gonna be able to find my blog again. I got 2 checks in the last 2 weeks , $75 a piece , drank them both up when I should have sent them to my probation . Have to go and see them bastards today , hope they don't throw me in jail . Broke up with my girlfriend last week (giver take a few days) she called beggin for me back , tellin me she was sorry for blowin up at me over hearin a female voice in the background while I was on the phone with her . If she had ask me what was goin on before she cussed me and hung up on me , she would have know that it was my buddies ole' lady and not some chik she imagined I was seeing . That's ok , I think she is gonna give up on being jealous... I hope , heheheh. Never the less I gave her a second chance . Got a new job , worked 1 day was late the 2nd day by 15 minutes , the supervisor said it was kool but not to let it happen again but the temp service that sent me there called me and said that my assignment was finished and they didn't want me back , I'm gonna go ahead and show up on Friday and see what happens . The worst they can do is send me home . Been washin trucks with a buddy of mine tryin to make extra money , I didn't think he was gonna pay me but he dropped off $50 yesterday . Just in time too cuz that gives me just enough cash to fill my gas tank and pay my P.O. for the piss test he popped on me 2 months ago ... yayayayyyayay!!!  "

I don't think i have d reason for making this... but i just don't wanna lie to you 100 percently (haha) therefore now i'm saying dat i'm kinda inspired and i kinda know what's my true objective on involving to such a thing like this and i think it's kinda awkward doing this in an awkward time of an awkward day... It's just bcoz of my self-made criteria: 50% for fun and 50% for some sort of things that pushes me to finally show my feelings, experiences, views, etc...         Suddenly I think there should be a side of me who can at last reveal my long time (not so long..hehe) suppressed self... I realized dat i'm already racing near to the next stage of life and that made me think that i should already begin adapting myself into the grown-up ones and avoiding my childish ones... I think this may seem too serious but i realized it's not! It's just the reality... and nobody could escape from this reality. Instead, we should stand firm and face this ""reality""...   "

So why should I feel bad for being boring... I am only human right?  Well if anyone every reads this, I'm telling you.. you gotta read Walden.  It is so delicious.  I've worn the pages of that book out in the last 5 years, but I can still crack it open and sink right in.  I know some people who don't read.  I mean, like ever.  Never one book all the way through.  It makes me what to scream at em'.  Well what's it to me anyway.  I've got this friend Stacy, and she is the coolest girl ever.  She was the first girl I was friends with in a platonic way.  I was driving a truck over the road and lost touch a bit, but she called me today and I forgot how much I really miss her.  She has a serious boyfriend now and that could suck, but he is totally cool too.  His name is Andy and he is way cooler than most anyone I know.  Together they are some super couple of coolness.  Well.... ah.. yeah.. cool   "
12345,3434961,"23,May,2004",2004-05-23,"    Good morning my happy little blog.  Today is a day of triumph!  Having been unemployed for two weeks this very day the growing frustration with my goal of getting out of the rent trap and buying a few acres to spread out on getting further away instead of nearer has forced me in to a frightful position.... I am updating my resume.  Yes, folks time to get a job.  Now I have mentioned my lack of marketable skills.  I am a college drop out with experience in retail, restaurants (cook), general construction labor, and driving big trucks.  Ah, how I hate all my previous jobs.  A necessary evil I suppose.  Well, in other news I have decided that perhaps the meaning to this game show of life is to attain perfection.  I mean to do each and every act through  out your day to the best of your ability, the best you can.  To care with your whole heart about what you do, and to not do what you do not care about.  Caring is key.  The thing is I am no perfectionist and am constantly doing things I care very little for.  Ah well, maybe I'll just go back to bed... I care about that.  You know I haven't really wrote anything except for my dream log in years.  There's been no letters, for at least a year, no poems in perhaps 2, no story's in maybe 4.  Not that I have other been a prolific writer or have any hopes at being a published work or something, but it seems important to keep on writing for some reason.  Doesn't it?  Well, now I got this blogg I guess.  An online journal that people can read and comment on.  You know that's kinda weird, but the anonymity makes it OK.  WHO ARE YOU!  Heh heh.  Well, I guess once I break the crust loose this all won't feel so forced.  Well, I have made of list of things to accomplish today ( besides updating my crappy resume )so onward I go into the loving embrace of responsibility.... ah so warm and tingley   "
12346,3434961,"23,May,2004",2004-05-23,"    Lets, see where to begin.  Ah, yes at the beginning, I am a 24 year old, un (and frequently under) employed male with few marketable skills.  I enjoy old classy cars, old rusted jeeps, music, art, organic gardening/homesteaders, building with wood and stone, philosophy, cartoons and long pillow fights on the beach.  I am a confirmed book worm brainiac resulting in few meaningfully relationships.  I type slowly, mis-spell words frequently and generally have nothing of interest to say.  I have never ""blogged"" before but, just like drugs I have decided to give it a try.  Today I attended my local church, made a peanut butter and jelly (I also forgot to mention my love of the culinary arts), drank half a bottle of moderately priced wine and enjoyed the final Simpsons episode of the season (worst episode ever).  My favorite authors are Thoreau, Emerson, Pirsig, Eliot Coleman, Helen and Scott Nearing, Rob Roy, and Steven King.  I have large ambitions but a much less than required drive to achieve them.  Some day I hope to own (as much as you can own land you pay taxes on) a small homestead where I can garden, read, contemplate, make music, create art, and learn to do all these things in a holy way so to touch god....or something.  I have managed to save perhaps half of the required money to buy land in the area I am looking and am somewhat excited about making a change.  Well, that's a big enough run on paragraph so I will close here and check to see what my blogg page looks like, if this new fangled technology works, ect... thanks for useing a moment of time you'll never get back to learn a little bit about me, your friendly neiborhood shut-in.   "
21479,3435900,"27,May,2004",2004-05-27,"    On my way to the city yesterday I saw a really bad car accident. The kind that you aren't really sure that everyone will live through. There were like 3 or 4 ambulances and fire trucks and so on. I didn't look for details because I would have fainted and caused another one. Well this nasty accident reminds me of how good we really have it here. Sounds stupid but... In 1998 I was in Nigeria. It was still under military rule and just to drive a few miles down the freeway you were stopped, questioned, scared shitless, and extorted for as much as they could get from you easily. They all carried machine guns you know the ""I will fucking kill you "" kind. I never saw anything like it. OK OK to the point. I was traveling at night from a small town called Ile Ife to Lagos. There were 6 of us in an older Mercedes, so it was a full car. As we were going we hit some traffic on the freeway, it was dead stopped actually. I could see a fire on the other side of the freeway and heard people screaming. As we got closer to the fire I could see a minivan on its side engulfed in flames. The driver of the van was dead, on fire, his body still in the position on sitting even though it was laying on the ground. I was sick with panic and then it just got worse. People that were in the van that had escaped with their lives were walking along the side of the road crying bleeding, their clothes ripped off along with some of their skin. I started crying and begging my husband to let some of them into the car. Like I said it was full really full I was on his lap in the front seat. I said lets get out and let Daddy take them to the hospital.  This was also in the middle of nowhere. The sides of the freeway were virtually jungle and there was nothing within miles and miles. Like I said before its not the safest of countries to be in to begin with and not the best place for a  lone white woman to be standing in the middle of the night along the side of the dark spooky animal infested jungle. Still I wanted to get out. I wanted those people to have my seat. I couldn't convince anyone that my idea was even close to sane. Humph. For once my whiteness was an issue. I said ""where in the fuck are the ambulances goddamnit!"" Well my husband being from Nigeria as well as the driver, his uncle, they were not fazed as I guess they are accustomed to watching people die HOLY FUCK SHIT MOTHERFUCK. The passengers in the back seat were 2 of our friends from El Salvador and my father in law. I was LOOSING MY SHIT, while everyone else was mildly irritated. I said give them money at least and my husband said something along the lines of ""If you give a monkey a diamond he has no use for it"" his ass is notorious for having some dumb ass shit to say at the most inappropriate time.  We eventually passed the accident, we passed to injured crying,DYING people, and drove off towards the next stick up station that for the first time in weeks was way way too far from where I wished they were.  That was over 6 years ago and I still feel sick at the thought of it. There are many many things that I learned on that trip but this one really makes me appreciate something I probably took for granted everyday of my life before that trip. I mean we all kinda think we have it good here but you might not really ""know"" how good we really do have it.   "
21480,3435900,"25,May,2004",2004-05-25,"    How is it that someone so adorably cute and wonderful can actually be the casing of what I can only equate to a tasmanian devil with a severe crack addiction? Well my daughter (2) has a runny nose and woke up last night at 1am and wanted to come into my room to sleep. I am slightly retarded and thought poor baby come sleep with mama. Well lets just say that after a full night of twisty turny kicking snorkles I managed to get at best 2 hours of sleep. Damn cute genes can trick me into anything. Humph.  OK I have to say it. I am a faithful watcher of the Sopranos, I have been since the first season. OMG is all I can say after Sunday's show and watching it again last night. I mean we all knew that it would eventually happen but damn, I mean really damn. I am fully comfortable with all the shit that is done on this show but I don't think they have ever done a show that the ""victim"" knew that they were on there way to well the end. It was just dirty and I never thought that Christopher would be so in on it. Wow. The power of a fictional whacking. I'm still bothered by it. I love this show.  Another kind of strange thought that has been going through my mind is a recent visit to my great Aunt in San Diego who just turned 94. I took my son (18) and left my daughter with her dad, and my mom also came along. Well lets just say that at 94 she is not exactly a full blown racist but she slips up and says some funky ass shit from time to time. I know that she tries to bring her remarks down when I am around because both of my children are bi-racial and I have, well lets just say I don't have the ability to not talk shit to anyone when they get all stupid and act like ignorant asshole racist fuckwads. She informed me that the little ""colored"" clown on her table was given to her by a neighbor. A not really ""colored"" neighbor but a mixed up one. She then went on to make the watermelon comments to which the younger members of the family never heard, as in black people love watermelon, and they (the younger kids)who by the way seem to think that they ARE black but are almost clear they are so white, went on to say that's not true they like 40's and rap music. I cant believe that I actually am related to such idiots.   "

I have suffered with major depression all my life and I finally decided to go an try some different medication. Well its GREAT its better than that even. Its called Lexapro and if you haven't had some get on some, well that's if you are depressed I guess. I mean I love it, I am so fucking happy I am singing happy songs. I feel like a superhero. I am seriously thinking of changing my name to LEXAPRO! I cant ever remember being so completely content. I have taken several things over the years but woo hoo this is it. For now anyway. So I am back, I will be back reading all my favorite blogs, and starting a cult to worship the ""drug"". Life is good.   "
12059,3441506,"27,May,2004",2004-05-27,"   I'm here at work, and I was just sent on An Errand. The errand was to pick up a book from another office, the Foreign Languages Department, here on campus. And so I did, and it was a nice walk in the soupy heat over to this building, which used to be called Lakeside. I'm glad they changed the name because there is no Actual Lake, there is only a pond, and you can tell whoever came up with the building name knew it wasn't quite right, but he or she couldn't very well call it   Pondside  , for that name would be completely unattractive. (""Yeah, I've got to my next class over at    Pondscum ,   I'll see you later...."")   Walking into the old Lakeside is like entering a freezer. On the second floor, I wander up and down the halls a few times looking for Room 278, feeling like I'm in a labyrinth, new halls and doorways appearing everywhere, students and university employees peering curiously at me from their desks. And then I find the office, finally, and I step inside, and I look around to see how    nice    it is in there. Look how    nice    it is. Lit by corner halogen lamps rather than overhead flourescence, the dim office contains two Ecko-ish desks facing each other, spotless ceiling-high shelves, new flat-screen computers, carpet that is flat and institutional, yet pleasing (color-wise) to the eye. The two ladies working there maintain pleasant conversation with a very pregnant co-worker, speaking in low tones before breaking off to ask how they can help me today.   ""I'm here to pick up a book?""   I feel so young. I feel, incidentally, just like I have in past jobs where I have been sent on errands to obtain Important Things from Older, Wiser People. People with Real Jobs who looked at me, the cute, slightly meek office ""helper,"" college-aged and hourly-waged, one day destined for Bigger, Brighter Things. A college education, even more schooling, amazing job, nice house, beautiful family. This will be me.   Except now I am 26. I have my Master's degree (from this very university). There will be no more school. And, at least for this summer, I am still the Office Helper.   What comes next?  "

23595,3451587,"25,May,2004",2004-05-25,"   A novel from the 70's. Part of a series that kept going and going and going... This first story seems the most thought provoking. The others probably just develop the theme. I don't remember them either. More after I read them again.  The theme is...machines are evolving much quicker than the biologicals (which create the machines then die out). The trend is helped along by the machines sending out recon ships that report back.  A visitor to our Solar system, called a Snark by Nigel Walmseley(sp?), comes and goes but leads Earthers to a crashed ship in the Moon which may have aided human evolution 1 million to 1/2 million years ago.  A plot twister though is there have been a series of novas on a direct line in the direction from which the Snark came...suggesting that something is blowing things up.  "

Where do they go to do that?  Jennifer, maybe you can get Big Mom on the Tonight Show. That would be fun, eh?  No fishing Jeff. Nobody wants to go fishing.  What are ya'll going to do anyway?   "
23599,3451587,"08,July,2004",2004-07-08,"   Hey...Last week I met with my first girlfriend from Middle School.  What can I say, my heart panged and my mind paused again.  Sigh. Even after more than 30 years away from the place, she stopped my heart again.  I wrote a poem.    35 Years Later   Yeahâ€¦I saw her at the reunion.  After more than 30 years, I saw her and my heart dropped, stopped 	and started again.   My life as I knew it was ended. The careful fiction built up all those years  	crumbled.  I turned back to the stumbling boy who lost his heart.  We talked of nothing.  What to say?  Even back then, she had gone on with her life. I tripped myself into a bounding farce of dope, drink, exuberance, 	ribald humor, and buried depression.  You canâ€™t grieve what you wonâ€™t admit exists. You canâ€™t grieve what isnâ€™t there. Blah. Blah blah. Blah blah blah blah.  She didnâ€™t remember the princess ring. Or the two rubber bands or the cork. Our Christmas.  Her mother liked me? She liked my mother? What?  She thought  I wasâ€¦what? I never knew.  Now? What?  "

They talk to each other, and talk and comment on what you say, if they pay attention to you at all.     &nbsp;   They don't listen well, they spend the whole time talking and laughing with each other. They ignore what you say, and ask each other how to do the activities. Often trading the wrong answer back and forth.        They come late; they leave early. &nbsp;   &nbsp;   And they Cheat!

8661,3454992,"30,May,2004",2004-05-30,"   Over on Frank Smith&#8217;s blog I found  urlLink this post  on Peter Laughner&#8217;s review of Lou Reed&#8217;s 1976 album &#8220;Coney Island Baby&#8221;. I agree with Frank that the review is, perhaps, &#8220;the   greatest piece of rock criticism ever written&#8221;, but, unlike Frank, Coney Island Baby is   not   one of my favourite Lou albums. I did, however, recently purchase on eBay a magazine advertisement from the launch of the album, but only because I think the title track is one of Lou&#8217;s best songs which is, as  urlLink Mark Deming from AllMusic  has said, &#8220;a song about love and regret that was as sincere and heart-tugging as anything the man has ever recorded&#8221;. The last line of the song and album, &quot;You know I'd give the whole thing up for you,&quot; grabs me by the short and curlies every time.              &nbsp;         Back to Laughner&#8217;s review. He suggests at the end, that if Lou was serious about the last line, he should do exactly that and stop making records. I&#8217;m personally glad he didn&#8217;t, as much of my inspiration today comes from Lou&#8217;s songs and his approach to his craft in the last 40 years. Perhaps, although I&#8217;m sure Lou would deny it, reviews like this one and the catalogue of reviews from Lester Bangs, may have fired Lou to keep going when many of his contemporaries either died, burned out, or started writing pop songs? Although I find much of his work hit and miss, when he hits, he really hits. It&#8217;s worth the wait. I would love to write songs with that honesty, that sense of poetry."

6290,3460713,"29,May,2004",2004-05-29,"   Lately.. I've been thinking about happiness and what it really means. Whether it's something attainable or simply just a state of being. But then the more I think about it, I look back at my life and ask myself whether I really am happy. For a few days, I had been confused. I just wasn't sure whether I really was happy, trying to be or plain unhappy.   Luckily, I was able to overcome this big fuss over my own happiness. I thought to myself that I shouldn't be thinking of myself all the time. I mean, I need to be at least a little selfless at times and quit thinking of my personal pleasures by trying to look around my environment and see if they're also happy. When I said my environment, I didn't mean just anyone. I had to start with the people I knew. Is my family happy? They seem okay but you'll never know. So I thought about doing something to cheer them up a little. I sent my mom a little sweet quote just to tell her that even though I'm quite far away, I still do remember her and appreciate everything she's done for me. Then I thought about my friends, I had a lot of acquaintances being disguised as friends but to those people whom I can really call ""friends""... well I can name a few. How are they? Are they alright?! Well, good thing I went bonding with this friend of mine last week. We went to the gym, then we ate at her place. Anyway, I haven't seen her in quite a while and it's nice to catch up on things. It's ironic how opposite the two of us were during the first semester, we sort of had a little indifference because we didn't have much in common, but now, we even go to the gym together.   Anyway, I've learned that when we talk about happiness, it doesn't have to be you alone. I mean, a bunch of cash and a new cellphone would make me happy.. but I've realized that a day with my ""G"" in Greenhills just browsing around the tiangges is even better.   You see, money or material things could never ever replace happy times with your family, loved one and friends. And now that I've checked on everyone I care about especially my ""G"", I know there may be problems once in a while, but the fact that I've showed them that I'm just here no matter what and that I will try to make them happy, that also makes me really happy.  I don't have much money right now, actually, I'm more than running out.. but the smile on my face couldn't be much bigger because ""G"" is making me so happy these days.   So I would rather cry a thousand times and be happy afterwards with the one I love. Rather than to smile when I want to and cry in the end. I know it's not only me who wishes that.   Happiness starts from you, but it doesn't have to end there.. it goes around and is being shared by more people.  I hope I made sense. If not, let me make it short.. I really am happy now, and I hope you will be to. Take care.   "
6291,3460713,"28,May,2004",2004-05-28,"   Trust had been such a big issue with the relationship I'm having right now. You see, when we were just starting, I had already gave my trust to him. Sadly, he had broken my trust. What's more sad is, it had happened too many times. It's partly my fault because I allowed him to toy with my emotions, and I didn't punish him for breaking my trust. But you see, it's not that I'm being such a martyr but a matter of not giving up. I never gave up on him and our relationship no matter how many times he had hurt me. I still tried to look on the bright side and I didn't lose my faith in him to change.  Fortunately, I see a big change in him right now. I know it has to be a two-way thing. Actually, I hope he really does trust me as much as I trust him because that's going to help a lot. Lately, he had proved to me that he's trying everything he can not to hurt me anymore. And I'm so happy for that. It is indeed a wonderful feeling that I simply could not trade with anything else.  So I keep on praying and hoping that my trust in him will not be put to waste. I see his efforts so I really wish he would keep it up. Because if we only try everything we can not to break each other's trust, there wouldn't be a problem.  It's just so nice to have someone to love, someone to trust. :)   "
6292,3460713,"27,May,2004",2004-05-27,"   Yesterday, I had been robbed while I was doing a little shopping at the ""tiangges"". Its was partly my fault, I have to admit. Because I already knew that the place was dangerous for a girl like me to be roaming around alone. And yet I still went there, alone. So, I had to learn my lesson the hard way.  Though I lost my money, like what my loved one told, it was only ""money"" and not my life. So I had to be thankful that nothing more dangerous had happened to me. As for the love of my life, well he scolded me for being stupid. But I know he means well, I deserve to be scolded. It also means that he really does care for me. I felt so bad that I had lost my money because I also felt so stupid. So I asked him to fetch me, and he came. My savior! Hehe. I felt like a damsel in distress waiting for my knight in shinning armour.  Anyway, I must be really lucky that day because nothing more dreadful happened to me. It was a lesson learned.. I had to pay the price, but as they say, no price is expensive enough because at least I was safe.   "
6293,3460713,"27,May,2004",2004-05-27,"   Something keeps me smiling all day long.. I don't know why, maybe I do It doesn't matter as long as I'm smiling... oh baby, I love you It's really not a matter of what makes me smile... but who makes me smile It's my baby, he makes me so happy.. that I can't help but smile  Sure sometimes, he makes me frown a little.. but nevermind He makes me feel a lot of thing.. it's coz he's always on my mind I know we're going to last forever and that really makes me smile We're not one of those couples who would only last a while  Baby I'm so thankful for the smiles you give to me Even though you're not around now, I wish you could see That this smile is because of you, you make me smile all day I simply am thankful that you're here with me everyday! :)   "
6294,3460713,"27,May,2004",2004-05-27,"   Today, my pride within me was tested with my loved one. I need not relay the whole story, but the incident that happened to us today had proved a lot to us. Not only to our relationship, but also to how much pride I am willing to swallow for my loved one. I'm not saying that someone was right with what had happened, no one has to win the argument. So I just tried my best to fix things as soon as possible so that it wouldn't grow into a bigger argument. I wasn't trying to escape the long dreadful argument that was yet to happen, but I was trying to look at things on the brighter side by swallowing my pride and see where the argument might lead. And just like that, things got better. If I had not thought of a more peaceful way of solving things, it really would have gone worse. But that would only be useless if there really was a better way. So as I've said, today my patience and my pride was tested, and I think I aced the test.   "
6295,3460713,"26,May,2004",2004-05-26,"   Relationships need to be conventional. True, everyone might be vying for that stage where in everything seems to be at the right place and time. Yet, wouldn't you think it'd be boring that way? Believe me, if keeping a relationship with someone or being a good partner was so easy, love wouldn't be that special. It'd just be like, mineral water or jello.. no offense to jello lovers.   My point is, when you and your loved one has been given this title of being unconventional, as long as you two still love each other, there is nothing wrong with that. Because it may only mean that you're keeping pace with each other in this fast-paced world that we're living in.   * I have no idea why I had felt the sudden urge to write about unconventional lovers tonight. Though I'm still proud to be writing about love. As for my personal relationship with my one and only ""G"", I think our relationship may be a little bit unconventional. But that's what makes it more exciting and that's what will test us to be stronger each day. *   "
6296,3460713,"26,May,2004",2004-05-26,"   If he wasn't here with me right now, I'd probably be dead. No kidding. Before I met him, my life had been filled with false pretentious and superficial happiness. It was like I was stuck into the hellhole and there was no way out. Yes, my life was sad. Meaningless. It looked fine from the outside, but from the inside, it just wasn't good.   Before, love wasn't much of an issue. I mean, I have loved before but at such a young age, I had been fooled and hurt too many times that I thought ""true love"" really didn't exist anymore. Pretty mushy huh? But when it comes to me being in love, there is no limit to how mushy, dramatic or sensitive I may become.   You see, there are a lot of things I can say about the love that I have right now. One of them is when I consider love as an art. Like a sculpture being made just for me. My love for ""G"" is truly an art. He is my masterpiece. And he saved my life!   "
4527,3463044,"26,May,2004",2004-05-26,"   I've decided that I need to write.  Like drinking water or getting sleep, it's something I have to do.  I am better when I put words down, and while I prefer the act of longhand on paper, I'm going to try this medium in order to hopefully do it more frequently, more consistently, and more creatively than I have been able to do until now.  My spiral notebooks have become coloring books for Mackenzie and scratch paper for David.  The computer is safe, for now, and the idea that the blog is out there, even if no one knows about it (at least not yet), will compel me to write and add notes.  What I plan to write about is completely up in the air.  My husband, my kids, my life, what I hear and see and read, what I do or don't do, it's all food for the writer in me that I hope to channel into something productive via this medium. "
4528,3463044,"17,June,2004",2004-06-17,"   Apologies to all, but only stay-at-home Moms (or Dads) are going to get this column.  I mean no disrespect to the many working parents out there, I used to be one, too.  And I know you're with your kids on the weekends, but you're just not going to get this column.  I have two kids, nine and three.  David is from my first marriage, and consequently has some stuff to deal with, which has gotten easier as he's gotten older.  Suddenly, in the last three weeks or so, the maturity level has gone up a couple of notches.  Don't get me wrong, his room's still a mess, I get the eye roll at bed time, I still can't figure out how the water gets out of the shower when there are two shower curtains to keep it in the tub, etc., but he's become attentive, doesn't argue as much, accepts direction and finishes a project before moving on, I'm almost sad (I said   almost  ), I think he's growing up right before my eyes.  Mackenzie is my three year old and from my second marriage.  She is amazing to watch because she is so much like my husband and I, throwing back my own words at me can be sometimes hard to hear.  Her preschool teachers constantly tell me that sometimes they forget she's three because she articulates her thoughts so well.  She idolizes her big brother and he adores her, but they are brother and sister, and when that fact comes into play, it can be ugly.  David is home for the summer, school has been out for a couple of weeks now.  Mackenzie is in preschool three days a week, mornings only.  So today I had both kids home this morning.  David had day camp at school at 9:30 a.m, the same time Mackenzie had her swimming lesson across town (Mom didn't have her organizer with her when she scheduled this mess).  It therefore was imperative that we leave our house clean, dressed, and fed by 8:40 a.m.  No one wanted to get up, no one wanted to get dressed, no one liked my breakfast choices.  St. Vincent de Paul was coming by to pick up the remnants of the garage sale leftover for donation, and I needed to get that stuff out of the garage and leave it up front for them to pick up.  The dog and parrot both needed attention. And for some reason, today was the day my phones started ringing at 8:00 a.m.  David has pulled himself together and I ask him to get himself and his sister in the car.  Mackenzie is all over the driveway, running from flies (our newest fear) and not getting in the car.  David has made the valiant attempt and I tell him not to worry about it, I'll handle her.  At the precise moment he decides to swing the door closed, Mackenzie decides she better cooperate.  Her hand didn't get caught, there were no broken bones, but she did get some skin scraped on the edge of her finger.  She proceeded to cry about her finger for the next four and a half hours -- all the way to David's school (20 minute ride).  All the way to the YMCA (25 minute ride).  Through the entire swimming lesson (30 minute class).  Over to dad's office (20 minute ride).  At dad's office (a very quick ten minutes).  Back to pick up David (35 minute ride) and drop him off at a friends house (10 minutes).  (Now here I must interject the next piece of good fortune.  At dad's office, we utilized part of our visit in the bathroom, she is fully potty trained and I haven't carried a diaper bag or a change of clothes in at least six months.  As she went to the bathroom, I noticed she had what I'll call RB (short for Runny Butt, I'm sure you get the idea).  I'm surprised, she hasn't had RB in a while, and I'm chalking it up to the fact that she's made herself so upset this morning.  I've tried a variety of things at this point to distract her from her pain and get her to smile and nothing is working.)  After the friends house, I decide to take Mackenzie to a local park close to the friends house, thinking I won't have to make the big loop around when I pick David up in a couple of hours.  It was hot, so I decided to take Mackenzie to an ice cream store, counting on the sugar to give her energy at the park and make her happy and give Mom a break because the last nerve was about ready to blow.  She smiled.  Things were good.  Just as the ice cream got to the table, we had major RB.  She lost it again.  I haul her into the bathroom and survey the damage.  It couldn't have been much worse.  I had baby wipes but that was it, no change of clothes, no diapers or underwear, and she's screaming the whole time.  Chucked the underwear in the trash, not salvageable given my current situation. Washed out the pants from the inside, had her put them back on, and I slid baby wipes and paper towels around her bottom.  Cleaned up the bathroom as best I could.  Got my drink to go, left her ice cream (more screaming) and back home we went (25 minute ride).  Changed her at home, caught my breath for five minutes and back for David we went (25 minute ride).  Picked David up and now it was time to take him to his dad's house, he's there every Thursday (35 minute ride to dad's).  Poor David, he pretty much sucked up to his sister every time he saw her, and she still wanted nothing to do with him -- he tried singing to her, making funny faces at her, telling her jokes, I felt bad when he reached for her hand and tried to kiss it and make it better, she completely blew him off.  As I walked him to his dad's door, I told him not to worry about it, she'd be better tomorrow when he saw her.  Let's hope that wasn't an extreme stretch of the truth.  When kids have diarrhea, the things you worry about most is dehydration.  You've got to keep the fluids going down their throat, the idea is to get the fluids in faster than they come out.  Of course, the job is twice as hard when they don't want to take them in at all.  By 3:00 p.m., I was on my way to the doctor's office, she just wasn't right, the constant crying was starting to worry me even though it didn't sound like the pain cry, it was definitely the wimpy cry, but nonetheless, it was time.  And going in to it I knew there was no medicine I could give her, nothing to stop the RB, but I had to try something.  She blew twice while we were there.  (Thank goodness I picked up a change of clothes.)  While the doctor told me lots of stuff I already knew, he did mention something I didn't.  Since he figured out her particular case is viral, he said it would be contagious and adults could get the same thing, but in a much milder form.  Hmmmm, double extra hand washing for me.  Called the husband to tell him what was going on, and was told he had left a little early, had said he was feeling a little tired and run down.  Hmmmm, he hadn't mentioned that to me when I talked to him earlier in the day.  We got home, and there he was lying down on the bed, said he didn't know why he didn't feel so good.  I did.  Why do I direct this column at those stay at home parents?  Because this was one of those days that all these things were going to get done and not a darn thing got accomplished.  Now the health and well being of my child is paramount and my life can go to hell as long as my kids are OK.  But what was shaping up to be a good day fell apart so quickly.  My laundry is still on the floor.  The dishwasher is still loaded with clean dishes and the sink has dirty ones in it.  My kitchen floor is, well, let's not talk about my kitchen floor, OK?  My coupons are still on the table waiting to be cut and sorted and my bed didn't even get made this morning (but I don't think the husband cared when he came home and rolled into it) and I didn't even cook dinner today (again, not high on Keith's priorites right now).  I know I didn't do a damn thing today and I feel guilty and useless.  So it was a surprise when David called me from his dad's, to see how Mackenzie was feeling and to thank me for taking him over to his friend's house today.  And Mackenzie announced to her dad that she didn't want him right now, she wanted Mom because I had taken care of her all day.  I went to bed thinking I had done a good job for today after all.  And maybe if I get up extra early before she wakes up I can unload the dishwasher and fold the laundry, etc. And if she wakes up early, well then we'll just cuddle in Mom and Dad's bed for awhile. "
4529,3463044,"16,June,2004",2004-06-16,"   We had a garage sale this past Saturday and I'm happy to say we netted about $450 for a day's work.  We have one every couple of years when there's too much stuff and not enough room.  I'm sure as my kids get older the frequency will diminish, right now my kids are still young enough where we're trading up (crib for twin bed, big dresser giving way to smaller dresser plus desk, etc.), and my house is overrun with the small things of infancy and we're almost through toddlerhood at this point, so from time to time the expulsion of all these once needed necessitiies is paramount to ramaining sane.  David had 343 remote control objects of various sizes and shapes, how many can a single person control with just one pair of hands?  (David's original answer -- 343.  His revised answer after my anger started fogging up his glasses from three feet away -- 342).  Mackenzie had so many young child toys, stuff she got on her own merits plus some of the good ones I saved from David little kid days, they were everywhere.  I had kitchen paraphernalia I don't have a chance to use anymore, Keith had a bunch of really nice polo style shirts with lots of big names on them, but since we've been working out his shoulders and arms don't fit in them anymore, plus other stuff that was once vital and alive, but now gathers dust waiting to be used again.    The decision to discard one's own stuff can be either heartbreaking or made without a second thought.  Some of the kid's stuff was easy to put in the discard pile.  Some brought back memories of a child's face, lit up like Las Vegas, and for just a minute, you think if you hang on to the item, you'll hang onto the look on that child's face, maybe you can bring back a better time, a happier time, an easier time, you choose the adjective.  Coming to the realization that it's just stuff, and the past is just memories can be hard to deal with.  Then you have to price the stuff, and it's agony again as you try to put a value on your memories, or worse, a value on your taste.  Five dollars for that!  I paid thirty dollars seven years ago when it was new and before everybody and their brother had one!  I told David that whatever he contributed to the garage sale would be his money if it sold, but if I pulled items from his room and I sold them, the money would be mine.  Even my nine year old suffered from the stress of his decision making, I could hear him rationalizing about the train he got for Christmas that year, or how that car was his favorite gift from his dinosaur themed birthday party.  In the end, he did contribute about a dozen items, in a range of sizes and shapes and ultimately made $16.  I'm not much of a garage sale shopper myself.  There's a time constraint involved, plus the fact that I can't do much shopping with a nine and three year old around, it puts the damper on shopping of any kind.  When I lived in Southern California, a garage sale might net a great Disney find, or a piece of transferware to add to my collection.  Here in Idaho, the chances of that Disney find are more rare, and while I might be able to find something of value worth my time, it's not high on my list right now.  I wanted to sell my stuff Saturday morning, but it was a great way to watch people for awhile. Watch and see what they were looking for, watch them and see them criticize my stuff, and then of all the injustices, watch them as they turned their nose up at my valuable stuff.  What do they seek among my discarded memories?  I watch them and wonder -- what are they looking for?  Are they trying to replace something they once had?  Are they looking for a more inexpensive version of something?  Having been on the extremely tight and fixed budget at one point in my life, I can certainly understand shopping with quarters and dimes, but was still taken aback when I actually saw my former self buying a small toy for a child.  A two dollar toy with one dollar being scraped out of the ashtray holder in her car.  I used to do the same thing for french fries for my child, and often couldn't scrape the lousy 99 cents together.  And it wasn't that my child needed french fries everyday, but I wanted to be able to provide them.  I took her money and put the toy in a bag for her, and as she was leaving I offered a couple of cookies to her child, who eagerly shot out a hand.  They were cookies that I was selling, a quarter a piece.  As she went to stop her child (she had seen the sign), I told her if it was OK with her, it was OK with me, it's hard to say no to a child and I had been giving them away to kids all morning long.  Maybe it was just wishful thinking on my part, but I think she understood I had been there once, too, and let her child take the cookies.  My husband said he thought I was going to just give her the toy.  I told him that I wouldn't haven't robbed her pride from her for anything.  To me it was a two dollar toy, but that child needed to see his Mom buy that toy and hand it to him, and she needed to buy it and give it to him.  He was so happy in the back seat of his car, clutching his new toy and wiping cookie crumbs from his face.    A simple reminder that one person's trash is another's treasure.  That toy brought my daughter joy and I'm glad to see it continues to do it's job elsewhere. "
4530,3463044,"05,June,2004",2004-06-05,"   I suffer from migraines.  I have since I was about sixteen.  So seeing as I'm well into over twenty years with them, I consider myself an expert on the subject.  I've read everything I can get my hands on about them, I know all about the latest pharmaceutical inventions in order to seek relief, I have a personal list of how and sometimes why I get them, and how to deal with them when they attack.  And yet with all my knowledge about them, and even what produces migraines in my own head, I still suffer their agony.    Sometimes, the pain is on one side of my head, sometimes it's the other.  It can be in the front or in the back of my head.  And that is where the differences end.  My migraines are always an unrelenting throbbing pain, I literally can hear the pounding inside my head echoing through my ears.  And while I wait to see if my medication will do me the favor of easing my pain, I assume gymnastic positions in order to put pressure on the offending part of my head.  I'm in the dark, because the most miniscule drop of light on my eyes is nothing short of blade-like steel being pushed through my brain.  My eyes are closed, I pull a blanket over my head, bury my face in the pillow, and yet I still see light -- damn that knife!  The medications are at once wonderful and frightening.  I remember when I could take one Vicodin and blissfully sleep for twelve hours on just the smell of the drug alone; now, I take two Vicodin and stay awake long enough to feel the headache burner get turned down from scorch to simmer before I sleep for a couple of hours.  I've been through a handful of drugs to help in easing my pain, some didn't work for me at all, some worked great until my body refused to allow them to do their job.  My body, rejecting what could save it from the headache inferno, deciding instead to suffer the pain until something better comes along.  At times, I am powerless, and I must seek the attention of someone with more power than I have, someone who can give me what I need and quickly.  The doctors string me out often enough, having me answer their stupid questions  (can't they see I am an expert in the suffering of migraine headaches?)  before giving me the relief I seek.  Their medicines are much better now, I feel the immediate effects of tranquility and know that when I wake later there will be no drug hangover for three days.  Why do I write about my migraines?  Because I had one yesterday, a small headache that ibuprofen had no effect on, which through the course of the day started developing into something that could have undermined my plans for the weekend.  I was at the point of the second to last step, when thankfully my medicine decided I had had enough for today and slowly eased its way back to wherever it is it comes from.  And I think about my migraines and wonder why.  Why did yesterday's migraine retreat after just a minor skirmish?  Why didn't it stay and fight, like it has so many other times, and win?  Did my body have something in it yesterday it didn't have before, something that turned it into a killing machine against the headache ravage?  If so, can I figure out what it was and bottle it, to save for the next attack?  What possible use could there be for having a migraine headache? "

Upon our arrival, we spotted George from the Checkers and headed inside where we were showered with free Stoli..(wink!).  There were lots of shiny booths there like tattoos and free hairstyling and amoeba..    Suddenly, I got some hair goop stuck on my hands..Heads turned as I squealed..until this guy took it off and put it on his mohawk. I realized that hair styling should be left to professionals only. So I let this cool girl named Cazzie style my hair while the suicide girls were on. Those suicide girls have a van you know. It is silver with SG on the side..I thought it stood for s'cool girls..but I guess not. Anyway, we headed for the balcony where we began our evening of being kicked out of places. I got kicked out of at least 6 different places.Oh and the Like's lead singer gave me the skunk eye.  So after they kicked me off the roof for the second time..we decided to head out and look for better trouble.   P.S. If you are wondering what else I was wearing besides heels..you'll have to look for me in the weekly.   "

157,3469665,"28,May,2004",2004-05-28,"   Ok, so yesterday was better. There is just something about getting out of work and home by noon. It always brings a insipid smile to my face. So anyway, I got home, stripped down and hopped in bed. I've got one of those beds with a pillowtop mattress...I added a feather bed on top of that, covered it with 300 count Egyptian cotton sheets and then put four more down comforters on top of that. It makes for some happy heavenly sleeping. Anyway, I got up after a solid three hour nap, fought with my family on the phone and then went to my Brazilian ju-jitsu class. Talk about an ass whooping. Good grief. My upper body didn't stop quivering until after dinner. It was an odd sensation. Anyway, after my class I went to my favorite grocery store, ordered a yum yum sandwich and headed back to my apartment where I sat cross-legged on the floor and ate. My best friend was there too, we were too tired to do much more than gossip feebly. I was going to meet up with the guys to go mountain biking, but I hurt too much. I wanted to go, but then again, I'm still a bit skittish about my lack of mountain biking skills.  Today I have duty...for those of you who are unaware, duty is a cruel and unusual punishment the military dreamed up to ruin perfectly good weekends for Armed Forces members. Someone has to be on the ship at all times and we each take turns on a rotating basis enjoying this special form of torture. So I'm here, sitting, hoping I can sneak over to my room and take a nap, wishing I could go home or at least get outside for a bit. Maybe I'll eat lunch outside.   This is what I hate...you get this bullshit line about joining the Navy and living an adventure, but in reality you're going to spend months on end staring at the same people, watching the same four walls, hoping that maybe if you're lucky they'll let you at some port for a day or so. Even better, they're repeating the same ports over and over and over again so you're really not going anywhere new. By the time I get off work, (when we're in home port) I'm so desperate to see light and have a normal life that I end up staying up almost all night, just so I don't miss a second of my freedom. Only 3 years and 2 months and 5 days to go until I'm free again. *sigh* I guess I'd better go find somewhere to take a nap.   "
158,3469665,"27,May,2004",2004-05-27,"   So I'm sitting here at work, watching people slog back and forth and for the life of me I can't figure out how I wound up working at a place so mundane. I would give anything to be outside right now. It's just hot enough with just the right amount of wind. I wouldn't mind hitting the trails for a run, give my legs a stretch. Maybe I'd grab my bike and work on jumping stuff. I'm supposed to go mountain biking with a friend this Tuesday, but the gap between my experience and his is vastly embarrassing. He's sweet enough that he pretends not to notice (even when I randomly throw myself into the bushes...damn those clipless pedals!) At least he's a good sport!  The trail I've been riding is beautiful. I've been running/riding it for months now, watching it turn from a dull, dead ashy brown to a vibrant, dripping green. I feel like I'm watching a nephew grow up. The down side of all this fecund, viral growth is that the bugs are out in full force. Though I've eaten my fair share, I am apparently not slowing their prolific procreation habits at all! They bounce off my sunglasses, my shirt, dive into my hair and get stuck to my sweat/mud covered legs. *shrug* At least I'd be outside.   "
159,3469665,"08,June,2004",2004-06-08,"   Two weekends ago, I haphazardly stuffed my pack, grabbed my best friend J and headed for the woods. I picked a section of the Appalachian Trail for our little three day hike and J reluctantly acquiesced. We drove for about five glorious hours, through some of the most adorable towns I've ever seen. These were the kind of places that didn't even have a McDonald's and had names like Cuckoo and Gordonville. We finally made it to the mountains, laced up our boots, threw on our packs and hit the trail. Little did I know, this backpacking trip was going to change my life.  Right after we got on the trail, we met a guy named M. He was headed to Rock Spring Hut, only about four miles down the trail. I decided that we weren't going there because I didn't want to be deluged with other hikers. After a few hours of hiking I changed my mind. You see, I've always wanted to hike the Appalachian Trail and I figured that it would be a good idea to hit up this hut so I could meet other thru-hikers and nose around through their packs-to get a good idea of what I would need to buy and all. Anyway, we turned down the trail to the hut and set up camp on one of the pre-prepared camping flats (which actually wasn't all that flat...) Before all this, let me tell you about the trail. I'm in love with backpacking. I don't know what it is, but it has a lot to do with being outside, breathing truly clean air and waking up to birds singing. It's idealistic I know, but I wish I could live out there. Anyway, this hike was the same sort of thing. Huge rock formations, narrow trails, the legendary white blazes on tall beautiful trees. There were open meadows, clean streams and wildflowers everywhere...what more could I ask for? I sped ahead of J, only because I enjoyed the solitude and because I can haul ass when I want to. I always sat on a boulder and waited for her though...to her credit, she kept up well.  Back at the Rock Spring Hut...so we are setting up camp and talking away with TJ and WL, two guys who were setting up camp too and we all decided to eat together. Everyone pooled together their food and shared hot dogs, avocado dip, chocolate and all sorts of other yummies. One of the best things about backpacking a lot is that you can eat whatever you want and as much as you want-you're burning 3-6,000 calories per day anyway.  The other thru-hikers were hilarious, a product of long periods of loneliness combined with mile after mile after mile of solid physical exertion made them talkative, friendly and informative. I got lots of great advice and even better, received a trail name from TJ (if you didn't know, thru-hikers use pseudonyms while hiking to sign the various trail books along the way.) After dinner and a lot of beer (I shared M's vodka and gatorade,) we all went to our tents. Right before I drifted off, I heard, in a loud voice, ""YEAH, I WAS WONDERING IF I COULD GET A TAXI TO COME PICK ME UP TOMORROW..."" I started laughing. Being the smart-ass that I am, I couldn't resist shouting up the hill at M ""AND COULD YOU GET HIM TO BRING A PIZZA? EXTRA CHEESE?"" At this point, the other hikers started laughing as well. Who brings a cell phone and calls a taxi from the AT? Fortunately M had a great sense of humor and we all had a good chuckle over it.  The next morning as we were packing up, one of the thru-hikers, WL asked if he could join J and I on our little lap around WhiteOak Canyon. We agreed to drop him off further up the trail so he wouldn't be behind schedule. We started off, adding another hiker to our party, JB which had our group topping off at four hikers. We found the WhiteOak trail and headed down it, WL and myself darting ahead. After a while we came upon our first waterfall (WhiteOak has a concentration of waterfalls which is why I originally picked the trail-I probably should have equated the waterfalls with immense changes in elevation, but I wasn't thinking that clearly!) Anyway, we got in our bathing suits and hopped into the chilly/freezing water for a little refreshment. It was great...there is nothing in this world that beats a dip in a waterfall, followed by some sun-drying on a rock, followed by some lunch cooked over a camp stove, followed by some more hiking. I was in heaven...honestly I could have stayed there forever. Anyway, we repeated our little swimming trip two more times, each time, hurriedly stripping down and jumping (against our common sense,) into a pool of frigid water. At this point WL (S) and I had discovered that we had tons of things in common including a trip to DC planned for the next weekend. We agreed to swap phone numbers and hang out when we got there.  The hike was a tinsy bit harder than I thought and J was ready to beat me senseless when we finally got out of the canyon. She was even more angry when I shot down the suggestion that we stay in a hotel for our next night. I did concede a hot dinner at the trail restaurant, but I could tell she wasn't happy with me.  Anyway we hit the trail again, this time rushing to find a place to camp before dark. After nearly running down the trail, S found us a spot and we put up our tents by headlamp. We each grabbed our booze and sat on our sleeping pads, getting good and drunk to the sound of light rain falling on the canopy of leaves over us. Finally J went to be while JB, S and I took a drunken night hike to a nearby outlook. We sat there for a while, watching the stars and finishing off our booze and then we stumbled back to our tents. The next morning, J took off early for the car while JB, S and I packed everything up. As we were walking to the car, I invited S to come stay with me in Virginia Beach (he said earlier that he missed the beach a lot,) and I'd drive him to DC on the weekend. After a short hesitation, S agreed and headed back to the car for the ride home. We dropped off JB at his truck, swapped e-mail addresses and said goodbye through the misty morning air and J,S and I drove home...TO BE CONTINUED...   "

Then i thought it must be 1 of the cats, spike was asleep at the bottom of the bed so i thought oh its molly and went back to sleep. when the alarm went off and i told mick it dawned on me that ot couldn't of been molly as she doesn't make any noise when she trots around. It deffo sounded like a person treking around......... spooky!  went to the loo at work only to realise i had a huge toothpaste mark on my pretty pink 'hello kitty' top! wahhhh! i franticly rubbed at it but to no avail its been there all day, taunting me!

Okay, well, that's not entirely true because I do work and accomplish things in the a.m., but I just don't like to launch into any involved projects before lunch. So, my morning consists of responding to emails, planning and activities for the week ahead, returning phone calls and reading any materials circulated round the office. Ususally we have a staff meeting which will take up 1 or 2 hours which works out perfectly because by the time the meeting is out it's usually around noon or 1 pm. On the upside, at least my coworkers know me well enough to avoid engaging me in any lengthy conversations on a Monday morning. If they do, the sound of my 'morning voice' will likely make them think twice before doing it often. I have nothing against mindless chatter; it's just that I tend not to be chatty in the mornings. Of course, anyone reading this probably knows that about me already.    Today I just got back some pictures from my trip. I have yet to join the those who partake in the instant gratification of digital photography so I had to wait for my film to be developed before I could see that half of the photos I took are in fact pure crap. I love taking pictures, documenting friends and events so I can look back and fondly remember that yes, I did enjoy the time I spent (wherever, whenever) and could probably tell some crazy fun stories to go along with the pictures. So, it's quite a conundrum really as to why I haven't jumped on the digital photography bandwagon. This most recent vacation has propelled me to change that. The morning that I was going to leave for Germany, I discovered that my trusty camera, the very same one responsible for all college photo albums wrought with debauchery and embarrassing moments for all was broken. I then had no camera available to me! How could it have happened that I had been living my life, in this modern world, in a hip city, with no photographic equipment what-so-ever! You see, I come form a fairly (camera) trigger-happy upbringing. Every member of my family has at least 2, more likely 3 or 4 different cameras, yet in some state of obvious irrationality, I convinced myself that the extras were clutter and I didn't really need them.   In any case, I shall now embark on the search for the perfect camera. Never again shall I allow myself to be the victim of a disposable camera and it's featureless offerings!  "
19283,3471740,"09,June,2004",2004-06-09,"   Believe it or not, every once in a while I like to leave the Bay Area. As you all know, I love San Francisco, Berkeley the Bay Area (which, in case you hadn't heard, does not include San Jose). I also love traveling and every time I return I appreciate what a beautiful and unique place San Francisco is.   Germany was a lot of fun. Kim, Marty, Oliver and I went to quite a few places around southern Germany in the sweet Mercedes Benz we rented. I'll have to get some pictures and post them. Unfortunately, it rained on and off for most of the time, but I think I still got some good photos.  Some of the highlights were the beer of course!; seeing the many castles scattered throughout the hillsides; Rhine River boat cruise, visit to the Porche factory (where I tried to get a job as a test driver- unfortunately, that didn't work out); Baden-Baden (spa town with mineral baths and swanky shops and a casino); driving through the Black Forrest; visit to Frieburg, which is actually in the Black Forrest, has a really cool brewery, the 'old town' has intricate cobblestone-mosaic sidewalks and streets with open gutters- which I should mention, you must be careful not to step in while walking back to your hotel drunk from the brewery; we stopped in Fussen to see the fairy-tale castle; and then onto Munich! Munich is the type of place that I need to go back to. It's a great city with lots to do and when the weather is nice you can fully appreciate the parks and the beer gardens.   I also picked up a little German. Here are a few phrases I found helpful while there (spelled  sort of  phonetically for ease of pronunciation):  ""Bitte ein bier?"" (say with a cute smile to the bartender as an apology for poor pronunciation)   Please, a beer?     ""Bitte ein bild?"" (say with a cute smile to a boy as an apology for poor pronunciation)   Please, take a picture?   ""shIza!""   Shit!   ""Fair-root!""  Cool!   ""Das iz fair-root shIza!"" That is cool shit!  ""Das iz koo shIza!""  That is cow shit!   ""Haben zie baden shaum?""  Do you have any bubble bath?   As you can clearly see- all very useful phrases.  So, for now, I'm just battling some minor jet lag and wondering when and where my next big out-of-country trip will be. I'll try to get some Germany pictures up on this blog soon too!  "
19284,3471740,"02,July,2004",2004-07-02,"   My co-worker Rob (who is my bosses boss and practically the head of my entire company) asked me to house-sit while he and his family went on vacation for 3 weeks to France and Italy. So I agreed to stay there (not because I'm a kiss-up, but because they have a cute house with a great remodeled kitchen in relaxing Menlo Park).   I was inexplicably drawn to the Viking stove and oven and All-Clad cookware. So, one evening I decided to get crafty and cook myself dinner. I had things going on the stove and something in the oven as well when I got a phone call. As I'm catching up with a friend, I suddenly realized that I need to check the oven, so I looked- and good thing I checked because it was on the verge of burning. I quickly grabbed the towel hanging on the oven handle, take out the pan and see that the towel now has a hole burnt in it approximately 5 inches in diameter.   I immediately ran it under water to stop the burning. Made sure that I was not on fire and that the house was not on fire. I told myself that accidents happen and a towel shouldn't be too big a deal, right? Immediately following that, reality and my usual level-headed logic set in. The truth is, this was not a 'normal' kitchen towel. It was a fine cotton towel with embroidery on it with flowers and writing which said 'a gift from France' or 'a touch of France' or something along those lines. This towel obviously came from France and had some sentimental value that I would never be able to quantify. Of course, now I'm back to freaking out because I think they must have got it on their honeymoon or it was passed down as an heirloom in their family or someone brought it for them as a special handmade gift- the possibilities were endless!  I knew I wouldn't just be able to walk into Williams-Sonoma and get a replacement so I consulted the wisdom of a select group of trusted friends. Some of the great advice I got was to just throw it away, never bring it up and hope they think they lost it themselves. My other option was to just tell them the truth and offer to replace it. This seemed like an empty offer to me because this towel was obviously something imported and they had had it for a while. But in the end, that's what I went with and hoped that they wouldn't take me up on it because then I'd probably either have to go to France and find someone to recreate the embroidered design.   How does this all end you ask? Well, I too have been full of anticipation and today, Rob is back from his trip. He hadn't said anything about the note I left or the towel when he came in, but I knew it was only a matter of time.   I had to go down to his office to get some things signed so I told him in person that IÂ’m sorry I ruined it. And he tells me he was thinking he would give me a hard time about it and tell me that his wife's grandmother gave to her on her deathbed. I think all the blood and color must have left my face at that point because he followed up with a ""no, really, it's zero big deal and donÂ’t even think about replacing it."" Whew! He also mentioned that he's glad I didn't burn the house down. And of course, now they want to hear the story- which really isn't all that interesting. I'm just glad it's finally all over with.   I wonder if I'll ever get asked to house-sit again...  "
2834,3471824,"31,May,2004",2004-05-31,"   And it is now math class. I just finished off a graph about crime rates, so I have a few minutes before I need to go back to class.  I'm considering quitting MUDwolf permenantly. It's not THAT good a game anyways- there's so many out there that are far better- and it's rigged. Rigged games suck. Especially when it's rigged against you. I'll NEVER become an Immortal, even if I do reach level 50 someday! And it's because of that little @#&*ing b#^&# Saskii! If I ever became an immortal, she'd whine and complain about not being one (she's been bugging magden for longer to become one) and if she becomes an immortal, chances are she'd kill me. Repeatedly. In the game, of course. But it's no fair! I've been working so HARD helping newbies and such, and Az, who never does anything but CHAT, just became one! I could scream for all eternity. What's the point of working to become a level 50 (and an automatic immortal) if I wouldn't be permitted to become one anyways!?   "
2835,3471824,"28,May,2004",2004-05-28,"   Just another really boring morning. Once again I find myself sitting here at this same computer, trying to pass the time between getting off the bus and my first class of the day. And yet I have never been able to shake the realization that my friends are off talking to their real friends outside in the halls. I can't seem to forget that they'd rather be with other people.  MUDwolf is seriously unfair. I've been helping snivelling newbies for gods knows how long now, and still I'm not even considered for immortality. Whereas Azuriel, who does NOTHING but chat all the time (seriously), has now become one. I deserve it way more than she does! I actually DID something. But nooooooooo. Supposedly it's because of that b**** saskii...   "
2836,3471824,"28,May,2004",2004-05-28,"   Like I said already, I can't think of a title. Ho hum.    My life is it's usual depressing, irritating self today. One good thing is that I found out what I needed to do in Pokemon gold today (hey, the story and show suck, but the game isn't all that bad. Plus I don't have anything better to do), which is defeat the gym leader in Goldenrod city. I could've sworn I already did that...but everything in the game itself seems to disagree. Ah well, it'll be a snap anyways. My quilava, Fred (I name all my pokemon monotonous, boring names for no reason at all), is around level 32, and all those people who challenge me have wimpy pokemon that are around level 10! Hah! Pathetic!  But enough of my gameboy rambling. It's probably boring everyone to death. Not that anyone would be reading this anyways... I wish I could fully retreat into my own world, just to get away from this torture called life. If this is all life is, then I don't want to live at all.  Whoever said 'better to have loved and lost than to never have loved at all' was just trying to make themselves feel special. It's exactly the opposite!  Just a few more hours of school left. And then I can go home! And go on the computer! Of course, I'm on one right now, but we're not exactly permitted to play games at school (well, duh. It's SCHOOL). Most people play games anyways, but that's usually when they're not in the classroom when the teacher is practically looking right at you. That's just asking for trouble. And I'm not too fond of getting caught playing games and being sent down to the office and getting a lecture from the vice-principle who probably doesn't even know my name or remember me. So I'm writing in my blog- hey, it's not like I have anything better to do. Oh, yeah, and I'm writing a list of roleplaying stereotypes, just to vent some anger. Here it is so far: Roleplaying stereotypes/clichÃ©s/over-done things 1)	Assassins 2)	Ridiculously attractive runaway elf princess warrior â€˜maidenâ€™ sluts 3)	Killing for stupid reasons 4)	Vampires 5)	Big, strong; masculine heroes who go off on whirlwind adventures and save the world too many times to count; screw half a million women who practically worship him; seduce some virgin empress, sleep with and then abandon her; Has rippling golden hair, perfect teeth and loads of charm; Becomes rich in the process; is a strong defender of â€˜goodâ€™; and has some magical sword with a long and majestic name. 6)	Mary-sues in any gender 7)	Young, heroic, brave wizards with half a million females madly in love with them   Yup, that's all I've come up with so far. And they all REALLY tick me off. Vampires and Assassins have to be THE most over-done of all those though. I mean, come on! In all the rps I've ever been in, only a handful of other characters have been something other than a vampire or assassin! Seriously, can't they be at least a BIT more original!? It's not like I actually go LOOKING for vampire/assassin rpgs and join them just so I can whine about how many of them there are! The only good rp I've ever been in with vampires or assassins is this one on Elftown called Lethargy. In that, there's a total of one human (Mortis), around ten vampires and/or assassins(Kula, Eve, Wulfgar, Gelina, Jahn, someone or other....), and only ONE character of another race- my character (Syth). And there's no-one playing an 'evil' character, aka antagonist. NO PC ANTAGONISTS! NONE!! NONE!!! ZERO!! NIL!!! Z- Okay, I think you get the point. Even Mortis, who is-or was, I can't figure it out- a vampire hunter, has joined the 'good' side with the rabble of un-original vampire characters! Well, then again, so have I. At least for now. If I feel like it later on, I might decide to throw a wrench in the good guys' plan and join the 'dark side'. My character is pretty flexible in regard to loyalties- nobody really trusts her much, and she trusts them even less. Oh, the joy of messing with other peoples' plots- OH, SHUT UP!!!!!!! Ahem. Sorry. One of the people in the classroom was being sick.  Like I was saying, my character's pretty distrusting. That's partially because she's anti-social. In most of the rps I join, I use Syth as my character. That's because I have a really lousy memory, and it's hard to remember all sorts of different character names for a million rps (I join alot of 'em. Yes, I need to get a life), so by using the same character for all of them, it saves alot of effort. Syth's a half-elf. Well, technically more of a half-demon...   "
2837,3471824,"27,May,2004",2004-05-27,"   Hello. To those of you who bothered to look at this, congratulations. Not like anyone would ever look here anyways.  This is the first post in my blog (well, duh) so if it sucks, don't complain. I'm not too good at this stuff (duh again).    I've created this thing for the sole purpose of being able to say that I own a blog. Yup. Not really any reason at all. No, wait, I'm bored, AND felt like having a place to go on and on about random things. Oh gods, I'm booooored. And angry. And depressed. I need a new hobby. Or a gameboy. Or both. But noooooo, my parents won't buy me a gameboy, or a game console of any kind! I'm lucky to have PC games. So I'm saving up to buy a gameboy. Which is harder than it sounds. You see, with an allowance of 10 dollars a month and the only other cash gaining opportunity being babysitting my little sister, I have to save up for a long time to get enough money to do anything with. Sure, I guess I should feel thatkful I live in a family that is well off and such, but oh well. I don't care. I don't FEEL very thankful at all. And my life SUCKS. Sure, it could be worse. I could be kicked out of the house and have to move in with the telletubbies. But it'd be pretty hard for it to get much worse short of a nuclear explosion nearby or something like that.   People don't make sense. I try so hard to fit in sometimes, I really do, but no matter what I do I just can't. I know I'm not like them. They know it too, and hate me for it. Well, that's how they act. I really don't have a clue what they really think about me. But their actions speak of disgust, of anger. I can't belong to this world. I don't know how to cope with so many things that life throws at me, and it's cost me so much. I'm beginning to think it's cost me my sanity.  Am I sane? Is this reality of mine some twisted path that should never be used? Is it 'wrong' to think this way? Even if it is, I cannot help it. I cannot change too many things about myself. There are so many things about me that I have no control over. And it seems I will never be able to control them. Yet all the other people around me can manipulate them flawlessly. Why does the world seem so alien through my eyes? It's the only one I've ever known, but is it fake?  Death. My biggest desire. I crave it's cold grasp, to be released from this shattered vessel and disappear into non-existence, where there is no pain. I want my life to be ended, and I want to be the one who ends it. And yet, I cannot. Something is holding me back from it. Fear. How ironic, that the only one preventing me from reaching my greatest desire is myself. My fear of pain keeps me from my death. Fearing pain is a human adapting, made to prevent us from potential danger. But this danger is what I WANT. I need the consequence of that action- after all, it is the only reason I would even consider the pain.  And so I live to see yet another day. Time passes strangely here in my own universe. A minute can seem like an eternity, while forever can pass like a second. So I don't know how long I've been isolated. Perhaps I am immortal and have lived for ages, or perhaps my existence hangs by a single thread and at any moment I could vanish. But I do not know. How can one know such things about themselves? Is it just me who is oblivious to fate, or do others know what will happen to them in the future? I suppose I shall never know. This illness keeps me locked inside myself, so that I can never escape to catch a glimpse of the world outside my cell. I seem to be spiraling downwards in a Maelstrom that I cannot stop. But what am I falling into? I cannot tell if this is insanity or sanity that I am approaching so quickly, but it seems that I will reach it soon, no matter what it is.  Is this real? Is my life a dream, a fantasy world created by who knows what? How I wish this was all superficial, that it never really happened. But how can I know? Even if I found out what this world is, it would probably be just another lie someone's using to manipulate me. Somehow I know that, even if this is a lie, it would change nothing. Even if I discovered this life wasn't real, I couldn't do anything about it. Why should I seek the truth when knowing it would not allow me to do anything about it?  Right now, I take things day by day, not thinking about tomorrow. For if I tried to think of the future, it would probably overwhelm me. I try not to consider the things that have the power to bring my world crashing down around me, because I do not know if there is any other world I could live in.   "
2838,3471824,"20,June,2004",2004-06-20,"   Happy father's day. Woop woop. Yaaaay.  Just had breakfast. No coffee. Not that I drink coffee anyways. Unless it's french vanilla. That stuff rocks! I don't have anythign better to do, so I'm posting. School's finally over, woot woot, and tomorrow (which is monday) I'll get to gloat, since everyone else in my family still has school (those of them that go to school).  I'm going to be dragged along to one of my sister's soccer games today, all the way on the other side of the city. The only thing more boring than sports is watching sports! I swear, I'm going to VEGETATE. Ugh. But nooooo, today's father's day, so we have to stay together today! I hope I can sue my parents for this... We had a party last night. A bunch of hyperactive kids were running around the house, not to mention annoying adults who took over the house and played bad music all night. They probably got drunk, too. And now I'll probably haveto clean up after the obnoxious brats who messed up our basement. Fun.   "
2839,3471824,"10,June,2004",2004-06-10,"   Why can't I ever think of a title? Ah well. Not like it's a very important skill. I mean, putting 'able to think up good titles on the spot' isn't exactly something useful you could put on your resume. But who cares? I'll just type in some random word or something I haven't updated in a while. I was too lazy, I think... Magden's going to abandon MUDwolf and start a circlemud game. Good idea, in my opinion. There's alot of really fascinating areas and such on the internet for circlemud. In fact, I downloaded the circlemud area creater (or AC) 9Don't ask why, I was looking for furcadia stuff at the time. Furcadia's boooooring. You can't carry more than one item at a time!). Maybe I could submit an area or something to him if I create it using the AC..... Too lazy to write more.   "
2840,3471824,"12,July,2004",2004-07-12,"   ...and so I live to see another day. Just got back from ottowa two days ago, on saturday. At writer's camp right now at the university.  &nbsp;Wraith's here too. It's nice to actually know someone in the camp ahead of time. Usually I would just hang around a bunch of people who didn't know me at all and probably liked me even less. But I've changed since then, and if wraith wasn't here right now I probably wouldn't even try to make friends. But she is here, thank the gods, so I don't have to. She's been a better friend to me than anyone ever had before. I'm really going to miss her... &nbsp; &nbsp;I'm dying. I can feel myself slowly fade away. By changing schools again, all my parents are doing is alienating me (they seem to enjoy doing that to me...) and tearing away what I've become. For once, I actually know who I am, and they're taking it away. I don't think I'll survive losing myself this time...   "
21897,3473164,"29,May,2004",2004-05-29,"   So, I got a little serious yesterday, and part of me wants to apologize-- probably the same part of me that is scared sometimes-- but I am not going to apologize.  Apologies, fear, and lack of faith in the individual are to be avoided.  Well, not all apologies, but... apologies for being serious and committed and a visionary.  You shouldn't apologize for that.  So there.  Just  urlLink breathe .    Today is my last day selling  urlLink MINI Coopers  for a baseball legend.  I never thought I would sell cars, and I never thought I would work for Hank Aaron, but now I have done both.  Life has a funny way.    Selling cars has taught me a good bit, including how to drive a manual, which makes me feel more competent as a human.  I have been driving a MINI, and now I have to give it back, which makes me sad.  My  urlLink real car  doesn't have airbags or a CD player and only the left-side speakers work, so I will be unsafe and without good tunes.  Here are some heroine hints to buying a new car: 1.  Say no to dealer prep fees, bank fees, and generally any other fee that is not included on the Munroney Label, the official label from the manufacturer that by law must be displayed in new cars.  These fees can be negotiated.  Now, most dealers do have a documentation fee, and here at MINI we never waive it, but there might be some negotiation at other dealerships. 2.  There is generally flexibility in the finance rate that an auto dealer offers you, so even negotiate your interest rate if possible.  Car dealerships want your finance business and will generally do what they can to gain your finance business.   3.  Be sure to thoroughly inspect your car when it is delivered.  Look for dings, scratches, etc.  This is not to say that they will be hidden from you, but sometimes even a dealership will overlook something, and it is better to take care of it before you leave.   4.  Do your internet research.   urlLink Edmunds  is a good place to start.   5.  Look at several dealerships.  Comparison shopping works well in the car business.   6.  Be nice.  Remember that car sales people are people too with families to feed, or in my case a cat, and for the most part they are just trying to earn their keep.  Most work on 100% commission.  7.  Buy a  urlLink MINI  or  urlLink Scion XB .  Maybe that will be of some help to someone, even though I don't think anyone is really reading my blog.  Which leads me to ponder how does one force people to read their blog?  Okay, well maybe forcing isn't really the right verb, encourage, how does one encourage.    I am feeling a bit nervous about being unemployed.  I will officially be part of that faceless 5.6%, but I will go voluntarily.  I was supposed to talk about Israel today, but I am busy trying to figure out how I am going to celebrate my last day at work.  Figures, doesn't it?    Maybe I'll  urlLink krump .  Watch a  urlLink movie .  "
21898,3473164,"28,May,2004",2004-05-28,"   Peace concerns me because I do not think that people should blow-up, shoot, maim or otherwise hurt each other if they are in search for solutions.  Death is not a solution; it is a sentence.  And, no one has ever been able to explain to me how violence solves problems.    The obvious answer:  ""Violence solves problems by killing everyone who is a problem and scaring everyone else who is thinking about becoming a problem.""  Interesting proposal, but it has never and will never work because there is always someone who is above fear, someone who is willing to die, someone who doesn't give a poot, and someone who fills deeply wounded by previous violence and therefore someone who seeks retribution.  Hasn't anyone watched ""The Godfather""?  Violence begets violence.  What are we supposed to do?  Sit around and wait to be attacked?  Well, here is an idea I have been kicking around.  Attack and death are inevitable as there will always be someone who does not value life. There are two answers to this sad reality.    One:  Go out and try to kill everyone who might try to kill us first.  Problem:  In the process of trying to kill all of the evil-doers, we kill some innocents, and these innocents have friends and families.  They are people that do not believe in violence and probably would have never taken up arms IF their loved one had not suffered needlessly.  After the death of their loved one, they become filled with anger and seek retribution creating a new threat that we (of course) must confront.  We (being America) send over our guys and gals in the army, and they heroically fight for our freedom.  Another group of innocents lose their lives (albeit voluntarily) and back home loved ones blame the faceless enemy.  Where does this cycle end?    The cycle breeds more violence than the status quo.  Regardless of what happens, there will be people who hate and people who kill, but meeting their violence with more violence does nothing to prevent these people from existing and actually increases violence because it transforms non-violent individuals into fighters.  Result:  We have the violent status-quo plus the violence we have bred with violence.    Net loss  Two:  Do what we can to prevent violence through non-violent means and educate.  Problem:  The argument goes that there are people out there who hate us and will stop at nothing to ruin our way of life.  They do not care if you are Democrat or Republican, peaceful or hateful; they want us all dead.  I grant that.  I concede that these people exist, but they will always exist regardless of what we do, and if there is any chance of changing them or making sure that their beliefs are not passed-on that chance does not lie in blowing up their countries and killing their citizens.  Such violence only supports their belief that we are dangerous, hateful people who need to be stopped.  Attacks provide fuel for their fire of hate.  Attacks win new recruits, recruits that previously were on the fence or did not want to be involved in the violence at all.    People say that war is the price of freedom; the death of a soldier is the price of freedom.  That I live in an ivory tower and take my freedom for granted while the sons and daughters of America sacrifice their lives for me.  And I say, wait one minute.    If I could bring back every soldier that is overseas, I would.  I do not want them there.  I do not believe they should die for my freedom.  I would rather take the risk of dying here because they were not there than have them assume the risk of dying there.  Simply:  I would rather die here at the hands of a terrorist because my country adopted a policy of non-violence than to selfishly demand the sacrifice of others.  I will die for my freedom, but I will not seek my death and I will not ask that others die for me.  Violence is not the American way.  We do not condone violence in lieu of the democratic process.  We do not condone gang warfare.  We do not condone preemptive strikes.  If we did, we would live in a ""Minority Report"" inspired landscape where people who were prone to commit crimes would be locked up.  Don't we believe in innocent until proven guilty?  So, how can we say that we are fighting for the American way?    Ahhhh.  I am tired.  There is more.  There is always more.  I didn't even get to the part about Bush and Israel or about education.  I was watching  urlLink ""The Dennis Miller""  show last night (What kind of website is that anyways?  It isn't even a website.), and a member of the panel said one reason he is voting for Bush is because he has been the most Israel-friendly president in recent history. Israel, another interesting topic when it comes to peace and the American way.        I wish I had some links for my thoughts.  It looks more exciting when there are  urlLink colors .                     Maybe, tomorrow.  Hopefully, forever.  "
21899,3473164,"27,May,2004",2004-05-27,"   There is this little part of me that wants to post a blank blog and that little part is fear.  Posting my thoughts, my ponderings, and rants seems a little presumptuous.  The act assumes that there will be a reader, and I am not really sure who would want to read.  Then, there is the other part that screams to be heard and demands she will be read.  I recently read an article about "" urlLink Blog Lit "" and I was left thinking, ""Well, why not?,"" which seems to be my latest approach to life.  At the age of 25, I am planted firmly in a ""quarter-life"" crisis.  The title again presumptuous as who is to assume that they will live to 100, but I did not create the label, but the category has created a new market segment.  And the segment has  urlLink a book, a website, and now a conference  .  So, the quarter-life crisis.  I haven't read the official diagnosis, but for me it means floundering about searching for a passion, scared that my life will end without accomplishment, working half-heartedly at jobs I feel are meaningless, and beating myself up for not being the 25 year-olds who organize  urlLink Bonnaroo  or the 15-year old who started her own internet consulting firm.  (Her name is  urlLink Laima Tazmin .)  Obviously, if greatness hasn't found me, then I am not meant for greatness.  That is what my quarter-life crisis dictates.  I have quit my job as a Motoring Advisor, aka MINI Cooper Salesperson, after quitting my jobs as an investment banking analyst for Lehman Brothers, a waitress for the Atlanta Fish Market, and a nanny for an unnamed family in Buckhead.  Perhaps my greatness is my ability to quit.  Somehow I don't believe that will garner great accolades in Horatio Alger's homeland.     But, I am here, and I too need to be heard, or perhaps I just need to be written.  And so it begins, the ponderings of a self-proclaimed heroine who worries about world peace, the rise of women, the fall of children, and how one becomes a Top 40 rock star.  "

18051,3479211,"28,May,2004",2004-05-28,"    No e-mail from hubby today so far. It's over half way through the working day and not a single e-mail.   Given that he normally sends missives five screens long, this is unusual. It means either   a) he is ridiculously busy at work b) he is still smarting over our argument on Wednesday night, after which we are still not speaking properly.  It's probably (a) and (b).   We argued because I had Wednesday off work without him. I fancied some time to myself. To hubby, this is a dreadful insult, that I could want time away from the wit & wonder that is his company.  I wonder if I should fire off a quick e-mail to him? I don't want the bank holiday weekend to be spent in silence.   Fired off a quick one saying ""how are you today?""  No answer. Still, at least  I've  made the effort.   Ten mins later. ""I am busy. Will be back later again tonight. Will get my own tea"".   Well, at least we're talking now!   "
18052,3479211,"03,June,2004",2004-06-03,"    Hubby has less money left than he thought, for the month. About Â£100 less. We share our money, although not in a joint account.   It's normally me who has less money than I thought, so this makes a nice change.  It'll be a flexible plastic friend month-end then - I think we'll have to do a medium to big shop tonight in Asda, then get some booze in Morrisons later on. I have bought two bags of frozen chicken fillets from cool-trader, so we can have stir-fry chicken with brown rice for tea in the evening. Cheap and cheerful. Well, cheap, at any rate. A bit of cheap booze from Morrisons and we'll make meals of it.   "
18053,3479211,"01,June,2004",2004-06-01,"    On Friday night I had the shock of my life. Hubby went out in - of all places - Wigan, with some of his ex-collegues. He had e-mailed me back last thing before I went home, saying that he wouldn't be out long.   Thankfully, Big Brother was on, and I have E4, so I could watch wannabe TV presenters make fools of themselves all night. It got to two o'clock in the morning and I got very worried. Hubby doesn't have a mobile, so I couldn't call him. The last train back from wigan left at eleven, and I knew he wouldn't get a taxi, because money was very tight.   Anyway, he rolled in pissed as Boris Yeltsin at half past two. I was a little upset; well, more than a little upset. I had had a few drinks myself, and was ""tired and emotional"" (as they used to say about aforementioned ex-president). I asked him where he'd been.   ""The train was cancelled, so I had to get a taxi."" ""So the eleven o'clock train was cancelled, and it took you three hours to get back in a taxi. Where were you? Birmingham? Wales? Leeds?"" ""Wigan as you well know. Anyway, I don't give a shit. You're a horrible selfish woman with really odd teeth and I hate you, trying to stop my fun."" ""So, I was sitting here trying to work out why you hadn't called, because you always do. I was worried that something awful had happened."" ""Well... fuck off. Fuck you. I'm not fucking watching this fucking shit anyway I'm putting a DVD on so fuck yourself.""  There is no point in arguing with a man when he is blind drunk, and you're tipsy yourself. Things get out of control. Horrible insults are thrown around.   I wonder if partners who go out know what the other person goes through? I'll tell you. It happens in stages.   1) Happens at the time they say they were going to be back. So in hubby's case, about half ten / eleven. Stage one involves anticipation. You wait downstairs so you are near both the front door (to greet them) and the phone (in case they call to say they'll be late).   2) Happens about an hour later, so in this example, about half eleven / midnight. Mild concern, and thinking up reasons why they might not have arrived or phoned. At this stage the reasons are along the lines of delayed trains, going for takeaways, popping into the 24 hour Asda on the way back to grab a Goodfella's pepperoni pizza.   3) Happens an hour later again. We're talking one in the morning here. Strong concern. The reason they haven't arrived or phoned gets less logical. The train has broken down, at best. At worst, a terrible fear starts to form in your mind. You try to shut it out. He must be okay. You wonder if his work salary package includes life insurance... 4) This is another hour later. He is definitely dead, or injured, lying in a road somewhere calling out for help.   This is normally the point at which he walks in, ten-pints-of-stella pissed. Your initial reaction is relief; he's alive! Hurrah! but after that, you're angry. Really angry. Seething with uncontrollable anger for the sick feeling in your stomach. Boiling over with rage for the hot tears in the corners of your eyes. Knuckles clenched and white, you shout, and shout, and shout until your face is purple.   Ever tried shouting at someone who is so pissed they might as well have had a labotomy? It achieves nothing! It makes matters far worse. You are a controlling evil witch bitch harpy tart slag who is trying to ruin his life.   Woke up Saturday with a very sorry hubby. I managed to get him to make me a coffee out of guilt, but I didn't want to milk it. I used to do that if he'd upset me; milk it for all it was worth; get a couple of days dishwashing out of it. Not now. I'd rather it was forgotten.   Anyway, we went out that evening to a Stone Roses tribute band and had an absolutely fantastic night!  On Sunday, hubby remembered something that had happened on his Friday night trip out... and started acting shifty and guilty. I knew something was wrong 'cos he was tidying the kitchen, and getting all huggie and kissy with me in a completely non-sexual way, which is normally a sign that something is wrong!  It transpired he'd made a pass (a quaint expression meaning tried to feel-up / snog) at an ex-colleague. A pretty 20 year old ex-colleague who, on being ogled by what to her was a dirty older man (hubby is only 26 but I remember what I thought of 26 year olds when I was 20) had, with her friend, immediately left the club and gone home leaving him on his own in Wigan in the middle of the night.   The guilt continued through Sunday. I wasn't at all arsed; he won't be the first or last bloke to make a pass at a younger woman when drunk and pissed off with the wife.   Why couldn't he feel guilty about the right thing? Why wasn't he overcome with shame about not calling me, instead of about something trivial like this?   Sometimes I don't get hubby one bit. Still, at least we're talking now.   "
21194,3481803,"30,May,2004",2004-05-30,"   Today didnt really do anything at all. I watched the Street Fighter anime last night and it wasn't too bad. Today I was gonna watch the ninja movie, but my tape player is missing. I think my mom took it with her last night (for some reason) and decided to leave it at her partying location.  I just played Rag all day, took a shower and washed my stank ass, and ate a fudgesicle. Life is peachy.  "
21195,3481803,"29,May,2004",2004-05-29,"   Today my dad woke me up at 7 (cant I get some DAMN SLEEP AROUND HERE!!?) and asked- no,  told  me to come help him install my aunt's new shower. It just started as a small leak in her tub, but now shes going nuts and demanding a whole new shower! Not to mention a new toilet and sink we've yet to put in...  We head to Lowe's to get some caulk so we can... caulk up the shower I guess. Somehow, we get up on a conversation about what construction vehicles my dad's operated over the course of his life. He tells me that he's ""rode just about everything you see on the side of the road"". I'm looking around: Doghouses? Trees? Garbage Cans? What the hell was he smoking?  Anyways, we're putting the doors on the shower and we realize that they're too big to fit the shower. So, my dad's stuck in the shower because the doors cant slide enough to make a big enough opening to get in/out of. I fall out laughing. Smokes pouring out of my dad's ears, like the demon he is, and i'm laughing my ass off.  This evening, the folks are off to some lady's birthday party. So, i'll be here alone. Again. On the computer all night. Eating cold pizza.  "
21196,3481803,"28,May,2004",2004-05-28,"   Oh yeah! Instead of  renting  a movie, I bought some anime on VHS for only 10 bucks!! I got  Wrath of the Ninja  and  Street Fighter II: The Animated Movie . I certainly hope the Street Fighter anime is signifigantly better than that live action bullshit movie they made sometime in the late/mid 90's. If you dont know what i'm talking about, BE GLAD! That movie damn near ruined my view of the Street Fighter franchise.  The Ninja movie, however, has to be good. You cant go wrong with ninjas.  "
21197,3481803,"28,May,2004",2004-05-28,"   Well, i'm bout to go get some pizza (mmmmm pizza) and maybe rent a movie if I have the cash. But first i'd like to record an asinine revelation I just had.  You know how your life is supposed to 'flash before your eyes' right before you die? I got to wondering, is this life? Or just the flash?  "
21198,3481803,"28,May,2004",2004-05-28,"   Well, I guess this is my blog. Im going to be writing down random stuff whenever I feel like it. If you manage to get here, feel free to read it or not. I really dont give a fuck.  Today is my first day off on summer break (wee!). It isnt really that great because i've miserably failed the grade, due to me missing somewhere around 50 days during the year. Personally, i'm just pretty glad to be wasting more time on the computer. Mindlessly staring at the glow of the monitor during ungodly hours of the night. Ahh, my sweet addiction.  Oddly, I didnt sleep in today. I woke up at fucking 6 and couldnt go back to sleep. I'm pretty tired now but theres better stuff to do than sleep at the moment. The first thing I did was start up the computer (naturally) and check out my favorite forums at  urlLink Animeleague.net .Nothing that new or exciting was going on there, so I hopped over to GameFAQs and voted on the poll. Since there wasn't shit to do anywhere and Kazaa was being a bitch like always, I decided to play some Ragnarok. After a few monotonous hours of killing creatures as a cute little swordsman sprite, I cut off the game and called up Rea (my close friend) as I promised her I would. We talked for 30 minutes then she went to go get some lunch. After screwing around back on the internet, I got the inspiration to start up my blog... and here I am.  "
21199,3481803,"02,June,2004",2004-06-02,"   Went and spent a day with my bud Cameron. He gave me a PS2 headset and i've gotten back into SOCOM 2. So, lately i've just been owning bitches and stuff online. You can find me on as ~Zombie~.  "
26792,3482303,"29,May,2004",2004-05-29,"    It's been a day of held back tears, feeling a bit emotional about things.  Not sure what though, maybe just a mixture of things.  The problem with me is that I can't talk about things, much to Donny's annoyance!  I used to be able to open up quite easily, but after a string of people using that to their advantage( most of them christians i might add ) I became more inward, just learned to deal with things my way.  So it's hard now to tell Donny whats on my mind, I want to, I really do, but somehow can't find the words when I need them.  It's just a matter of being less self-concience about myself, and with Donny reading me like a book anyway, I don't think I'll get away with keeping things to ( he's just handed me a note asking me to tell him whats on my mind ) myself!!!!  Suppose too, it's a matter of allowing myself to be open to hurt again.  Pain has made me grow as a person, but enough is enough, I've had a lifetimes worth, and I know with Donny, there will be no more.  Time to wear my heart on my sleeve again.   "
26793,3482303,"28,May,2004",2004-05-28,"    This is the beginning of a new blog and a new me. I have blogged before but it was way too depressing. This one will be much more interesting, probably the most talked about topic will be the wonderful people in my life. I will blog a lot about my new love Donny, who has taken me to places i've never been and it's an on going journey! I was single for 6 months after the break up of my marriage, and I have never been so grateful for my ex shagging someone else, as I would have still been stuck in a loveless relationship, hard though it was, I am me again, and it hasn't felt better. Not much more to say tonight as i've had a few glasses of vino and my brain wants to shut down for a while, also Donny is sitting here and I am feeling kinda horny. x x x   "
26794,3482303,"22,June,2004",2004-06-22,"    It's not been a bad week so far, got something to look forward to, we are all going to Donny's on friday, so my week is busy getting prepared for that, with housework etc.  Had a quiet weekend, on the phone and texting Donny most of the time so I didn't feel alone, really don't like weekends without him.  Last week of school till summer holidays and we are all looking forward to the break.  Got lots of washing to sort out so I'd better be getting on with it.   "
26795,3482303,"18,June,2004",2004-06-18,"    Didn't get to sleep till 4am, back up at 7.30 to get kids out to school.  Feeling bad about being a bitch to welshy last night, hope Donny doesn't get too pissed off with me.  Went to the shop after I dropped the kids to school and I passed right by strap on sally, as she passed me she laughed in my face, all I needed today, got in and just cried, I really don't need to be alone today.  I was going to just pack things up for me and the girls and catch a train to Montrose, stay at Donny's seeing his flat is empty, but I don't want to go without talking to him first,  just need to get away from this fucking place.  I haven't felt as bad as this for a long time.  I constantly feel sick and my head can't find any peace at all.  Can't even get in touch with Donny today as he is working.  Will phone him tonight and see what he thinks, was even thinking of going up on wednesday after Claire's graduation, the kids won't miss much on the last two days of school.  It just means I can get some space, I feel so trapped and out of control.  Might go and get a tattoo today, not sure what to get or where to get it put, but it's something to do. I pawned my wedding, engagement and eternity rings yesterday, didn't get much, they were worth as much as my marriage was.  I really need to get away from here and all the crap.   "
26796,3482303,"17,June,2004",2004-06-17,"    It's 1:38am, Friday morning.  What a fucking night.  Can't sleep at all with everything going on in my head.  An old friend of Donny's got in touch with him tonight, saying she wanted to be mates, he text me to tell me, as I had already experienced this bunny boiler at the start of our relationship.  He told her that he would speak to me, but to be honest, how could he even think I would like the idea, he should have just told her no straight away, but he gave her a foothold again.  So I got her number, and had a bit of fun, after the day I had, I needed someone to vent my anger at.  I basically told her to stop texting Donny, or I wouldn't leave her alone, turning the bunny boilers tables.  I know that Donny asked me not to text her, but he is too nice to her for my liking, so I can't say I was.  I am not usually a possessive person, in fact I really don't like possessive people, but after everything I've been through, I can't take any sort of threat to my relationship with Donny, I'm fearful of losing him to someone else better than me, cause lets face it, I am old and haven't got much to offer.  I am so fucking pissed off tonight, but in a funny way, when I get pissed off, I get strength from somewhere.  I am not a weak person, I just allow situations to weaken me when there is no need for it.  God I need sleep, fuck yesterday and all that went with it, I couldn't even get a proper talk with Donny.  Someone was definitely out to piss me off!!!!   "
26797,3482303,"15,June,2004",2004-06-15,"    I've had a busy morning.  Things I needed to do, but would have run a mile if I could.  My head is spinning with it all, and I really need to find strength from somewhere.  Its hard on my own dealing with lawyers and benefit departments, they just confuse me, fill me with too much information and everything I long for seems so far out of reach.  Divorce proceedings are starting which is a good thing, it means I can finally close that chapter of my life and make plans for my new life with Donny.  The sale of the flat is confusing as are all the financial implications of the divorce settlement.  I need to get a job, so once Claire is at school after the summer holidays, I'll start looking.  We want to live in Montrose, but it's all very complicated, how do I get a mortgage if I'm not working there, so I will have to live there a while first, so then where do we live until then.  The ideal thing, so that Donny and I aren't living apart is for him to move down here for a while, but he would have to give up his flat, which would give us a route into Montrose, also if he moves in here, will John get stroppy and stop paying the mortgage, I don't know.  I feel like hiding away until it's all settled.  It's all too much for me to handle on my own.  One thing for sure is that Donny and I will get through this by hook or by crook.  I just need to have faith in the future.   "
26798,3482303,"15,June,2004",2004-06-15,"    I used to cry myself to sleep at night but that was all before he came I thought love had to hurt to turn out right but now he's here it's not the same, it's not the same  He fills me up, he gives me love more love than I've ever seen He's all I've got, he's all i've got in this world But he's all the man that I need  And in the morning when I kiss his eyes he takes me down and rocks me slow And in the evening when the moon is high he hold me close and won't let go, he won't let go  He fills me up, he gives me love more love than i've ever seen He's all I've got, he's all i've got in this world But he's all the man, all the man that I need   "
26799,3482303,"15,June,2004",2004-06-15,"    Over the past few months, Donny and I have spent all our time together, but last night he went home and I won't see him for two weeks.  Last night was hard, watching him go, knowing that he will be 150 miles away, and longing for him to stay with me.  Today I feel lonely, the girls are at school then away with their dad till this evening and I don't know what to do with myself, I feel a wee bit lost.  The only strength I get is that I know I am loved by Donny and the girls, and though we are apart, they live with me all the time in my heart.    Life is good just now, after the trauma of a marriage break up and all that went with it, Donny came just at the right time to shower me with love and devotion.  We have had our problems too, but there is nothing going to stand in the way of true love.  I love Donny so much and I can see a wonderful life ahead, only we have a few obstacles to get over first, like waiting to sell this flat and us having to live apart till then, which is getting harder all the time.  Moving to Montrose will be the best thing for all of us.  I know the kid's will miss friends and their dad will be in Glasgow, but contact will remain and they will have a much better life there, with Donny and I giving them the best we can.  I need to stay strong for Donny, he will only worry if I start to fall to bits without him, but he is my strength, my happiness, my everything, he protects me from all that hurts and loves me so perfectly.  I don't know what I did to deserve him, but it must have been good!    Off now to find something to do, might even go for a nap to pass the time.  Will blog again tomorrow.   "
2529,3483901,"28,June,2004",2004-06-28,"   Like my PG rated title? Never know when a 13 year old my stumble across my blog. Little fuckers. Oops. Um....anyway, nothing much has happened lately. My life is very uneventful, which is sad since I live in Las Vegas. I do see some very interesting things here. Things you would never see in Colorado. Like the following: 1.A dancing Santa on the corner of major intersection. 2.A Walgreen's shopping cart right outside my door (my future home) 3.Being able to hire a Mexican to wash my car at the do-it-yourself carwash (they don't have drive thru car washes here, crazy stuff). 4.A cracked out, hitch-hiking couple screaming at each other on the side of the road. 5.A homeless man with a ""Why lie? I need a beer"" sign on the same corner everyday. (I always give him money) 6.A homeless man in a wheelchair on the opposite corner of the beer man with some sign asking for money (I never give him any)  There are others, but I'm too lazy to think what they are.  God, I have no motivation to do this right now. I'm only doing to amuse Carissa. However, I'm putting myself to sleep right now, so I don't think I could amuse anyway at the moment. I have to go to Hell (also known as work) here in awhile and I'm dreading every second of it. I work with a bunch of fire-breathing retards and because of that, I'm on the verge of insanity. Don't be surprised if my next blog is written inside a jailcell. Do they get computers in jail? Probably. I bet they have nice Sony Vaio laptops. Fuckers.  A friend of a friend gave me a kitten a few days ago. I named him Jagermeister. All he does is eat, sleep, meow, and bite at my philanges. Philanges are toes and fingers right? Correct me if I'm wrong.  I really need money for school. If I was still a virgin, I would sell my virginity on Ebay. Didn't someone do that? Uh, yeah....I'm gonna go now. My hair is wet and the AC is on, so I'm starting to feel like an ice-haired medusa. Adios ya'll.   "
2530,3483901,"13,June,2004",2004-06-13,"   For the past 96 hours I have been in Phoenix visiting my parents (I actually had to get a calculator out to figure that out-so much for college). I love seeing them and all, but damn am I bored. I think it's because I am stuck here and I don't have the choice of being social. From what I hear Phoenix is a happening place. Actually I didn't hear that, I've just seen too many Elima-date episodes. Anyway, I flew so I don't have a vehicle. I could borrow my moms, but where would I go? I would probably end up at a bar, but I couldn't drink because I would have to drive home. Drinking and driving in my mom's Accord definetely don't mix (I would be disowned). So I'd go to a bar, have a glass of water (maybe tea if I'm feeling frisky), probably get hit on by some dirty homeless man, go to the bathroom, vomit, and proceed to go home. Sounds fun, let me find her keys.  I shouldn't bitch. My mom has done more than enough to entertain me. Pedicures, massages, facials, nice dinners, aloe vera for my wicked-one sided sunburn, and plenty of coffee. I appreciate it all, but I can only spend so many nights on the internet before I go crazy. What the hell am I talking about? I remember countless nights of staying up until 4am talking to god knows who. And I loved it. I wonder what happened? Let's see:(1)My computer gets shittier and shittier by the day (2)I turned 21 (3)I slowly lost touch with all my fellow internet geeks (4)I met a boy, fell in love, and moved in with him. I think that last one is the kicker. It's amazing what having a boyfriend will do to you, but that's a whole other story.  At least my parents have the fast internet connection. On my computer I can view maybe 10 websites, then the beast freezes up on me and I'm forced to kick the shit out of it(note: Compaq's keyboards are the Tuff-Sheds of all keyboards). Because of all this, I have been looking to buy a new computer. I have been approved for a $1500 Dell credit card, I just don't know if I can really afford the additional monthly payments. I'd probably have to spend $30-$40 a month, that means I would have to give up buying 2 t-shirts or about 13 fast food meals a month(hello Mr. Calculator again). I need to go on a diet anyway, so maybe this will be a little incentive.  Holy shit! I have just added up the total amount I have spent on fast food/restaurants since April 12 is $280.67. That's like $30 a day and that doesn't even include what I have paid for in cash. Screw the diet, I need to stop eating that crap to save money. So maybe I'll buy the computer and minimize the eating out. I hate Jack in the Box. I just reminded myself of a series of books I just read: Confessions of a Shopaholic and the two books after that, which I won't waste your time with the names. It's about a girl that has a serious shopping problem and finds ways to justify everything she buys. I feel like I just did that with the computer. I think I have the determination to actually do as I say. I hope so anyway. Actually, I just really want the computer. Maybe I'll get rid of my $30/month water cooler also. Maybe I'll get a second job passing out the hooker ads on the strip like I said I was going to. We shall see.   "
2531,3483901,"11,June,2004",2004-06-11,"   Okay, so since I am bored to death, I decided to try this blog thing. Normally I wouldn't do this, because I hate to write, but I had a stoke of inspiration...from an away message on AIM.  Not that anyone cares (I know I don't) and maybe I'm just totally out of date, but it seems that the word of the year is Couture. I don't know what the hell it means, but I have an idea that it deals with fashion. I think this because I've heard/seen it from two fashion-y people: Ashley (where I got my inspiration) and from that ""everything on me has been surgically enhanced"" old model biatch from that America's Next Top Model show. Anyway, I could look it up in the dictionary to see what it means, but during the summer I try to stay away from anything educational, so screw that.  Damnit, I forgot what the whole point of my point is. I need to lay off the wine. Um..........let me think. I hate myself right now for ever trying pot. It's true kids--marijuana effects the memory. My mom told me today that she thinks they should legalize all drugs, damn hippie. Just kidding, she's too young to be a hippie. I just realized that maybe its not the pot, maybe I have that adult ADHD. I saw a commercial about it and it just seemed to call to me. I bet thats how Ashley and face-lift lady feels when they talk about couture.  Aha!!!!Attention all potheads:::::Are you trying to remember something but can't because you smoke too much? Well, I have discovered the remedy:year old Carlo Rossi wine!!! I took a sip and instantly remembered the whole point of my point. Actually, this probably will only work for me because my point involved alcohol. Here goes....  So, why do I care what couture is? Well, as easy-going and non-shallow I try to be, deep down I am a money hungry bitch. Why the hell should I care what couture is? I know I'm not it (or dress like it?), but I'm curious because it sounds expensive. This goes along with other things in my life, like: I want a Louis Vuitton bag, not because I think they are cute, but because they're the thing to have; I always say that someday I'll own designer clothes, even though now I cringe at buying a $15 Roxy tank top; I want an Escalade, even though it is a gas-guzzling POS; I want to learn how to golf, even though in junior high we had a golfing unit and I always hit the ball backwards; and last but not least, I want to start hanging out at martini bars.   What's wrong with that, you may ask. Well, I hate any and all martinis. I hate gin. It reminds me of a party I went to when I lived in Steamboat Springs. There was nothing but a keg and a bottle of gin in the house. I was desperate to get drunk (a true sign of alcoholism) and I hate beer, so I bust out the gin. There was nothing to chase it with, so I poured some in this little toothpick holder that was shaped like a boot, bit the two ends off a Twizzler, put it in my boot and started drinking the gin through the twizzler. It tasted like pure ass. Needless to say, I got hammered and I think I ended up hooking up with some dirty dude with the nickname of Sloth (like from The Goonies). I'm going to go throw up now.  So now that I have resurfaced some horrible memories, I leave on this note: I am a rich, bitch stuck in a poor girls body. Maybe some day I'll have all those materialitic things, but I'll also have my white-trash past to beat me back into reality.   It is time for a refill....   "
2532,3483901,"30,July,2004",2004-07-30,"   Summer is almost over and it's very depressing. I'm not looking forward to spending all my time off from work at school again. I'm really enjoy my lazy days off. Last night, I stayed up until 5:30am reading a book, then I woke up at 8, went to work for 1/2 an hour, came back home and passed out until about 2:30. It was great. I could spend my life doing that. Then I would get way fat. I need to go work out. Carissa, you need to come out here and make me motivated. You're all I have (tear!). I'm just kidding. Also, you need to call me whore. I've been trying to call for a couple of weeks now.  Anyway, it's a day later now. It' s hard for me to focus on this damn thing. Like right now, I just woke up from a nice little nap, but I'm still all exhausted and all I want to do is sleep. My dumb blood sugar has been really low now for a few days and its not getting better. I basically feel nervous, and every once in awhile I feel the urge to puke and then I can't breath very well and then I feel like I'm gonna faint. I know I need to eat, but just looking at food makes me want to hurl. Maybe I'm really just becoming anorexic and its all subconsious. Nah, I couldn't live without my chesseburgers (hurl now). Maybe all that eating has officially turned me diabetic. God, that would really suck.  Boo.....so Jess has been gone all week and I'm sad to say, it has been nice. Hopefully he'll never see this, but I'm really thinking its time we take a little break. We've had a really good run, but I don't think either one of us is ready for the relation ship we have. I just don't want to break up with him because I know I would regret it for the rest of my life. He's so good to me, but of course my dumbass has to ruin everything. We'll see. We have one more month of living together, maybe things will get better.  Happier topic, the Devil (also know as my district manager) is stepping down from her position. Thank you Jesus! That woman is seriously the worst person I have ever met and I really wouldn't be all that upset if she got stranded on some deserted island (with plenty of food and water of course). I'm hoping that work won't suck so bad now. Finding a new job is not easy. I'm smart and semi-educated, but no one likes to hire college kids. Apparently, working around a school schedule is a really difficult task. Well potential employers, you can all fuck off because someday, I'll show you all. When I have my own super bank, I won't let you open an account with me. That'll show them. Yeah right.  So I have some eye candy at work finally. I would never date one of my employees or anything, but this guy in unbelievable. Totally Jamie. He's got spikey hair, gauged ears, and a labret piercing (which normally I don't like, but he looks good in it). He's a little odd, but fun to talk to. At least he could make work a little more interesting, nothing wrong with that. It will be like in high school. Most of the time, my only motivation to get out of bed and actually go to school was to see whoever I was pursuing at the time. It's like a reason to do my hair in the morning. That's horrible that I say this, it should be my boyfriend that gets me up in the morning, but no, it's not. I think that might be a good sign it's over. That and I was almost tempted to meet a guy I have been talking to on the internet for awhile. He was totally cool and I actually saw like a friendship developing, but I pissed him off (I'm good at that) and he doesn't want to talk to me anymore. Oh well, life goes on. I'm super cold, so I'm gonna go. Bya.   "
2533,3483901,"28,July,2004",2004-07-28,"   Ugh....I'm never drinking again. Last night I went to this club called the Beach. It's kinda shitty, but ladies get in free and drink free until 11, so I was stoked. Anyway, we got there at 10, so I had one hour to drink as many free drinks as I could. I ended up chugging four, then later had a couple shots. One of the shots was from those hot guys that walk around all buff like with a bottle of some sort of tasty poison(Ashley would uh, for lack of a better term, cream her pants). I had to get on my knees and he made me touch his ass. I felt like a white trash, 30 year old that couldn't get any action. I don't know why exactly, but the whole experience was traumatizing. Anyway, we danced for a few hours and my ass was still furshnickered when it was time to leave, so Karen took me home and let me pass out on her couch. The next morning I woke up and had no idea where I was for a few seconds. I must say, that is a pretty scary feeling.  So it wasn't a very exciting night, however I did have to suffer through the day with a really nasty hangover. It's 1 in the morning and I still feel like poo poo. We're supposed to try this new club at treasure island tomorrow, but my ass is dirt poor and I'm not sure if I'm ready to drink like that again. I guess I could play sober, but where is the fun in that? Sniff, sniff....i smell weed. My roommate must be home, maybe I'll go play. Nah, I'd rather hole up in my room and not be social right now. I think it's actually my bedtime. I keep looking at the book I'm reading and it's&nbsp;way more appealling than this blog. So live long and prosper (or something). Nighty night night.   "
2534,3483901,"22,July,2004",2004-07-22,"   I am such a loser. Everyone is at Gabe's tonight playing pool and drinking and stuff, but because I'm wore out from work and I have to be back there at 8 in the morning, I stayed at home and got on the internet. Which isn't too bad. I am experimenting with my new computer&nbsp; (yea!!!!). Either way, getting old sucks ass.   Yesterday was Jamie gets cool stuff day. I got my computer and my camera in the mail and Jess finally got a security system and my CD player put in my car. I felt rich for like 2 hours yesterday. Then I looked at my checkbook and saw the whopping $25 in there and that forced me back into reality. Hmm...I'm gonna be a nerd and upload some pictures of my kitty. If I can figure out how.   Ugh...nevermind. You have to download some program and I don't feel like doing that right now. I'm gonna save this and go eat. I shall return soon....   ...2 Days Later  So much for returning soon. Jess just left for Colorado for a week. This is gonna be the first time he's left me alone for more than a few days in a long time. We'll see how that goes. I'm gonna party it up man. It will be like being single, but not really. Like I can go dancing and not have to come home feeling guilty just because I danced with some dude in a drunken stupor. I can be freeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee.   Hey Ashley, I need to get your your blog site again. My dumbass forgot it again. Thanks.   Random though, yes. I hate my butt. I don't care how many black guys like it (and white guys too apparently), but having a ghetto ass is nothing but trouble. Seriously, like everyday at work, the subject of my ass comes up in some sort of way at least twice. My boss (who is black) might say something about me looking like a ""sista"" or my sales associate's roommate who says he would like to work at my store so he can watch my ""rump-a dump"" (or something) all day and the worst: my sales associate's boyfriend who wants me to come to their hottub so he can see my ass naked (sick!). I can't walk through the mall with some sort of dirty remark. ""Damn shorty, what are they feeding you?"" ""Pssshhhh girl, are you mix?"" ""Mumble mumble girl mumble mumble mumble ass."" Or my ever favorite:""Jamie, do you like chicken?""   The very worst part about it is buying jeans. I can't even explaing the issues I have. I am 4'11'' with a size nine ass and a size five waist. So when I buy my jeans, I have to buy a size nine. That means the waist is going to stick out like 3 inches in the back. Hello ass crack!!!! Even if I put a belt on, I can't catch a break. The waist gets all bunched together and plops out from under the belt. There are pants called Applebottle jeans by Nelly that are made for girls with big asses and little wasits. I checked them out and they weren't too bad. However, I don't mean to stereotype, but they look like jeans that black girls wear. I would like a tool wearing most of them. When I went into the store that carries them, the black girl at the counter looked at me all funny, then looked down to my ass, nodded and went back to watching the news (they have TV in their store, I'm jealous). Either way, they are like $80 a pair. I'm too poor for that shiat. I'll just let my crack hang out.   I saw another crazy person in Las Vegas today. We were all driving to Subway and as we were leaving our complex, there was this old lady with a shopping cart crossing the apartment exit. We decided to wait for her thinking that she was almost done crossing. Soon enough, we realized the lady was just inching along VERY slowly. It took her at least a minute just to cross the exit. As she was passing by our car, I could tell she was probably in her fifities. She was so skinny that she looked like one of those starving Ethiopian babies and her skin was burnt to a crisp. AJ said it best: ""She looks like the fucken cryptkeeper."" It was quite entertaining.   So that's all for now. I'm sure I'll be back ""soon""   "
2535,3483901,"20,July,2004",2004-07-20,"   Dumby dum...burp! Nothing new lately, surprise surprise! Work is shitty and hot. The damn AC has been broken, so I've been sweating up&nbsp; a storm. I'm gonna have to start putting deoderant on my entire body just so I don't offend. Hmm....last weekend, Matt and Shanna came from Colorado to visit for a day or so and we all went to the strip to ride the monorail. I parked my car at the&nbsp;MGM, planning on taking the monorail to the Sahara, then walking to the Stratosphere, then taking the monorail to Imperial Palace, grabbing a yard margarita, and then walking back to the MGM. We each bought two train passes (back and forth) and started our journey.   We did the Statosphere thing and got back to the monorail station at 11:40 pm, just in time for a security guard to tell us that the last train had left because the place shut down at midnight. At first I thought he was kidding, but no, he wasn't. We were all pretty broke, so we couldn't take a taxi. The busses are nasty as all hell, so were forced to walk. It was late at night and we were in the ghetto. It was hot and I had been on my feet all day. So basically, we were completely miserable the entire 3 mile walk home.&nbsp; F-ing monorail.  However, some interesting things did happen. I found a cool little liquor store that had unique gift baskets. A crackhead lasy told me I looked like I was on meth because of my eyes. ""You look like you're in the Twilight Zone,"" says crackwhore. She then preceeded to ask Jess if he had papers and showed him a huge bud of pot wrapped up in a towel. There was another crackhead screaming at himself and a drunk man that tripped over the curb.   I'm sooooo bored. My computer is supposed to come today, I just hope it comes soon. It will give me something to do. In the meantime, I'm going to go play Simpson's Road Rage. That game is the shiat.   "
2536,3483901,"13,July,2004",2004-07-13,"   I am the laziest POS that I know. For the past three days I have holed up in my room playing Super Nintendo and shopping for a computer on the internet (I finally found one, it comes Tuesday!). I guess I did go to the strip yesterday. Jess and I went to Cheeseburger Oasis in the Aladdin(i think thats what it is called). Anyway, we each had a drink there and then we walked down to some ghetto hotel with those huge margaritas. We each got one and walked around Caeser's Palace. We were both wasted by the time we got home. We passed out, Jess puked like always, and later that night I was hungover. It was weird.  Hmmm, I get a free digital camera with my new computer. It'll probably be cheap and shitty, but who cares, at least I'll have one. I can take pictures of my super exciting life and post them for the world to see. I'll spice it up by throwing some S&M pictures in there (eww-what?).  Moving on. I've decided that when I become rich, I'm going to give out a scholarship to middle-class, average, white girls and whoever writes the worst essay wins the most money. I hate the fact that because I to write, I can't get any scholarships. The system sucks. Damn the man! Save the empire!    m     d  I need something to do. I'm gonna look for a job. Peace out.   "
2537,3483901,"08,July,2004",2004-07-08,"   Today is a half day and I'm excited. I don't have to go to work until 6pm. Granted, I would much rather never have to go, but a 4 hour shift is nothing compared to an 8 hour shift. Woo hoo. So my 4th of July was very interesting. I had my BBQ. It was fairly uneventful, except my future roommates new man got all psycho about his theory on why people do drugs. He thinks that people try drugs because they are lost and/or depressed. Fuck no, they try it because of peer pressure (cough cough Carissa-brings back good times in the smelly Pontiac). Whatever.   Anyway, after lighting some fireworks, we headed off to this bar called The Whiskey. It was the nicest bar I've been to. The inside was like a typcial fancy smancy bar, but the outside was the coolest. There were beds and couches to sit on and some of the beds even had a little TV built into them. Most of the outside area was surrounded by one of those eternity pools. I had to wonder if any drunkass had ever fallen in. It was free to get in, but the drinks started at $6 a piece. Ouch.  So not long after we got there, Jess claimed that he wasn't drunk enough, so he went to get a double shot of 151. He was beligerant just a few minutes later. He started wandering around, bumping into things. Then he got angry and said I was the worst girlfriend ever and that I'm always cheating on him. I just laughed it off because I knew he was drunk and talking nonsense. I was having a good old time with everyone else there, when all the sudden...dun, dun, dunnn....Jess blows chunks all over the sidewalk in front of everyone. It wasn't even a minute before security was surrounding us giving us the go home evil eye. So we packed our bags and dragged Jess's drunk ass out of there (which wasn't easy, the bar was inside of a huge casino).  I learned my lesson: never take my underage boyfriend to a nice bar until he learns to moderate his drinking. I would have to say this was the worst 4th of July ever. I'll get over it.  I need to eat and I have some coffee on the pot needing to be drank (I bet your jealous now, eh Carissa?) Peace out ya'll.   "
2538,3483901,"04,July,2004",2004-07-04,"   My cat is trying to kill me. My arm, my eye, and everywhere else on my body has been sliced to all hell. I'm just one big, walking scab right now. It's sick. I forgot how much fun it was to have a kitten. He keeps trying to eat my pizza too. No way fucker, it's mine! I can't wait until the little shit gets declawed. My life will be complete again.  Today is a sad day. Instead of primping myself for a night of hardcore partying at Ashley's, I'm trying to get motivation to clean my house for a little BBQ I'm having tonight. Fuck cleaning, I want to fly out to Colorado. I wonder how much tickets are? Anyway, back to reality. After the food tonight, I'm going to the Whiskey Bar in Henderson (I think that's what it is called). I hear it's nice, but drinks are expensive. I'm gonna have to wear something skanky so I can get some free drinks. Oh wait, I think Jess is coming. Screw that idea. Owwwww....cat just bit my toe. I'm going to go do my dishes right now. Maybe I'll think of something else to write while I do that.   Nope, nothing. I did find a giant cockroach though. I hate the damn things. They are huge and they refuse to die. You can step on one and they won't have a scratch. Rumor has it that if you chop of their head, they won't die. Thats some shit isn't it? Ugh...well I have cleaning to do and showers to take. Peace out ya'll.   "
4357,3487773,"29,May,2004",2004-05-29,    HMm...just testing this out...gonna have to figure how to link this to my page...erm....   
4358,3487773,"19,June,2004",2004-06-19,"    Hey BVC ppl...  Have u guys thought about ordering ur gowns for Call? I cant seem to find my list of things i need to order. Just want to see how much it will cost. I tried to go to www.gownhire.co.uk, but after clicking Gray's Inn, the page is invalid! So how in the world are we gonna hire our stuff?  Oh...and how do i change my fonts? I dont like this one... hmm...will go find out... BRB..   "
4359,3487773,"17,June,2004",2004-06-17,"    We all can breathe a sigh of relief by tomorrow. Final papers are due and its over!  Its been a very stressful, strenuous, taxing and challenging year for everyone on the BVC. This has been the most challenging course Iâ€™ve undertaken and Iâ€™m quite happy its finally over.  However, having said that, it was also one of the most enjoyable course Iâ€™ve taken. (aside from French)  Iâ€™ve been pushed to do things and not slack throughout the year. Its true what the lecturers told us in the beginning, that this is going to take over our lives for the next 9 months.  Iâ€™ve had little time for anything else; friends, social life, etc. I found myself coming home from classes and studying or starting on the next subjectâ€™s homework. Iâ€™ve literally turned into a Nerd! And you know what? Its not that difficult to put a little more effort into what we have to do. After all, what is 9 months compared to your whole life?  I must admit, its never been smooth sailing the whole way. I may look ok on the outside, but inside, I am a wreck! Iâ€™ve had a few nervous breakdowns this year alone!  Maybe it was tougher this year coz Iâ€™ve always been â€˜spoon fedâ€™ all my life and now I have to do it all on my own. Donâ€™t ask me how I got my law degree, coz I have no idea what I was doingâ€¦ Ok, this is not gonna be too good on my CV!  Some people say that I must be smart to come all this way in something I donâ€™t like. But I think its â€˜guiltâ€™ that really drives me. I feel I owe my parents something for spending so much money on my education and I should be grateful, for not everyone is as lucky as I am. They want me to be successful and live comfortably in the future and I donâ€™t see anything wrong with that.  Studies aside, what I really enjoyed this year is meeting friends that Iâ€™ve made throughout the year. I feel very lucky to have these people as my friends, just as I thought Iâ€™d never find good friends that easily. I know this is very clichÃ©, but I really thank God Iâ€™ve found them. And I am so grateful to those who have been by my side when I needed them most.  Its not been an easy year for me, emotionally. But I always could talk to someone about my problems and whatever happens, I know theyâ€™ll always be there for me and never let me feel alone.  I am really going to miss them all when I leave.  Some of my friends have left already and although I donâ€™t feel it yet, but its gonna hit me in a few weeks. But Iâ€™ve always been optimistic about life, and I know somehow, someday Iâ€™ll see them again.  We might not grow old together, but Iâ€™ll always know thereâ€™s someone out there I can count on, and they on me.  I am really looking forward to going home to Penang. I miss the lifestyle and food, But it will be very difficult to fit in again. Iâ€™ve lost contact with a lot of my friends back home, but I know that I will be fine.  I never really believed people who tell me that University life is the best. But now, I CONCUR!  Iâ€™m just feeling all melancholie now. I want to go back, but I donâ€™t want to leave my friends. I realise that I donâ€™t have to have 1000 friends, just a handful that really matter to me.  I just want to give a shoutout to my dear friends that Iâ€™ve met here and will miss a lot when we all part.  Madelene Tan(Iâ€™ll c u back home, right?)

Ciao!   "
4360,3487773,"16,June,2004",2004-06-16,"    Have you LOVED before?  If to love means to be selfless, then I have not loved before, For I have always been selfish.  And why shouldnâ€™t I?  Maybe I have never loved anyone then. Maybe I want to be loved and when this is not given to me, I feel the need to somehow extract love from the people I think I love. But I realise that I have not loved, but need to be loved.  Affection. I have given so much and still have so much to give. One never exhausts affection. I find it so hard to withhold affection to the ones I care for.  Maybe thatâ€™s why I love to shower my loved ones with gifts. Not just the various partners I have had, but even my close friends. Whenever I see something that I think they might like, I feel like getting it for them. No matter the cost, for I am satisfied if they are happy.  But is it really necessary to give gifts?  Maybe Iâ€™m too materialistic. Tell me that to my face. I have no qualms. For I know it is true. Material things do make me happy. But Love?  My heart has been broken too many times to know what LOVE is anymore.  WHAT IS LOVE? Is it an emotion of giving but not expecting anything in return? Is it a warm feeling for another person? Is it a feeling of security? Or is it just plain physical?  Relationships puzzle me. Why would a guy want to spend time with a girl? And for that matter, what does a girl want from a guy? Other than to procreate, I donâ€™t really understand what couples really need from each other. Attention, care, affection, emotional support? Any human being is capable of providing that. Maybe more females than males. Maybe thatâ€™s why more females turn to their own kind.  Iâ€™m not saying that I am homosexual. I just donâ€™t really understand a heterosexual relationship anymore.  Attraction And why is it that Iâ€™m always attracted by guys who break my heart? Maybe its because I pick the â€˜wrongâ€™ kind of guys. Iâ€™ve always been attracted to the rebellious ones, the bad boy look, etc. I never seem to be attracted to the nice â€˜rightâ€™ ones.  The ones that would listen to me, talk to me and hold me like I want to be held.  Maybe they do. Maybe I just expect too much in a relationship. Does that mean Iâ€™ll never be happy? Should I lower my expectations? Will I be happy then? I doubt it. I need too much. Would anyone ever understand?  Am I overly sensitive? I think I feel emotions more than a lot of people. I used to be aloft and blissfully unaware of other peopleâ€™s feelings when I was younger. But now, everything I do seems to reflect how I think people will feel. Iâ€™m not impulsive anymore and take an awful lot of care before I open my mouth.  Have you ever felt, when watching a movie, that you wanna shake a character to just say what they have inside? For example, a girl/guy who wants to confess their love/emotions for another and is holding back for various reasons? Iâ€™ve always wanted to just shout â€œJust say it!â€ But now, I find myself holding back. Biting my tongue, suffering in silence.  A friend once said â€œHe who sighs never gets what he wantsâ€. It could be true. It so frustrating!  You want to let them know how you feel, but you think about the consequences. Is it worth it? Whatâ€™s gonna change? And then thereâ€™s regret.  I used to say â€œI donâ€™t have any regrets yet!â€ I used to think that everything Iâ€™ve done made me who I am today. But who am I today, really? Do I have regrets? Definitely!  Of course weâ€™ve all made mistakes in life. What would life be without mistakes? What would we learn without them? But it doesnâ€™t prevent us from regretting, being sad, being hurt.  Câ€™est La Vie!  I just want someone to love me as much as I love him. Is that too much to ask?   "
4361,3487773,"11,June,2004",2004-06-11,"    Last night we (BVC STUDENTS) had a BVC dinner at the Royal West of England Academy and it was pretty boring. Maybe coz it was too bright in the dining hall, or maybe it was coz we had to sit and talk to people we dont normally have conversations with. I was also having a headache, so that didnt help...  Was separated from my friends and so was pretty lonely...  Took LOTS and LOTS of pics with all my dear friends, and cant wait to develop them...i have another roll, with the Birthday BBQ pics to develop as well! oh man, looks like i'm gonna be eating grass soon!  After the dinner, we all headed to Fuschia for a party and was admitted into the VIP room, which we didnt even spend much time in anyway! But thanks to T(hiru) who organised it, we had fun! at least i did! I was given a Tequila shot to down and i DID! but 1/2 hr later i was totally out of it...dunno if i was drunk or what, but i had a massive headache and it felt so heavy...and my vision was turning black! maybe i was gonna pass out and had to sit down every few steps! but once i got outside, i felt loads better...got home safely, thanks to Jenny, Maddy and Ian and plonked into bed, after taking everything off!  Woke up at about 12.30pm, so no going to class for me! hehe it started at 11am! but had to come in to pick up my International Trade brief anyway... should have brought my IT notes, so i could do my work here..coz i dont have internet so i always have to come into Uni to do my online research. sheesh! what a hassle.  well, better stop talking and start cracking on.  I cant wait till the 18th! then i'll be FREE!!!   "

I'll also be called to the BAR at Gray's Inn on the 22nd July.  Shipped like 4 boxes home to Penang and had to wait like forever for that fella to come pick it up..from 7pm-1am!! and he finally came at 10am the next day!! stupid shit!!  Ok, so now my room looks like it was hit by a tornardo..and being me, i.e. lazy as hell, i am not bothered to clean it up.. and no one can make me...HAH!  anyway...i booked like my barrister's gown and bands and still dont know what shirt i am suppose to wear with the bands...  booked my coach to london, hotel and hopefully everything goes smoothly.  If i knew i had to ship my things by last friday, then i would have gotten the eurostar back to Paris with Julz from London on 25th!! sheesh...talk about bad planning...but how was i to know that the shippers were so unflexible? can only pick up on friday and no other day for Bristol!! sheesh...what kind of business is this? who's the client here?  so now i have to come back to bristol on 25th and leave for Paris via London on the 28th!  but luckily the flight is not that expensive... only Â£27.99 with easyjet. eurostar was Â£50!  But its good that i can come back to have a farewell dinner with my friends before i leave UK, for good (maybe).  will certainly miss my friends, but never the weather!! HAH! i cannot understand how ppl can still live here! and dont get me started on the lifestyle! *rolling eyes!*  ok lah, better go now, coz i am very very hungry and shih's blog about malaysian food does not really help hungry ppl in UK!! :P  ciao!

Men hmm hvorn kan folk vide at den person de vil overraske bliver glad? Er det ik bare som et lille plaster pÃ¥ sÃ¥ret, fordi man tilfÃ¦ldigvis har vÃ¦ret en rÃ¸v, sq vi sige i smÃ¥ 6 mdr. Godt sÃ¥! Well bout last night, went out with the fabulous 3, even though there is only 2 left... Was supposed to do history with Ãsi, we hurried through that and had a nice barbecue and drank some wine instead. Paw joined us. Well after the barbe joey came over and we had a few drinks,and therefore decided to go out :) This was of course after joey was properly down on his knees... to put a ring on the finger of course! ;) yesh yesh properly engaged, vegas here we come!  Well town was fun as usual, drinks, dancing, and a wicked game of DIE, right Ã si!?! (for those who are lost, one dice two die) :P met some weird ppl @ cosy... bit creepy when u are too sober, must keep in mind- note to self!  Evening ended with joey dragging me home waaaaay too late, and when got of bus, realized that keys to house was in car, which was neatly parked @ Ã¡si's... so after a little detour i came home without falling over too much... all in all a successful day...  Nu skal der bare gÃ¸res rent, er alene hjemme Dee er ude og hente lunse i lufthavnen... yesh der trÃ¦nger vist os til det...  Nogen der kommer og hjÃ¦lper?   "

25003,3494693,"04,June,2004",2004-06-04,"    Wedn Night.  Well were sitting quietly with Dee watching BS tv when a panicing Mie called. ""Are you alright?!?!?"" Yes I lived even though I live in the Bronx and 2 ppl just got shot 2min from my flat. Damn had a minor panick attack myself, whats wrong with the world?? New B tried comforting making fun of me, think it was the whole idea that it was my turn next... The two bastards who did it is still at lose- Yes, guess where they dumeped their get-away-car?!?! yep, thats right next to my street. How totally fucked is that?!?! Well still no prospect of actually meeting New B yet, he's still busy with his store... When I finally got to bed I couldnt sleep... Note to self- you live on 4th floor, what are the odds someone will come in your sleep, rape, murder and what-not to ya?? - Stop worrying FFS!     Thursday  Celebrations have set in... yey at me for getting old :) Had a group meeting in the morning, was of course v. late... Quite an accomplishment turning of ur alarm in ur sleep so it doesnt go off :( After group meeting Yndi Guggu and I went for a bagel and laid in a nice parc tanning, and discussing all sorts of things... fabulous sunshine-- And am actually getting brownish ;) Talked to Christian when got home and decided that we should have a little date, so he rushed over round 8pm so we could watch Paradise Hotel.. or something! Well turned out to be a loooooong nice evening... you get my drift ;) Drank some wine, ended doing v. crazy things... (trust me its not to know...) But will tell that I helle 4yrs old dared him to do push-ups... 14 way to go sweets- Taking into consideration you had been using your stamina for other more important things ;) Of course I couldn't be a sissy, so had to prove that was nothing, ended up doing... hmmm too many! Well after 5-6 hours of fun it was time to sleep... and Christian decided to be a gentleman and move my wine-covered table... yesh i managed to knock over a bottle of wine, 2 FULL wine glasses and god knows what... my carpet is still red.. smooooth as usual, i am!! :) ...Anywho, so while he moves this table, he sorta loses his balance, and the show he put on there was the funniest thing I ever seen! He steps on bed, almost falls over, so step up on couch, turn around still no balance at all and table with stuff on his hands, manage to finally get down on floor and put table down. Take a bow sweetie, nothing fell off table and he didnt fall over...  Spooned and snuggled all night- except for when i woke up from PAIN in my arms... grrr never doing push-ups again--- 4 asprins and 10 hous later, it still hurts!!!! Damn it!   How stupid can u be? And who said exercise was     good for you!!   "

We all have got mobiles, mine is clinincly attached to me. v. fine in situations when you actually need it, or when you have not substituted all reason with a taaaad bit of beer...   So making a long story a bit shorter... The day started with a trip to RUC... evaluation of the semester. Yes we do actually work at out there once in a while, picked up our pretty, wonderful, and absolutely fab project! Well done girlies!! Think we managed to twist our way out of doing the BS history notes... dan charlie, dan charlie what _were_ you thinking?!?  The previous-mentioned surprise, had absolute dickely duckely nothing to do with me, but congratz on the new toy Mus! Be careful and dont break ur neck ;)Guess i might get a sneak peak today...  Talked with sweet Chris, it was nice he's on his way to becoming famous, cant wait to see the film ;) Nor can i wait until he move his pretty little behind over here!   Had peachy dinner with Dee, and then got ready to meet Joey-- So got to studenterhuset and had several beers... Joey and I were talking bout embarrasing things... And good ol' stories! Went on to cosy... And by then I had started SMS'ing ""things"" to B.. (the potential new)... ohhh dear, somebody plz shoot me! Should really not say things like that to someone who doesnt know you... imagine the worst u can say x5 then you have what I told him ;/ Well it gets worse... have never talked to this guy, phone acts up... so i decide through my beer goggles that the most rational would be to call him. 2am, am in the middle of a noisy gay bar, and cant even get two words straight (okay not to get things straight in a gaybar) but this was calling New B. Well the first words are kinda like: ssshellow shhhow are uuuuuu doing... where to he replies: you are drunk!   Well partied on til Joey v. casually draaagged me home... ;) thanx hubby u r a doll :D Have woken up feeling semi quasi okay, have group meeting in the city...  Walk out in a g-string thing making coffee... standing there in my own pretty little world... ass on full display... Old friend Rasmus from Gymnasium walks out off dee's room, and greets morning... how to begin the day :/ Top dollar class!  Does anyone have an asprin?   "

Og over en frokost lagde vi sÃ¥ en kampplan! Det skulle vÃ¦re en gave der indholdt alle af fÃ¸lgende elementer: Nyttig, betÃ¦nksom, god, ikke for stor, skulle os gerne signalere jeg er sÃ¸d, betÃ¦nksom, vÃ¦lg mig og by the way tak for hjÃ¦lpen!      Hvad skal man sÃ¥ kÃ¸be??? Det er selvfÃ¸lgelig meget at en ting skal kunne!

25006,3494693,"09,August,2004",2004-08-09,"    - SÃ¥ er sommeren nÃ¦sten ovre, og thank you God for det!! Denne sommer har vÃ¦ret komplet ubeskrivelig! 'Summer from Hell' i daglig tale-- Alt hvad der kunne gÃ¥ galt er gÃ¥et galt, ja Murphy du har sgu made your point - Crystal Clear!      Men der har da ogsÃ¥ vÃ¦ret positive ting, selvfÃ¸lgelig har der det.... Ã¸hhhh *tÃ¦nke* hmmm tjooo... ja har fundet en bikini ;) Ja, det lyder ik som meget action, men gennegÃ¥r 'find en bikini helvede hver sommer' og hvorfor skulle 2004 vÃ¦re anderledes- SÃ¥ frisk, fro og optimistisk drog jeg ind til den indre by... Det er jo trods alt  bare  en bikini... Det kan jo ik vÃ¦re sÃ¥ svÃ¦rt finde, eller.... Men 2004 var anderledes, denne gang fandt jeg en, og nÃ¦Ã¦Ã¦Ã¦ hvor er den fin! Har ogsÃ¥ allerede vÃ¦ret ude og lufte den pÃ¥ kirkegÃ¥rden- ja har min egen grÃ¸nne plet der!      Ellers ser jeg frem til det 'nye' Ã¥r! Ja, for det er jo sÃ¥dan nÃ¥r man er studerende starter der et nyt Ã¥r her om sommeren selvom kalenderen ik siger det. Men tÃ¦nk jer det gÃ¸r den jo sÃ¥ alligevel, vi har jo vores egen som begynder og slutter i juli! :) 2. Ã¥rs studerende, har allerede fÃ¥et kriller i maven ligesom den allerfÃ¸rste skoledag, ever! Der stod man sÃ¥ 6 Ã¥r, fin ny plyser-rÃ¸d bluse med bamser pÃ¥, sort lille rygsÃ¦k med en koala-bjÃ¸rn pÃ¥. Ja jeg havde en ting for plyssede ting, Ã¸hh har det vist stadig!:) shh! og nu var det bare sÃ¥ spÃ¦ndende havde klatret op pÃ¥ plankevÃ¦rket en million gange for at se pÃ¥ de store bÃ¸rn, der var sÃ¥ heldige at gÃ¥ henne pÃ¥ skolen! (skolen lÃ¥ jo lige henne pÃ¥ den anden side af gaden) Og den varme velkommende fornemmelse man fik da man kom ind i ens fÃ¸rste klasselokale, der var smÃ¥ runde borde, et kÃ¸kken, hyggerum og lege-area. Det var en hel ny verden, alfabetet var hÃ¦ngt op over tavlen sammen med tallene- Sikke en spÃ¦ndende dag! Det minder unÃ¦gtelig meget om RUC, glÃ¦der mig til at komme tilbage til vores hus... kÃ¸kkenet, 'hyggerum' aka grupperum, der er os tavler med info osv... se bÃ¸rnehaveklassen om igen! Ja, til tider virker det ogsÃ¥ som folk stadig skulle starte i bÃ¸rnehaveklassen!    I gÃ¥r fik jeg sÃ¥ en besked fra min onkel, love him to pieces, tÃ¦nker pÃ¥ alt det han har gennemgÃ¥et denne sommer... og pludselig ligner min sommer vand i forhold til! Han sagde at han havde tilbragt dagen med sit livs kÃ¦rlighed, og sÃ¥ var det at det slog mig, at det er ogsÃ¥ det jeg vil. Efter 20 Ã¥rs Ã¦gteskab, vil jeg ogsÃ¥ kunne sidde og nyde en sommerdag og stadig vÃ¦re forelsket! Hvem ved mÃ¥ske dukker prinsen op fÃ¸r eller siden... han gemmer sig bare godt!!! Kom frit frem, jeg bidder ikke---- hÃ¥rdt :P    SÃ¥ det her er for en ny start, nyt Ã¥r, nye venner, nye hobbyer, nyt arbejde, ny kÃ¦reste... ja der er lidt at arbejde pÃ¥, men selvfÃ¸lgelig er nogle af de omrÃ¥der ved at falde pÃ¥ plads! :)    Skulle man starte med sit vasketÃ¸j?!?

21895,3495545,"05,June,2004",2004-06-05,"   In the distant future...  With technology spreading across the internet, information sharing had a sense of value and importance which enabled easy communication. However, there were a number of cases in which there were communication problems. Crimes committed by network hackers began to spread onto a worldwide scale due to the disperse of secret information. Will we be able to keep track of where this is going?  One such case happened on a certain day when the stock prices repeatedly jumped, which lead to depreciation in the New York Stock Exchange. The hacker who was responsible was detected by the server through the transaction, but he has yet to be arrested. The establishment was under the United Nations WNC (The Worldwide Network Council). The danger in the network still continues to increase.  And it happened suddenly... In the year 2005 the main computer that was connected to the network for the entire world, stopped working on December 24th. The communication controls and the other networks connected experienced a network collision in a worldwide scale. After this incident, the network recovered its performance 77 minutes later. The automatic retaliatory system of the United States began to operate erroneously and was dangerously moving to a point of crisis, which was connected to a terrestrial existence. The ""Pluto Kiss"" virus which attacked was created by a mere 10-year-old elementary school student...  Among the few, the ""ALTIMIT"" OS was not affected by the ""Pluto Kiss"" at all. Eventually, the WNC announced that the majority of the network servers of the entire world will switch to the ALTIMIT OS, in 2007, 2 years after the incident.  In addition, the restriction of the network utilization of entertainment system was removed in the same year, December 24th. Simultaneously on the same day, the MMORPG ""The World"" was sold. The United Nations declared the safety of the network and ""The Mother Mary's Kiss"" was named and was known as an international holiday.  And on December 24th of 2007... 0 o'clock and 0 minutes, the worldwide simultaneous download of ""The World"" began. ""The World"" will bring disasterous incidents years later, without anyone realizing it now...  "
21896,3495545,"02,June,2004",2004-06-02,   yaaaawn!!! so sleepy  
24219,3500159,"31,May,2004",2004-05-31,"   Today is Memorial Day and while we attended the requisite party at our good friends Jeff and Kathi's house, I had to think about the deeper meaning of Memorial Day. Although I have always known the true meaning, before now it has just been a day for fun, cooking out, and entertaining.  Now I realize that it is about remembering those who have died both in wars and not.  I spent a lot of the day talking to my neighbor about what a brewmiester my cousin was.  Then a new neighbor arrived.  He has to be in his late 80's and is a WWII veteran.  He ate with us, talked to the kids and even shared a beer with the guys.  I was in awe of him because he is just a neat old man and he had so much fun just talking and watching the kids swim.  He just lost his wife of many years in January and yet here he was still seeking out friendships with his neighbors who are young enough to be his grandchildren. What a cool guy!  And we did have a nice day just relaxing by the pool, eating and watching our kids play.  It is great to have good friends!  "
24220,3500159,"30,May,2004",2004-05-30,"   Well, it was bound to happen, I guess.  Last summer I was told that my cousin had a ""blog""....not quite knowing what that was, I wasn't sure if I should be concerned or not!  After logging on to his blog and seeing what a really cool thing it is, I thought I might one day try it and never gave it another thought. My cousin was a total computer freak.  He knew everything there was to know.  While I like to think I am pretty good, I had no clue how to do this.....  Life gets to us sometimes, you know?  We all get busy and times just flies by and of course, I never did get around to trying to figure out how to be a ""blogger"".   Now we fast forward to April of this year when this same dear cousin of mine suddenly passed away at age 35.  Now I was forced to stop and think about some things. I realized  that life is just way too short.  And, yes, I had read his blog, but had I called my cousin?  Had I sent a card or an e-mail?  No....and now I can't. And yet, even with that kind of wake up call I find myself still being too busy to stay in close contact with those who are the most important to me.  I vow to do better.  Not a day has passed since that April morning when we lost my cousin that I have not cried for him, his little girl, his wife and his parents and brother.  Our family will never be the same again.  But I do know that we must take time to connect with others, even though we are too busy and life is crazy most of the time.  Because, I have sadly learned, when they are gone, it is too late. So, for you Jeremy, I too, will be a blogger!  "
24221,3500159,"17,June,2004",2004-06-17,"   Well, we survived our vacation.  It was cold and rained a lot but still beats the heat of Texas in June.  Spending time with 35 relatives is quite an undertaking....and then there are those who come home with you for another week!    Got a call today that my dear friend lost her baby boy at 22 weeks gestation.  How can that be fair when that baby was wanted so much?   It is hard to understand sometimes.  The summer is passing quickly.....maybe we can get some things accomplished before school starts back up.... Why is it time goes so fast when you need it to go slowly????  "
24222,3500159,"04,June,2004",2004-06-04,"   We are officially on a much needed vacation.  It is so cold here and only going to get colder.  We are in northern Wisconsin and from Fort Worth, Texas, it is a world away.  Riding so far in the car with two teen and pre-teen boys plus a grown man is almost more than any woman should have to bear.  Between the farting and burping, there isn't much room for conversation.  It should prove to be a nice week away from the rat race that our lives have become.  My parents will be flying in to join us tomorrow and I really should be getting some sleep now.  I had good luck with scratch cards today, which I really never buy when at home, but on vacation, it seems that anything goes.  I won a total of 145.00 and spent only 22.00.   Not a bad profit.  Kind of makes up for having to sit with kids who burp and fart all day.....  "
24223,3500159,"02,June,2004",2004-06-02,"   Last night the metro area was hit by huge storms and we were without power for about 3 hours.  It got pretty creepy, just me, the kids, the dog and a bunch of candles burning.  They say it is headed our way again right now.  It made me realize that we depend on electricity and our TV's, Computers, etc. WAY too much!  My kids and I sat there in the dark and didn't quite know what to do......sad, huh?    We are supposed to be heading up to Tulsa tonight, but will have to wait until we see what the weather is going to do.   I hate this...I am ready to get on with my vacation and head north where it is cool!  "
24224,3500159,"29,July,2004",2004-07-29,"   Tonight I met one of my new students.  Yes he has some brain damage, but he understands right and wrong and knows what is expected of him.  He came into my class, rolled around on the floor, screamed at his parents, hit his baby sister, threw cars, etc....This is not the first child I have taught who was like this.  Do you think 4 minutes of time out will do this one any good?  Nope!  It sets him off more.  When my boys were little I never would have put up with rude, disrespectful behavior and yet these days it seems to be the norm.  The kids I teach are special ed, however, we have MANY who are very bright children who know how to manipulate better than any adult.  I am just thankful I don't have to LIVE with those kids!  "
24225,3500159,"27,July,2004",2004-07-27,"   Well, I can hardly believe it.&nbsp; Today was my last day of ""freedom"" before returning to work after summer vacation.&nbsp; Our summers in Keller are so short...we are only out about seven weeks and I am not quite finished recovering from last semester yet.&nbsp; Tomorrow it is back to the salt mines as they say.&nbsp; I'll have a few weeks to get used to my new kids and new schedules and then my graduate school will begin again!&nbsp; Why am I doing this to myself??&nbsp;&nbsp; I have to work, so that one is a no-brainer, but the grad school thing is just a personal achievement I really want to have.&nbsp; If I didn't have to drive all the way to Denton to attend classes it would not be so bad.&nbsp; Oh well, I guess I will just suck it up and do it anyway!   Scott and David are not at all happy either.  They go back next Tuesday...what I would give for one more week......  "
24226,3500159,"23,July,2004",2004-07-23,"   Wow!&nbsp; Today was quite a day!  While trying to be a good mom and take my boys for one last outing to Six Flags before school starts I was involved in the scare of my life!  Scott, David, and Scott's friend Jeff, and I had been at Six Flags all day and had a ton of fun even though it was very hot and humid today.&nbsp; We had to leave at 3:30 due to Scott and Jeff being due at a party (that's a blog for another time....not quite ready for these high school parties), so we decided to ride just one more ride and then go.&nbsp; Jeff and David opted for bumper cars while Scott and I just wanted one more roller coaster ride.&nbsp; We hopped on the Flashback as Jeff and David went to the bumper cars right next to our ride.&nbsp; The first part of our ride was fine, but then, as we were totally on the top, almost flat on our backs, VERY HIGH IN THE AIR, the thing jolted to a stop!&nbsp; At first I thought it was just going to stop for a second and then go, but as the seconds became a minute, I realized that we were stuck!&nbsp; And as I looked down below, there stood David and Jeff and all I could think about was that I was going to die on that thing and my little son was going to see the whole thing!&nbsp;&nbsp; Bearing in mind it was 101 degrees and I suddenly had to go to the bathroom, I began to panic just a bit.&nbsp; Scott, on the other hand, was having a ball.&nbsp; He said it was the best part of his day.&nbsp; Finally, after about 15 minutes (which is a LONG time when you are stuck on a roller coaster) they got it going again and all I could do was pray that this time when it stopped, we would be on the ground!&nbsp;   Thank you, Lord for getting us off there safely!!!  "
24227,3500159,"21,July,2004",2004-07-21,"   These last few weeks have been crazy.&nbsp; I suppose that time really does go faster when you get older, but it is hard to get anything accomplished when time is zooming by!   School starts back for me next week and the boys the week after that.&nbsp; My niece, Susan moved in with us two weeks ago after accepting a job in Human Resources at the Albertson's Division Office here.&nbsp; It has been lovely having her and not as much of an adjustment (at least for us) as I thought it would be.&nbsp; It is nice to not be the only woman in the house!&nbsp; She will be getting her apartment next month but for now I am trying to spoil her a bit.&nbsp;   My graduate courses will resume the end of August and while I dread the drive to Denton, I really want this degree badly.   I have been working out regularly lately.&nbsp; Dixie, Susan and I are attending Jazzercize four to five times a week and working out in the gym on other nights.&nbsp; I have never worked out so much and I hope it helps.   Our family is still reeling in the loss of my cousin and I still haven't been able to be much comfort to his parents.&nbsp; Of that, I am ashamed.&nbsp; I wish so much that I could reach out to them, but I am so aware that both my sons are alive and healthy and how is that fair?&nbsp;&nbsp;   On a lighter note, I have been able to spend some much needed time with a dear friend whom I had not seen in a year and that was lovely.&nbsp; My closets are cleaned out, my laundry is done and so I guess I can go back to work.......  "
24228,3500159,"01,August,2004",2004-08-01,"   Night before last I had the strangest dream and it really has me a little freaked out.  I dreamed that the whole family, Linda & Louis included were at this restaurant for someone's birthday celebration.  We were talking and suddenly the door opened and in walked Jeremy.   We all just were shocked and stared at him and didn't know what to think or how to behave because we all knew he had passed away in April, yet there he was, just like always, healthy as could be.....He smiled at us and said, ""Just joking guys!  I didn't really die!""   And then everyone was angry at him for the horrible joke, but so glad to see him too.....And when I woke up I felt so strange because I can't figure out what that all means.  I don't know if it means anything at all, but it was so real and yet so strange.   I wish he could come back.......it sure would make so many of us happy again.  "
13973,3503201,"23,June,2004",2004-06-23,"   Beware the storyteller, to often a liar does it conspireto make the soul cold, in lies does it enfold. Let no love shine your essence is not divine, forget, forget, f..o..r..g..e..t.   I have forgotten but I'll not believe the echoing lies swarming as flys to a carcass. GET OFF ME! I am free. Yet, I have forgotten, and more lies are begotten. Dead I am yet I am not caught between what was and what will be I am not free for these things exist conceptually only. Yet are very real when I hold on to what's gone or dream of dawns to days in which I cannot play. I have forgotten today. Forgotten today? Forgotten today!   Now! I remember the glowing ember that beats and repeats, and heats, it treats me with the gift of rhythm. Remind me of the moment of movement, with out premeditation, pure inspiration, an installation of authenticity, felicity. Bring me back to my center, I enter gratefully dead to what was and what will be, now I write history! Instead of history writing me,  now my future is not just a projection of my past, now I write free at last!   steer clear of me fear for if you draw near the piercing sound of loves laughter shall echo in your ear. Go ahead and lear fear do your judgments bring you cheer. My vision remains clear, your darkness is just the back drop for my light for as I see with loves sight, there is an end to the dark nights.   These times ain't about hocus pocus or dooms day locusts it about staying focused on our feelings. To climb past glass ceilings and set minds reeling, peeling back layers of lies that left us lying with flys feeding on the wounds to our truth our life, our love.  "
13974,3503201,"21,June,2004",2004-06-21,"   Aloha, translated literally means: In the presence of(Alo) the divine breath(Ha). This statement is used as hello, goodbye, and I love you. Aloha Now.  "
13975,3503201,"16,June,2004",2004-06-16,"   I soften my gaze to see clearly the haze, blurring formerly dividing lines inspiring rhymes of unity. Where rigidity turns to hilarity where if we just change our viewpoint then we can anoint ourselves with new understanding, demanding different behaviors, because in this instant you've become your own savior.   So rip yourself from the web you've woven. Isn't it time you claim youself stolen, from a world that keeps holden, old thought forms passed of as norms unconsciously we conform, awoken by a storm of our own creation, a synchronized place, to taste divine grace, witness the true face, like mace it will burn, illusions it will turn causing us to learn of our connection to life. Break free from the strife.   We've gotta take time to unwind our mind and find the first knot that got us caught in this perpetual tangle. I have come at this from so many angles, callin on all the angels. I have dangled of cliffs, repaired psychic rips, busted of clips into my own ego trips. Flipped scripts until it clicked that life is a circle, no one point on it is better or worse we are all equidistant from the center, the symbolic sun where all life begun and because of which will end only to begin again.   Mental Conflicts keep sending us sailing on a turbulent ocean, perilous waves of pitching emotion, no solid shores of which to be holden. Till we return to the shore that is golden. Turning trash into treasure pain into pleasure. Remember, remember?   Only ways things stay the same is that they change. Duality is just a mind game. Awareness burns through both opposites cop to it, and realize you will that you just swallowed the conscious pill.   Soon your sittin at the souls windowsill free to chill in your Zion I. Becoming a being in the world but not of it, knowing how to love it wholly. Hack back in but being aware of the agents vibing invisible contagents, memes based in fear and illusion, schemes created to continue the confusion, elude them, and transmute them, we will uproot them, We are the ones we've been waiting for. Can you feel the sands shifting are you listening.  "
13976,3503201,"10,June,2004",2004-06-10,"   Well this is just another movement of the mind, another space another time to find my inner divine. Alowing that light to shine and bear witness to the quickness with which it shapeshifts my reality. Transcending duality, the sacred fallacy we are but aren't living in.  See there are levels to what is true quite often differing from me to you. On the level of unity no opositions exist, over this truth your mind may trip, for to grasp this you must rip from the illusion that there is something that you are not. In this world so many are caught.   Identifying with the lying of the ages believe the body cages, the soul. But in truth does the soul enfold the physical. Now were getting mystical.   Knowing no boundries it confounds thee, because we identify with another lie that we are our ""mind"". The mind much like a mirror the less is on it the clearer, thus we draw nearer to the light of our source. Illuminating our course. The soul is the horse we are riding, but mentaly denying, and so we start crying feeling disconnected when we could be conntented to be in ease at one with all we see. All we have to do is be.   In line with the souls perspectives guided by divine directives, Illusions we will rout, collecting our clout, we will shout our love from above and below and let people know that peace never left us.  "

Let go of what you can't control, namely everything outside yourself. What is yourself? Remember to breath this too will pass. Remember to breath this too shall come again. Another reminder from the mirror.  "
13978,3503201,"06,June,2004",2004-06-06,"   Another breath I take make no mistake I know where I have faked myself out. Want to scream and shout about how I have been lost and found again. How the mind does bend from enemy to friend.   Where we tend to focus is what we'll find flowing to us. So I put my mind in the spaces where love can bloom light can zoom to cast out doom cause the two can't occupy the same place.   I give thanks to grace for the clarity to see, allowing me to be free to create consciously. Thank you love for clearing the clouds, illuminating the shroud that is so loud as to drowned out the still small voice.   The on going choice I see I remember I be.  "

Initially, an Aquarius may catch your attention by showing you their intellectual side and optimistic outlook. But as you get to know them better, you're likely to be even more drawn to an Aquarian's idealistic resolve and focus on making positive change. People born under this sign are frequently capable of seeing both sides in any dispute. This can make them quite talented when it comes to finding creative solutions in your relationship. Your Aquarius may be a bit headstrong at moments, but they'll also tend to look for the bright side in times of trouble. In the bedroom, you'll likely find the Water Bearer both discrete and cautious. An Aquarian will ordinarily make sure that all areas of your relationship are strong before plunging into sex. Overall, Aquarians are solid, unwavering partners and complex people. So, it may take you a little extra time to get to know your Aquarian match, but it's apt to be well worth the wait.   and now some free zodiac compatibility thingy at http://astrocenter.astrology.msn.com//msn/deptlove.aspx?af=-1000  Gemini & Aquarius    The Aquarian ability to devote body and soul to the cause of justice attracts the respect and love of the Gemini, who will vie to conquer this rare love.

However, I am starting to doubt the effectivity of this move, how will it make me forget that which lives in my heart? Is it possible to fall out of love when the love you've fallen INTO is more real and deeper than the greatest love ever immortalized in page and pen? Could I really forget the best moments in my life? Would it be fair, considering that I do not forget the worst moments all too easily?  You still look at me behind beady glasses and perhaps this steely wall that keeps your feeling locked away, hidden out of my sight. However I can still smell you, I can still see you, I can still feel you, and even though it might just be the carcass, the shell into which love was encased almost a year ago, I still love it, the way you cherish the gift's wrapping even though the gift is gone.   Nonetheless, the fact that love shines not through anymore, does not give your eyes that perfect glow  ... it breaks my heart and shatters the pieces into the finest dust. I yearn for a love that doesn't live anymore, I asked and pleaded once, and even though I plead no more, my heart still yearns and cries out for the soulmate you once were. Our past has been encased and pasted into the pages behind me, I cannot reach out and relive, too certain have you made it that there's no way to return to that ecstatic state of mind, body and soul, thet merge of two into the perfect ONE that made both parts... perfect ... just as you are.   ...yet again... for Heri.

Forever will I always be reminded of the very few nights we spent together, hearts and limbs entwined in a soul-embrace, drenched in the salty darkness of an evening by the beach ... or a kiss under the rain.

Uno no decide de quiÃ©n enamorarse, no obstante el mismo corazÃ³n posee un subconsciente (aparentemente) q puede distinguir entre aquellos q nos pueden daÃ±ar mediante la intensidad y aquellos que no.

How're things going?"" and I can't figure the damn thing out.    I can't pray.  I can't guess what this fucking beast wants or else I'd give it.  Right now.  I wish I could tell someone.  I need help.  Oh my God.  Is there anyway out of this?  Dan's talk about God's will just makes me think I need to handle this on my own, that the will is revealed in the word and whatever is there goes.  I've set up a meeting with Paul on Monday.  I don't know why.  I don't know what else there is to say.  I really want to die.  If I could without scarring my girls I would do it.  And I don't give a fuck if that is narcissistic.  I'm past caring.  So I suck, big fucking deal.  I always have sucked and tried to fix the suckage.  Who gives a shit, now?  I want to die.  I'm past being useful and over being a good friend.  I just maintain for my kids.  and I'm losing the ability to do that.  Can anybody help me?  can anybody hear me?  Fuck me.  The ship's going down, man.  Who cares?   "
8101,3522772,"09,June,2004",2004-06-09,"   Sigh...time realyy flies so fast...without me realising, a week has passed and I haven't thrashed out anything in here. Have been busy with work..meetings here and there...really killing me softly...but told maself not to get any negative further...self-control...patience....those are the keys in achieving happiness..(dunno how true actually)... By the way..what shit am I typing? Craps and nothing but craps...   Sometimes I wonder...why am I fated to meet someone so nice but I can't have him eventually? Is it called  fate when I was the one who initiated to get to know him? whereas I can jolly well stop myself from chatting... but to stop chatting after I got hooked to it for 10 years?- how to, man? People come and go in our life..but some nice ones are there to stay...linger in your life....make you feel appreciated that you form part of their lives... but at the end of the day, one special person that stands out from the crowd is still not YOURS!!!!!!!   Recently...encountered someone from the net..obviously he appeared the suspicious sort..I couldn't care much..but he never fail to make my day with his sweet thoughtful, funny SMSes...somehow..I began to open up to get to know him better... he indeed is a nice person...friendly...funny...and the best part is...he is a true gentleman!!!!. When we first met...I never thought that he would turn up..you know lah..those blind dates..never seems to turn out rite...but he is an exception..Indeed he still makes a gd impression up till this very moment. We had a supper at Fisherman's Village..with live fire shows...nice calamaris...and we practically talk anything under the sun....ooopsss...moon I should say...   "

11394,3525639,"03,June,2004",2004-06-03,"   so, on sunday, i'm throwing a pair of flip flops on when my cell phone beeps -    ""fucking people are out of their god damn minds!""  recognizing the voice as my best friend's, i let her ramble   ""so, i try to call you from my new cell phone thinking i'm all slick because i memorized your number, and i get disconnected after two rings...ok, fine, so i redial, and instead get this dude's voicemail..so i think, hey, i'm an asshole, i'll just cave in and look up the number because i obviously fucked it up....about 30 seconds later i get a phone call from the wrong number i dialed previously with this bitch on the line saying ""yo, why you be calling?""  so i'm like ""right, well, sorry, i fucked up, i dialed the wrong last digit"" and the chick on the other line goes ""slut"" and hangs up - but wait, holy fucking shit, here's this crazy bitch again, hold on!""   so, she clicks over, and i'm holding, for what seems like a really long time, when she clicks back and announces    ""dude! according to this bitch i'm a crack slut dirty whore who this psycho's boyfriend can't afford to fuck because he's too broke..i need to go outside because it's a nice day and find some john to fuck because i am nothing but a nasty trick...yes, you heard it, i'm nasty"" she then breaks down into peals of laughter which then sends me skipping down cackle road....  so, whatever, i finally get to jersey, and we're sitting outside on her deck, polishing off a bottle of stoli (raspberry natch)when she gets the idea to call this dude back and flip out on him...so, she tells me to call from my cell because it's only 1 digit off from this random guys...so, drunk fool that i am, i dial and, what do you know, it rings and then goes to voicemail, so, not wanting to start a voicemail war, i hang up.  So, we continue drinking, and slurring and laughing when suddenly my phone rings...it's the dude   ""hey ma....listen, i just want to apologize for my girlfriend..she's a little psycho..i'm charging my phone in my car right now so she doesnt see me on the phone...she get's really pissed when girls be calling my number and shit""     uh...right, so dumbass that i am, i continue talking to him   ""so like, my name's david...are you and friend single and shit? cuz like, ya'll be soundin sexy and shit ""    ok, so that's the point my friend rips the cell phone out of my hand and yells into the phone  ""ok, this is the reason that your skanky bitch thinks you're cheating on her, what the fuck is wrong with you...you're trying to pick up 2 girls from a wrong number call...go back to your bitch""   and hangs up the phone.... she shakes her head and pours me another drink....  my cell rings again   ""hey, it's david, so like, it's really cool how our numbers are only a digit off yo, like, you be into swingin' and shit?""   good lord...   ""cuz like, me and my girl, we like to swing....""   that's when i burst out laughing and hung up the phone..... me and my friend finished off the bottle of vodka, chain smoked for a while and went to bed....fucking people are out of their god damn minds...and shit  "
11395,3525639,"02,June,2004",2004-06-02,"   i am in the midst of trying to find a new place to live...at this point, my future roommate and I have abandoned any picky tendencies and are clinging to the idea that we'll find a decent size place that is cat friendly (yes, he's one of  those  people...*shudder*), in a relatively convenient area that is not on the 7th floor of a shithole walkup.  So far, we are not discouraged....we are hopeful, wistful jersey expats ready to challenge and conquer the manhattan real estate market...let's see how long this hopefulness lasts.

He's left me all alone in an office where most are either heavily medicated or those that aren't should be.  It's up to me to amuse myself at work, and lemme tell ya kids, it aint going too well.

20715,3538351,"21,June,2004",2004-06-21,"    It's amazing, isn't it, that someone's life can end so suddenly, while everyone else is forced to keep on living. How you can be with someone one night at a party, and then the next morning they die in a car accident. My friend Bradley C. Lybbert did just that. He was killed in a car accident on the way to his high school graduation on Sunday June 13, 2004. He had just been at a party, that I was also at, the night before. And then I find out the next morning that he is gone. It is events like these that make you realize that you don't know when your time is going to come to leave this life. It is times like these that make you realize that you aren't invincible and neither are the ones you love. Brad was a very good young man. He was fun to be around and talk to, he was a very good friend and a really kind person. He is going to missed very much. We will never forget you Bradley. Thank you for being a part of out lives and blessing us. We will miss you, but we will see you again in Heaven.   "
20716,3538351,"04,June,2004",2004-06-04,"    Okay yesterday I said that things come in 3's. Well I found out that it holds true for good things too. My third good thing is that I got into AP English for next year. I'm really happy about that and I really wanted wo get into it. I however did not become one of the Vice Presidents for National Honor Society for next school year. I'm kinda bummed about because I would ahve liked to get the chance to be a leader in my school. I've run for class office twice without getting elected and now I won't have the chance to be a leader in NHS. I guess I'm just not supposed to have such a big leadership role at my school. Maybe there is something else I am supposed to do ot maybe the Lord knows that i will be really busy next yeatr that He is protecting from extra stress. I don't know. Maybe someday i will know. But for now things, good and bad, come in 3's.   "
20717,3538351,"03,June,2004",2004-06-03,"    People often say that ad things come in threes. But do good things come that way too? If so, then I have 1 more good thing coming, but there are two things which I'm trying for, so which will it be? Alomost 2 weeks ago I became a new member of the South Kitsap High School Acting Ensemble for the 2004-2005 school year. Good thing #1. Then that saturday I became South Kitsap's Junior Miss 2004. I get $1000 for any college I want and I get to go to state in January. I'm so excited. Good thing #2. Now I would like to get into AP English for next school year and I would like to be a Vice President of National Honor Society for next year. So which whill it be? or will I prove the 3-theory wrong and have either 4 good things happen, or maybe only 2? I guess I'll find out soon! As for me I hope to prove the 3-theory wrong, with having 4 good things happen.   "
2896,3539593,"28,June,2004",2004-06-28,"   Finally found the time to sit down and write again.  Nine-to-fiving it is not my cup of mint-tea, but I'm slowly adapting (is that a good or a bad thing?).  Anyways, much has happened in these first three weeks that needs proper rambling to be put into place.  Let's see...  LARPed over the weekend.  If you are among the vast majority of sane Americans who don't know what that is then shame on you for not opening your mind, broadening your horizons, and all that other uncreative crap.  www.masi.us should give you an idea of what I'm talking about.  So I spent the weekend in the woods, rain soaked, mosquito drained, bruised, bloodied, and shamelessly covered in mud - in otherwords: in absolute bliss.  I find it funny how I like spending a weekend busting my ass for the enjoyment of others better than getting blitzed and hanging out at a party.  I always knew college life wasn't my scene, but it's frighteningly easy to be sucked into believing that it is what I should like, even now that I've gradumutated.  "
2897,3539593,"11,June,2004",2004-06-11,"   So I've settled in to my first week of work and I just discovered that I'm psychic.  All day I've walked into the room just as someone said my name, or picked up the phone the second someone called me.  I was thinking of writing a letter to someone and they appeared in front of me.  Needless to say, things are good. The apartment's great - my roomates, likewise - and my neighbors are quite friendly.  I think this is going to be a great summer.  At least it's been a great week.   I was a little bothered that I wasn't going to be able to make it to my brother's bachelor party - I still have two more weeks until I get paid, and I'm sufficiently broke to be unable to make it down to boston.  But true to uncanny form, the party I was fretting missing got cancelled.  Things have a funny way of working out. So I'm making dinner with Kate and Laurel tonight - two classy chicks who redefine the meaning of cool.  This came as the end of a long held phobia of mine, asking a girl out to dinner.  Don't get me wrong, I've been in numerous relationships of all levels of intimacy.  I've just never felt comfortable asking someone out to dinner.  Requesting casual sex hasn't posed a problem, but, there's I've always been reluctant to ask for their culinary company.  This may say something about my priorities. Anyways (stalling for thoughts)...   work has been good so far.  I like my job, picking up where I left off last summer after I got laid off during the school year.  Nothing's more embarassing than being laid off from a campus job.  Well, I can think of a few notable exceptions, but it still sucks. So I'm here, back at college but without the homework.  Just how I like it.  I can tell the group of people I'm living with (there's five more or less living in my apartment now) are going to be a load of fun.  We're already planning the 50 Drinking Games in One Night Party.  *Sigh*  Irresponsible young adult life is good.  "
2898,3539593,"05,June,2004",2004-06-05,"   Drove to Portland with my mother today to get measured for a tux for my brother's wedding.  The man working at the suit-store surprised me with his grace and professionalism.  I have seen few people in my life more respectable or confident in what he was doing.  Made me feel older, more professional myself.  Funny the places inspiration strikes.  It's utterly surreal that my brother is getting married this summer.  He's always been somewhat distant from me, but then I feel I've always been somewhat distant from my life in general.  These brief islands of meaningful family events crop up every now and then, but it's far from the photo-album impressions of adulthood I had in my youth.  I guess this is part of my passage into manhood, letting go of the dream that I'll suddenly wake up one day and know what's going on.  I hate terms like passage into manhood and coming of age, but I can't help but chuckle at the truth of them when I come out the other side.  Whoever is writing this story of mine sure has a funny sense of irony.   The highlight of an otherwise disappointing (1:5 odds my ass) and depressing day (good-bye, Gipper) had to be the discovery that I know how to make pizza.  This noble task had always fallen to my brother when we were children, but I surpised myself and my parents for reinventing the not-quite-from-scratch art of pizza making in the Powell House.  Beats the Crispy Chicken from Burger King I had for breakfast.  For those of you who don't know me, I am one of the few people I've ever met who has a bitter dislike with breakfast foods.  Muffins, bagels, eggs of all textures and viscosities, toast, fruit, pancakes, waffles, and worst of all breakfast ceareal - long have these morning delights plagued my strange and twisted stomache.  When I get up in the morning all I want is a burger.  Is that so unusual?  If you were starving in the desert which would you rather, a bowl of cold, mushy, sugar-satured grains, or a pound of sizzling beef draped in the warm embrace of cheese?  I must admit, I was a part-time vegetarian during my college years, but the thought of breakfast foods for breakfast still ran chills through my bones and waves of nausea through my stomache.  Anyways.  I'm off for an icecream sandwich and some tums.  Maybe that'll cheer me up.  "
2899,3539593,"04,June,2004",2004-06-04,"   And how!  For the first day in over two weeks, there's sun.  Beautiful, life-giving sun.  And a nice cool breeze.  I feel inspired.  I even vacuumed this morning.  I must be coming down with something.  Breaking in the dancing feet again.  There's nothing quite like the guilty pleasure of blasting 'NSYNC and Backstreet and busting out some new moves across the family-room floor when you're home alone.   urlLink Tom Cruise  would be proud.  I seem to have gotten the spring back to my step again.  The knees aren't aching any more.  There's nothing worse than creaky joints before you make it half-way to middle-age.  (Side note: I seem to be going hyphen-happy lately - weird)  I just wrote something interesting, but lost it when I went to  urlLink dictionary.com  to look up the word 'sans'.  I knew I knew what it meant, but I wanted to be sure.  Part of my newly blossoming, self-imposed OCD I suppose.  And now I've gone and lost a paragraph that I was excited to write.  I mean, how many times do you get to use 'sans' in casual conversation?   Paragraph sans excitement. Paragraph sans point. Oh well.  I find myself utterly paralyzed, staring at the trees blowing in the wind.  I thought it chintzy when John Travolta did it in  urlLink Phenomenon , but there's something to be said for simple pleasures.  Idle tree watching would be tops on my list.  Followed closely by supermanning into my super-soft futon, slipping on socks fresh from the dryer on a chilly day, mint lip balm, and of course killing kittens.  (Side note: I would never, in fact,  urlLink harm a kitten  - chickens on the other hand, they just creep me out and I'm happy to  urlLink commit mass chickencide  - you see I knew this flock of free range chickens when I was in Australia - they were awesome - anyways, my favorite chook somehow hurt hurself and started bleeding when suddenly her carniverous band of merry hens decided to peck her to death and fight over her vital organs - if that doesn't convince you  urlLink this will )  Good God, I can't believe I'm up before noon.  I just don't know what to do with myself.  I suppose I should go out and enjoy the sun while it's decided to make an appearance, but I'm afraid it's just a hoax.  Mother Nature luring us outside so She can dump two more weeks of rain on our heads.  Just to punish us further for living in Maine.  I can't wait to get out of this place.  But I will miss it.  "
2900,3539593,"03,June,2004",2004-06-03,   urlLink    Just think about it.&nbsp;  
2901,3539593,"03,June,2004",2004-06-03,"   So, I finally came to that place. You know, the ultimate post-show let down.  Only the show lasted four years and was kinda called my College Education - or more hiply - my College Experience.  Like four years of putting up with cynical (but loveable) yuppies wasn't enough, now I either have to become a corporate potato or flee the country to avoid 40k plus in college loans that I *slightly* remember taking.   I think the biggest thing I'm going to miss about old Bowdoin will be the food.  I loved that dining hall.  1st in the nation, damn straight.  That and the bathroom.  I will always be fond of a person that cleans my puke from the sink and smiles at me the next day.  Joyce, you are my personal angel for that.   So that place I was talking about.  You all know it.  Sitting at home.  Wondering how you survived four years of this through highschool.  Feeling like a stranger in the one place you've called home all your life, but which now has the dull name of your Parent's House.  And everyone keeps asking you in hushed tones if you've thought of your future yet, like it's some sort of insider joke - boy you must be asked that a lot.  Well no.  I haven't been asked that nearly enough.  And certainly not enough from the sort of people who would inspire me to actually want to find my calling in life.  You know the type of person I'm talking about; the ones you ask for a cup of sugar and they somehow get you to join the Peace Corps.   I'm ranting now, trying to sound like a real writer whose long-winded tirades somehow worm their way into your heart and make you feel all fuzzy inside.  I hate and love that shit, much like most of that shit out there I guess.  But where does that get me?  Four years of putting the liberal in my liberal arts career (we're talking Women's Studies, Government, Buddhism, Italian, Spanish, Native American spirituality, even a class on Japanimation and Manga!) and out of all of that, I think my greatest classes were in cynicism and lethargy.  Is this really what yuppies do for fun?  Am I doomed to analyze a life that I only half live in moments of lucid daydreaming?  Can I think of some witty or poignent end to this, my first entry, one that will let me go back to obsessively checking my email and wishing someone would come on instant messenger?   Or is this, as the movies asks, as good as it gets?   Well, I doubt it.   But if I'm going to start living that life I've dreamt of, might as well start here at home.  I guess I should dig that Computer Science diploma out of the glove box where I left it graduation day (I still don't understand a Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science) and put it to some sort of use.   Even if I couldn't afford the $100 frame for it.  "
2902,3539593,"27,July,2004",2004-07-27,"   Alright. So I've been avoiding writing in my blog for too long.  I tried to be all clever and witty and expressive with my writing, but it just turned into a cheap immitation.  So I stopped writing.  I put my head down and tried to plow through this summer, as if something better were waiting on the other side.  Some other time I'd have the inspiration to begin writing again.  Well, bullshit.  This is not a work of art, or at least that should not be its driving force.  This is my conscience, my voice, and my mirror.  I don't even think there's a single person out there who reads it, so it's about time to put these words to good use - that is, to start making some consistent sense out of my life.  I'm always afraid to write about my philosophies - they sound so trite and self-riteous when I go back to read them later (I think trite and self-riteous describes most of philosophy for that matter).  Writing through self-consciousness is bit like shooting through a slump in basketball, only way to get your rhythm back is to keep at it.  So that's what I'm doing.  The best thing I ever did for writing was keep a 'throw away' notebook.  I made myself just write whatever, not worrying about its quality, all the time knowing this was just excercise - nothing I would want to keep for later.  It gets me out of my head.  Softens my focus, so I'm not so worried about the product, and more invovled and interested in the process.  It's also really good for organizing my thoughts.  Not necessarily so I can sort out specific thoughts, but so that my mind becomes comfortable with following through on moments of inspiration.  It's a matter of tricking my mind into getting out of the way so my self can come through.  I like that description.  Anyways, that's what this was supposed to be, and that's what it shall be.  Maybe eventually I can stop writing about my writing and get on with my writing.  Here's to perfect simplicity.  "
2903,3539593,"07,July,2004",2004-07-07,"   Something beautiful just happened:   I was looking for apartments in San Francisco and came across a message written by a woman out there.  Something about it inspired me.  Here's the response I wrote:   ...I couldn't shake the feeling of laying on my back in a field of daisies, coaxing the clouds with my eyes into giant whales and majestic sky ships, sails billowing to carry them off to some distant horizon.  Lately I've been reluctantly shutting myself off from lazy afternoons in my mind, trying to focus myself on a world that I can only half imagine somewhere out in the mysterious 'there', where careers are made and my debts repaid.  I used to love weaving little stories, little patchworks of pictures and poems, little rhymes like daisy-chains to set on my head as king of the clouds, happy on my throne of words.  But the words left me.  My education sapped from me the nectar I squeezed from life, the simple pleasures I had idly sipped upon, oblivious of how good I had it.  Somehow the belief that I must reach for more - become something more - sucked the air from my sails and set me to dreaming of distant cities filled with busy people with busy jobs and busy lives.  But like the clouds I kept these visions far above me, distant, safe.  I stayed close to home, pushing my way through college in the town in which I was born.  Under the watchful wisdom of the white pines of my home I forced myself into a culture and a society that turned my stomach and suffocated my dreams.  Somehow I limped through, earned my piece of paper that qualifies me fit for fine society, and arrived here - half-way to middle age, searching for a new place to settle down and begin my second life.  This morning I was searching for an apartment, a career, a lifestyle in a city where I thought I could see myself living.  This afternoon, I found myself in a field of daisies.  I don't quite know why, but I feel like after reading your post I woke up - not from a dream - but into a dream, a familiar dream where the edges of the world are soft and forgiving and open to gentle breezes and light touches.  I don't know who you are, but I wanted to give to you my deepest thanks for reminding me how to see.  May peace, wisdom, and grace always be with you, A young man from a distant coast.  "
2904,3539593,"07,July,2004",2004-07-07,"   I've done it; I've decided where I want to live and stake out my fortune.  San Francisco seems to have it all: crazy stuff to do; crazy, openminded people; crazy weather; and crazy money to be made.  And crazy suits me just fine.  This comes after a near-miss with an impending depression that forced me to take a sober look at my life (well, I wasn't exactly sober at the time, but perhaps a sobering look at my life).  My brother got hitched over the weekend (beautiful ceremony, reception, and all - Virginia sure is purty) and his friends got me blitzed.  14 hours of riding cramped in the back seat of our Impala brought me back to my parent's house.  I'm not sure which is more contricting, being sealed in the back of a car with a raging hangover or being secuestered at my former home without license or wheels to set me free.  "
11703,3541469,"13,June,2004",2004-06-13,"   Ok...this entry is about the solo walk i had in the camp. Basically there r six stations and at each station the station master will give you the password for you to tell it to the next station master. The first one is where all of us gather and have an exciting briefing >:D. This briefing is held by our senior who has graduated in the school. Each one got to take turns to begin the walk and there will be a 3-minute interval. At the first station, there were a lot of scaredy cats, mainly my juniors, who were whimpering and well...pissing me off. The senior began to tell them to stop being scared and start doing the solo walk because he will keep on telling stories about the school (real or not i dunno but i hope its real >:D) after one guy goes. 1 impression he gave me...our school is real haunted man. Let me share with you some...  1)During the Japanese occupation, our school was the headquarters of the Japanese army and there were many prisoners in the opposite of the building. In between the 2 buildings, there was a canal. The headquarters overlooked the canal. So if there were any escapers, soldiers would bring them to a room located in the headquarters and torture them. The room was called the Torture room. Now the room is a classroom located in the clock tower of our school. It was said that the room will unlock itself...because my senior said that once when he was camping in this school when it was nearing the exam period during his last year. Everyone would be studying and he had asked his friend where did he study. He said he studied in the classroom...shouldn't all the classrooms be locked at the night by then?  2)My school is a very famous school and it was founded by someone who is a good and famous man, by the name of Tan Kah Kee. We had a statue of him and it was said that during midnight, he would come down and patrol the whole school. And if you had a chance of bumping into him, he would ask you what the time is. If u tell him, he would give u a slap and walk away...  3)In the year 1999, there was a boy who played in the school band. Once he went to the school hall to practise. In our school hall, there were many big square holes which linked to different parts of the school downstairs. And that boy had fell down to one of the holes, straight down to the squash court. The next day, someone discovered him...dead.  So, how's my storytelling skills? Hope you can comment on them ^^  Well, When i had my turn of doing the walk, i erased all of spooky thoughts in my mind and changed them to CS thoughts! ^^ I was thinking about CS during the whole walk.  P.S. The creator of this blog will not be responsible if the ghost stories told are fictional.  "
11704,3541469,"06,June,2004",2004-06-06,"   Hey im back...and im here to talk about how the camp is like! Well the camp is quite fun to me...there was something like the amazing race, a solo walk (u get to walk around solo in the school after midnite...i'll be talking about it in the next post) and some fun activities. I have gain much during the camp and i mean it cos my team won in the camp and i got prizes (even tho i dont like them...)! In all, it was a wonderful experience for me ^^  "
11705,3541469,"06,June,2004",2004-06-06,"   Man...I don't believe it...my mum says if she catch me playing CS again, im in deep sh*t. In other words, she has grounded me!!! Why? Because of my results. Keep comparing me with my sister. WTF!! Life isn't fair!! Hope she goes out everytime so that i could enjoy myself ^^ Anyway...LIFE SUCKS  "
11706,3541469,"04,June,2004",2004-06-04,   Tis the day when i created my first entry...felt excited.

27038,3542735,"04,June,2004",2004-06-04,"   Over the past few days her eyes had said a story, which he could not comprehend. May be it was one of her moods, he thought. And he did not think again about it.  Then a day before, he had seen her talking on the phone, softly else someone would hear. Something inside him irked. The signs were not right. He asked why she looked upset, she said she wasnâ€™t. Still he somehow knew who she was talking to, and what was in store over the next few days. And still he chose not to face reality. He could not continue like that. And then, he dared himself, and asked her. She said â€œHeâ€™s back. I havenâ€™t told it to anyone, but I am sure itâ€™s him. When I told him, we both were shocked. He didnâ€™t call me up for a week. Itâ€™s still sinking in. Finally, I gave in. I would have told you once everything would have been settled.â€ A stunned silence befell between them. He fell back on the chair. A bolt from the past had come and hit him. He was out and, He was in. He lost his temper, fewer words, and more expressions came out. He felt a revulsion against her from with in. He wanted to get back at her. He wanted to be so, so bad. Hurt her, in ways only which he could. He wanted to be bad, so desperately. Still, he couldnâ€™t. All along he knew, someday this would happen. They were poles apart, two sides of the coin. But still they were somehow the same, like internally two sides of the coin are attached. Her one sentence had cut the coin into two. He was angry. Angry at what or whom, he did not know. Was it her or was it her choice or was it his own fault of accepting what had to happen. Somewhere, something died between them. They would not, and could not be the same.  Well, itâ€™s going to be an awkward time from now on. Betrayal hurts. When close friends betray, it cuts, worse than a knife. Is it betrayal or is it his over estimation of a person. May be, it was the latter. He was an open person. Nothing was hidden. But may be people are not like that. They tell what is asked. May be it was time for him to change. He looked at the road. It continued till it blurred into the horizon. He picked up his bag, patted the dust off, and took out a small knife, cut his life mantra on to a rock. Another milestone, which he would remember someday, sitting and smiling about. Surely he would.  Dedicated to  The Lives I have Lived The Deaths I have Died And The Women I have Loved.  He wrote, and walked away into the horizon.   "
27039,3542735,"04,June,2004",2004-06-04,"   She was sleeping on her train seat. Her face was so perfect. She seemed so much in peace with herself. He couldnâ€™t help but look at her and how she exuded pure serenity. His palm on his face, his eyes glued to her, there was a faint smile of disbelief on his lips. How could someone be so beautiful? She seemed to sense his question, her eyes opened a little. She saw him sitting beside and looking at her. Astonished, turning her face she silently looked back, still holding the thought, â€œWhat are you doing?â€ He was so much in awe of her that on seeing her awake he still couldnâ€™t turn away. He kept on looking at her. And then the quizzical expression came on her face. He blushed. She had found his secret. He looked at her, smiled, as if telling her, â€œThe same as always.â€ And he kept on staring at her. She saw the expression on him, understood what he wanted to say. She smiled, in happiness and in all the possibilities it opened for them, and then closed her eyes again, went back to sleep.  He kept on looking at her, his palm on his face, still thinking what had he done? He hadnâ€™t been able to tell her how much he loved her, for over a year. And now, even without speaking, he knew that she understood. Silence had spoken what words couldnâ€™t. He looked out of the window, at the lonely moon in the night sky, thinking how much he loved her.   "
27040,3542735,"04,June,2004",2004-06-04,"   He lay there battered and bruised under scorching sun. Unable to move he was in terrible pain. He could not even raise his hands. Sweat mixed with blood from his wounds trickled all over him. He could not think of anything. Only what seemed to be comprehensible was the severe pain he felt all over. Apart from the pain, which he now felt a part of himself; he was at complete peace with himself and his surroundings. And suddenly his world began to tremble. His whole body was shaking now. His mind trying to re-collect and re-examine his current state. Where was he and what was this trembling and shaking all about?  As if someone heard his mindâ€™s plea, there was a loud whistle. Was there a train approaching? What was a train doing here? Where was he? And then he saw a green light. Itâ€¦it was a signal for an approaching train. Oh God, he was on a train track. This realization brought back the pain he had till now found a part of his existence. He could barely open his eyes. They were swollen. Using immense will power he opened his eyes. He saw a train turn towards where he way lying. It seemed to be a super fast.  He tried to shout, but he could not. He did not have the energy. Tried raising his hands, but they wouldnâ€™t leave the ground. The hot train tracks burning into him. His legs were not responding. He felt immense pain and remorse at himself. He wanted to react to the situation. But what would that yield? The pain again seemed to go into the background. His mind became clear. He had a choice to make. Either he would try to get off the track and save himself or he would let the train run him over and finish all misery once and for all. He had to decide this, and that too fast as the train had turned the corner and was coming nearer and nearer. The whistles of the engine getting louder. He closed his eyes trying to think. Suddenly, as if in a slide show, the pictures of his life came dancing in front of him. He saw his childhood. His parents. Remembered their aspirations. He saw his school. His friends. His first date and the movies. He saw the wrong decisions he made, and why he was where he was right now. And as soon as he thought that, the pain became excruciating. He opened his eyes and saw the train even closer. The whistle louder and piercing. But there was no way to get out of the current mess. Part of him wanted to end it all. Finish it off, once and for all. People would cry for a few days and then they would lead their lives. With the amount of pain he was in, the crushing of his bones by the incoming train would not even feel much. Or may be he would suffer an arrest from the shock. He was realizing what death was like. He was seeing the difference between life and death. And as far as he thought of his current self, there wasnâ€™t much of a difference. He weighed his options. He could not move his body an inch. Would someone come crashing down like an angel and take him off the track or would the train stop. But these things only happened in movies. Not in real life. He was destined to die here.  But somewhere inside him, someone wanted to live and show the world what he was made up of. He was a born fighter. A person who came back from the ruins like a Phoenix. He would fight and get over his despair. He wanted to live.  The voices of within were getting as loud as the whistle of the approaching train. But now he had an answer. He wanted to live. He wanted to fight. He tried to move his legs but could not. Using all his power, he was trying to trudge his way out. His body was not co-operating, but he tried on. The train was now even closer. Using his elbows he tried to trudge, but could not. And the anguish became so much that he resigned to die here on the track. He closed his eyes, remembered his parents and God. And with Elvisâ€™s song on his lips, he closed his eyes. â€œGood bye mama, pray for meâ€¦â€¦â€¦. I was the black sheep of the familyâ€¦â€¦â€¦.a hundred miles â€¦â€¦â€¦milesâ€¦â€¦.from home.â€ The tracks were shaking because of the incoming super fast. He was waiting for the pain to end. But why was it taking so long? Why does this moment of truth have to be in slow motion?  And then there was a shrieking sound. This must be it, he thought. But still the pain persisted. He tried hard to open his eyes. The train was passing in front of him. He was on the other track. Tears rolled down his eyes. He tried to smile. The pain was easing out. He shouted in ecstasy. Miracles do happen. He had been given this new lease of life. Now nothing could happen. He lay there feeling himself getting better. The tracks were still trembling but he paid no heed to it. What a relief, he was alive. He would go back and create a new world. He lay there getting his strength back. And then came a loud shrieking noise. He felt a big thud. And after that nothing. The signal of his track was green.   "
201,3544826,"08,june,2004",2004-06-08,"   This was a big moving weekend.  Now we are living in a cavern of boxes.  The question is always ""where is my..."" or ""where is the...""  I was still packing while the movers were carrying stuff down.  It was so much work! At one point I sneezed and saw stars.  I never saw them so clearly.  Usually there is just a vague swimming something that disappears quickly, but this time I saw little perfectly round pinpoints of colored light that swam in little arcs, leaving fading trails behind them.  My little girl (my real daughter, not my inner little girl) is desperate.  What with all the moving and hauling and searching for things and cleaning and stuff, there is no one to play with her, to pay her attention, to take her to the park.  Remember ""it takes a village""?  Where is the damn village?  We had a babysitting come by for a couple hours, and it was beautiful.  "

Bush, as much in the dark as anyone, replied, ""We will find that out soon. That's what [UN envoy] Mr. Brahimi is doing; he's figuring out the nature of the entity we'll be handing sovereignty over.""  In other words, you'll find out when I do.  The difficulty for the White House is that no one there knows anything about Iraq.  This is why they first called for elections and afterward realized that a free election would probably make Iraq a Shiite state (similar to Iran).  Whoops!  At first, it seemed like  urlLink  a complicated caucus-based election   would be the best way to control the result, but Iraqis saw through it.  So the White House threw up their hands and appealed to Brahimi...  ""The problem was that the Americans, after first agreeing to [Brahimi's] idea of a technocratic government, had changed their minds. They accepted the complaints of their friends on the governing council that they could not all be shunted aside. The Americans were also afraid that genuine independents might call for a US troop pullout.""  "

204,3544826,"29,july,2004",2004-07-29,"   I saw a few news celebrities:  Chris Matthews talking on his cell phone, Tony Blankly yakking with somebody.  So it was not very exciting.  But do you know who is all over town?  LaRouche's people.  I was sitting outside Faneuil Hall, where unfortunately, they've staked out a prime piece of the marketplace.  Over to my left is Chris Matthews ""Hardball"" stage, and in front of me are a bunch of the LaRouchers trying to hand out their campaign literature.  I tried to give off a ""not interested"" vibe, but in the end one of them came to talk to me, and I figured what the hell.  I talked to her.  It was not a pleasant conversation.  Everything I said, she contradicted.  She changed things I said to bend them to her point of view.  She had an answer instantly ready for any political problem.  Not a practical solution, though: just drastic, crazy stuff, like ""put all the banks into receivership"" and ""start bankruptcy proceedings on the IMF.""  In the end, she started getting aggressive, and so I left.  I've heard the LaRouchers described as a  urlLink political cult , and that fit with the weird feeling I got from the girl.  "

What I got out of it was information and visual learning about fish and sharks. Although I am not coming next year, somewhere that you can go next year to learn about animals, besides the zoo, is the rodeo or to the H & H Ranch, maybe you can go to Moody Gardens.  "

My mom saw a ghost once, this happened about 10 years ago. My aunt saw a ghost, well, I'm not sure if it was an actual ghost, but she said it was a monster. the monster was sitting on the bed next to her daughter. She said she was yelling at the ""monster"" to leave her daughter alone, the next night, the ""monster"" was gone.  "
23581,3545726,"15,June,2004",2004-06-15,"   A time when I have felt as though I was in a haunted place was when I was at Mexico. I was at my Aunt's house, and my cousins and I were telling old mexican stories and myths. We were in a circle outside at night, around a small campfire. One of the stories was about La Llorona and her children. Another was about the candyman. We didn't try saying ""candyman"" three times, everyone was too scared to do it. I felt scared, i don't know why, maybe because of the candyman or maybe because it was dark at the time.  "

My mom is there whenever I need her. Even though she works 9 to 10 hours a day, she still manages to pay attention to her children. These times are really hard for her, economically and emotionally. To me, she is the most important person in the world, especially in this time of my life.  "
23583,3545726,"09,June,2004",2004-06-09,"   One really famous tradition for females is a Quinceanera. A Quinceanera is a celebration when a female turns 15. It's basically the only cultural tradidition that I know and is Mexican. I, personally, didn't have a Quinceanera, but I had a party when I was 16. I didn't want a Quinceanera because my parents couldn't afford it. My sister doesn't want a Quinceanera, she wants a Sweet Sixteen. There are so many things involved in doing a Quinceanera. For me, there's too many things to do, and it's too hard to organize it. First of all, you need the Damas and the Chambelanes.  "

The mornings are pleasant enough--that's when I like to go to my friend's pool (on my days off, which are few these two weeks--the ole' dollar calls when bills are to be paid)--anyway, back to the pool, and lie in the sun toasting. Of course I use sunscreen--only idiots from elsewhere refuse to block their tender skin. Five minutes and sizzling may occur. Went over there last night after work and dove right in. No hesitation. 105 I believe the temp was. Had a couple of Coronas with lime, had dinner, and went home, and slept so well that I didn't want to rise an shine. And now it's Saturday and I'm at work (not a usual gig, but it's okay now and then). I will work until 5, then it's to home I go. Perhaps another dip in the pool. Who knows? But it is an hour drive...thank God I'm moving soon. Only five minutes from work then, but an hour from my friends.  So is this a boring post or what? I don't care--it's just a way to release some pent-up anxiety and boredom....  Pissed off about the war, but what to do? A little late to pull out--not another Viet Nam on our hands. Blood shed for nothing. Double-speak is what we get. And how dare our government ""confuse"" the plight of Afghanistan with Iraq--how dare Bush link the Taliban with Hussein...sneaky, eh?

I wonder how I can find others...like that Japanese man who became an internet wanderkind with his blogging interests and so forth....Sure like to talk to some other bloggers...Anyone interested in a dialogue about whatever????  
13966,3546432,"04,June,2004",2004-06-04,"   Today has been a thug day, not a thought day. And now you ask, what is a thug day? It is a day in which my thoughts are scattered and non-cohesive, like rain water sheeting through a Tucson sky (usually azure). There are days when thought days are worse than thug days because thought days lead to obsessing about tomorrow, over which I no control.   And I am new at this, so revealing too much at one time is not an option.  I wonder how to read others' journals...  "

The locks of darkness were as tightly woven as that of her life, where she was breathing and living with a feeling of being caught up helplessly and off guard, wanted to come out of it..get over it, but things got worst at even a slight move,it was as if the strands tightened around her, hurting her badly, making her cry ,but the depth of darkness was deep enough to absorb her vails and cries...beam of light was nowhere...darkness had taken over the glow and shine of hope and lightening from her life...she felt miserable........ but suddenly a realization struck..""Therz always light behind every dark nite""....and so definitely somehow , someday the shadows of the dark will be taken over by all the brightness and joy this life has to offer her...some day the strands with b let loose to give her the freedom to breath and radiate the smiles of happiness and contentment.This realization led her to the new dimensions of life ,now even in the blackness of mid nite she could c the far and distant sun rising above to eat up the shades of the dark sky ,announcing a better tomorrow and bringing a smile of satisfaction to her lips...she closed her eyes and just in an instant was lost into the valley of sweet dreams.

6754,3549714,"15,June,2004",2004-06-15,"    Just today only a realization struck me.........somehow I have lost track of life. Every second is passing by and i have just stopped worrying ab8 the preciousness of every instance that i am losing.The sand of time is just slipping out of my fingers giving me the insight of being a looser!!! I am, what i didnt expect out of life..what i didnt want to be..but now since i am what i am then i have to give the best to what i am and make sure to c how good can i be. I need more commitment towards life, more commitment towards what i do, more seriousness in my work, in thoughtsâ€¦â€¦running away from life,from responsibilities, from realization  â€¦is not like me!!! Once certain things need to be done they are to be done with all the best that I have to offer and I need to enjoy every bit of itâ€¦.how can I just keep on convincing myself that whatever is happening is not what I want and still passing my precious days doing the sameâ€¦.either I must quit or I must end up doing betterâ€¦enjoy ur work,ur life and b the best..coz this is the key to success and success will have to come to u as ur rewardâ€¦so better get going!!!

6755,3549714,"07,June,2004",2004-06-07,"    She looked in the mirror and the image it reflected really took her by surprise...somehow it reflected a beautiful girl with sparkling eyes reflecting all the dreams and passions of tomorrow,shadows of a beautiful past....hopes of future........ahhhh!!! life was wonderful...just looking at the reflection made her shiver with excitement... She was an ordinary and plain looking girl but a very strange feeling tranformed her into a princess........ luv is beautiful  now she wanted to sing ,songs of happiness..songs of passion....even the dull colored flowers in the pot nearby, looked more bright..just like her smile..a smile that suddenly could brighten someone's day,give way to light into the darkness...even she didnt know what actually made her feel more real.....what was it that gave her the realization of the existence of a beautiful soul within her....it was  HIS LOVE  that shone thru her eyes...reflected thru her smile....and danced around her making her feel like walking on water and touching the stars.. Some say luv is bliss........a blessing that is granted to those who are special..she was a special girl with a sensitive heart that could beat for the poor ,that could cry for those who were in pain...she deserved to love and be loved!! Just his thoughts brought contentment to her heart and smiles to her lips..she was in  LOVE!! He never looked into her eyes to say that they were deep enough for him to feel like getting drowned....nor he ever parised her looks ,he never said that he loved her..or wanted her badly enough..but some feelings are strange enough just like some strange people who some how enter into our lives unknowingly..just the thoughts of them make us beam and feel wanted.She was struck by the same romantic fantasy...he was no where but every where she looked...he never was there, but the feel of his presence in her life made her feel alive..love is strange.... rite!! she never saw him,never met him ,but still every night she slept with his memories shut down behind her eyes....spent the whole nite dreaming about him......HIM!!...........who was virtually living in the computer she owned...who was a virtual existence that was always alive in her chat window when ever she logged on...who was always all ears to listen to her...to feel her,to make her life as beautiful as ever...talk about the miracles of internet....it makes u alive when u r at the verge of loosing urself as an entity..makes u feel beautiful when u start feeling that u have lost the whole beauty of ur soul and ur mind...this is the place where ur mind lives and let u b what u want to b ..let u fall in lov with whom to want to fall for...life is beautiful here.Thanks to all the virtual souls!!!!

6756,3549714,"06,June,2004",2004-06-06,"    I was on my way to work today..where i saw a young pregnant woman running after cars asking for money..she was begging!! That was the instant in my life where i realized how cruel and inhuman this society has become...That woman is at the verge of a new stage..ready to welcome a new life...future of this society!!!a life that deserves all the better things like love and respect...and c what the woman has to offer to that new ray of hope......she is all set to bring that life into the world and teach him/her how to beg...how to lie...how to rob...how to kill one's prestige and cry for help..how to run away from respectable work and look for easy money..how to ask for money and from whom...these r the lessons that the child is gonna get from the mother who has an eye for the rich...has a nack of begging expertly... I am not blaming that woman...its not her fault..who knows what led her to this stage..was it poverty? was it desperation?was it illness? or was it her hubby running after her with a big stick threatening to kill her if she wont come back home with enough money for him to buy his Cigarettes...what was it that led her do it..will remain unknown to me atleast who just crossed that womens path unknowingly just by chance..but still just on looking at her many questions arose in my mind...... Every day we talk ab8 moving towards development...towards betterment..spend our lives reading bks...talking highly ab8 the days to come, a bright future..but the question is are we ready yet to face TOMORROW?.....are we prepared enough to offer our next generation a better life?....next generation.... The child of a beggar will learn to beg..will never know what a SCHOOL is, will never know what self respect is,will never know how to repect others...will only know how to beg coz that is the lesson his mother is giving him even from before his birth... i wonder, where lov has gone........lov for poor.....lov for humans..lov for children...lov for our nation... If this is the way we keep on treating with the generations to come..we are being crual to ourselves...as a nation..and as humans. God knows where lov has gone.....but it needs to be brought back for a better tomorrow..for our generations to come..so that they may have there share of love and respect which they may spread to the whole world in return and represent pakistan.

The day started as a normal bright, sunny day...no one had a slight idea that its going to end up as deady as possible..... It was time for ISHA prayers,all the mosque's cried a voice of calling from God those who could hear it went straight ahead to say there prayers...the prayers started with the name of God!!............and then there was a loud BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANG!!!a loud noise that shook the building of the MOSQUE...all the lights suddenly went into darkness.......darkness that was frightening......that was killing......has something happened??.......was it a tremor??an earthquake??.........did the earth shake?........is the sky preparing to explode!! has the sky fallen down??....what was it????????....... IT WAS A BOMB BLAST!!! ............where?? in the MOSQUE!!....uhhhhh....how many people died?.....1 ...........2.........no its 12!!......ohhhh it's 15.......eventually its 20.......and hundreds hurt ..wounded badly........   the BOMB exploded in the mosque just when the prayer started!!!!    Death took over the city that was known for its brightness and life!!.......death of innocent people..cries of there loved ones....whispers of anger and hatred and protest are all over the place now.....insecurity is all over.......prayers are left unanswered or what...??? The darkness was deadly........there was blood all over the place...those who had gone to pray were killed for reasons unknown....or may b for being The faithful!!! Death took over the city..........questions that rose in the minds of people was....WHY??why were these innocent people killed.......why did they deserve to have a death like this......why were they chosen to die in that manner.......but who has the answers?? KARACHI, once had peace and happiness reflecting thru the lights sparkling out of the eyes of its people......and now those sparkles have been replaced by fear...fear of death.....fear of being burnt alive....when will this massacre end?.....when will the common man be safe enough in the city to dream of a healthy and safe life...........When will a common man look forward to a safe and secure day for  himself and his children.........who has the answers?? when death takes over...LIFE RESIGNS!!! life has always been playing hide and seek with death, sometimes its life that wins and other r the times when death takes over but now is the time when  LIFE HAS RESIGNED ...........it has been loosing enough to continue with the battle......when today in the mosque a small child lost her father,  life lost a battle  .......when an 18 year old in the mosque was desperately trying to breath but failed .. it was life again that failed ......life lost when a young energetic Doctor was burnt alive in the mosque leaving behind a beautiful wife having all the hopes of a happy life ahead ....it wasnt the Dr that died it was life that lost again......and now its time! life has resigned..and death has taken over the city KARACHI......once known to b the city of lights!!!........ when death reigns....... fear mounts and insecurity is the order of the day........

Standing at the end of a long queue with a waiting status is killingâ€¦ We all are somehow or the other in a waiting phaseâ€¦waiting for hard times to endâ€¦waiting for another day to start, waiting for the sun to set and give way to a peaceful night. Waiting for all the struggles of life to end, waiting for a better tomorrowâ€¦!!! Like the whole world out there I am standing in the same queue since ages, the strange part is that the queue keeps on growing delaying my turn to attain my share of happiness and this time the queue is lined up in front of Gods distribution cell. Theirs a fear that keeps on haunting me, what if when after standing in this wait queue for so long when my turn comes up and I reach the window of Godâ€™s distribution cell of â€œhappinessâ€â€¦â€¦.what if I find a label there â€œ store out of stock â€“ CLOSED!!!â€    Plz God!!

19697,3556371,"26,June,2004",2004-06-26,"   I have nothing to do while my cd's burning, so I'm going to write my second blog today. Let's talk about theme park rides. I like coasters. They're all like 'whooooooooooo!' I went on my first loop today. It was scary, and I've got fucking bad whiplash, but I'm Ok. I think. Hell's Gate is so scary, you get in this big tube thing and you spin and turn and oh shit, it's scary! Oh shit, that's the name of one of my 3 cactai, Ouch, Arrrgh! and Oh Shit! I named them after what I said after touching their spikes for the first time. They like to soak up the sun in my room. Ah bless...........Ouch! Arrgh! Oh Shit! It was dark once and I went through my room, almost tripped on the crap on the floor and landed on them. I mainly got Arrrgh!ed, as he (or she)'s the tallest. Ouch is a normal castus, tall and straight (Like me :) ) Arrgh is taller than Ouch and his (or her) spikes are surrounded with soft fluff. Oh Shit is a big yellow flower with killer inch-long spikes hidden underneath (you can imagine why I said 'Oh Shit'). I don't favor any of them anymore than any other flower or plant, but I love them, awwww......Ouch! Arrgh! Oh, Shit!   "

And the atmosphere's always cold and dark, like someone's just died. It's weird; apart from Tuesday (The day when it suddenly dawns on you that you've got the whole week to go: Monday's just 'Ug' day.), Sunday's my least favorite day, yet I was born on a Sunday. Ironic. I was actually due on Friday the 13th, but I was 2 days late. I've only had 2hrs sleep in over 48 hours, and I'm slipping off now. Must........finish.......blog..............

16515,3558648,"17,June,2004",2004-06-17,"    I work in IT support.  Sometimes users are just plain dumb.  We got this message this morning:    The information below has been verified by the police as happening in NOTTINGHAMSHIRE at the moment.     POLICE WARNING - One of the officers who works with the Dare programme has passed along the following warning and asked that it be shared with all drivers.  THIS IS AN EXTREMELY SERIOUS MATTER  If you are driving after dark and you see a car without its headlights on DO NOT FLASH YOUR LIGHTS! DO NOT BLOW YOUR HORN OR MAKE ANY SIGNALS TO THE DRIVER OF THE OTHER CAR.  There is a new common gang initiation 'game' going on the streets. The new member being initiated, drives along without his headlights on until someone notices and flashes their headlights or makes some sort of other action to signal him. The gang member is now required to CHASE THE CAR AND SHOOT AT OR INTO THE CAR IN ORDER TO COMPLETE HIS INITIATION REQUIREMENTS.  Make sure you share this information with your family, friends and anyone else you can reach. If you have any questions or information, please call your local police department.  PLEASE TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY. THIS IS NOT A JOKE. PLEASE PASS THIS ON TO EVERYONE YOU KNOW ON E-MAIL AND IN PERSON. IT COULD SAVE SOMEONE'S LIFE!   Now anyone with half a brain will immediately spot that this is a hoax.  In fact it's been going around by e-mail since 1993.  It's even been in the movie 'Urban Legend' (the clue's in the name).  Some user I've never heard off took it on himself to send it to EVERYONE in the address book.  Duh.  This wouldn't be so bad if, later this afternoon, yet ANOTHER copy came from another user telling us the self same thing.  Apparently it's OK as the information had been verified by police in Nottinghamshire.  WHAT..SO YOU RANG THEM TO CHECK DID YOU?  NO?  DIDN'T THINK SO!!  DID YOU CHECK ON THE NET TO SEE IF IT WAS FOR REAL?  NO?  SO WHY THE *@#$ DID YOU MAIL EVERYONE REGARDLESS!!!!  muppets  Anyway, I've decided to start my own chain letter as retaliation.  ""Goverment scientists have discovered that a chemical produced by the human body has been found to cause diseases such as Alzheimers, Parkinsons and cancer.  However, the chemical is only found in people with GINGER hair.  Consequently an emergency edict has been issued that makes it compulsory for all people with GINGER hair to report to special decontamination camps.  This has been verified by the second cousin of the brother-in-law of the woman who does the ironing for the Secretary of State for Health.    DO NOT IGNORE THIS.   YOUR LIFE COULD BE IN DANGER.   SEND IT TO EVERYONE IN YOU ADDRESS BOOK.   NOW!   WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR!!""   "
16516,3558648,"13,June,2004",2004-06-13,"    Actually it's not chilly at all, it's just that I went to see 'The Day After Tomorrow' at the flicks last night.  Now I know that some critics have been giving the film a hard time, mostly on the basis that the science is somewhat unrealistic with regard to timescales.  What critics seem to forget is that WE DON'T CARE...IT'S JUST A FILM!!!!  So the cataclysmic events that unfolded were sped up a wee bit (OK, probably more than a wee bit), but it wouldn't have been much of a disaster movie otherwise would it?  Take the 'realistic' scenario:  Heroic scientist goes before a global warming commission with predictions of dire consequences.  Cut to end of film, 60 years later with same herioc scientist, now around 100 years old, waving his zimmer frame at the equally geriatric commission shouting ""I bloody told you so!""  Hardly gripping stuff.  Same thing applies to the big catastrophe scenes - I wouldn't have been the same if all you go was a bunch of folks at the beach going ""Y'know..I reckon this water is a couple of inches deeper than it was 20 years ago"".  Still, the film is quite critical of the US stance on global warming (good on 'em), so it was quite something for a big studio to bring it out.  It was probably given the green light on the basis that the Canadians get it first and worse ;-)  So that's most of the big blockbusters seen for the year so far - Harry Potter 3, Day After Tomorrow etc.  I'm just waiting for Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow, plus possibly Hellboy.  Then it's Alien vs Predator in the autumn!   "
16517,3558648,"13,June,2004",2004-06-13,"    In case anyone is interested, this is the type of bike I have.  It's a Suzuki GSF400V - the V means it has all that Variable Valve Timing Stuff.  Bottom line..pulls like a train from 8000 rpm.   "
16518,3558648,"09,June,2004",2004-06-09,"    It makes you wonder, there's not really a lot to do on a Sunday apart from watch sport on TV.  And today was a full one.  There was bike racing (Superbikes AND MotoGP), Car Racing (LeMans 24hr and Canadian GP) and footie.  The GP was as predictable as it was dull.  Dear old Schumi cleared off and ""von der race in ein most efficient manner, ja?"".  Started from 6th, finished 1st - yet overtook absolutely no-one in the race.  BOORRRRIIINNNGGG.  The entire thing is being dictated in the pits.  They ought to go back and make everyone run the whole race on a single set of tyres and fuel load.  That'd slow the cars down too and actually make people try and overtake each other.  That and the fact that Bernie Ecclestone would rather have a season full of tracks that pay him loads of dosh rather than tracks that have good races (see under ""Belgian Grand Prix"" for details).  My advice?  Watch motorcycle racing instead.  Or maybe lawn green bowling.  Disappointed by the footy - 1-0 up with 90 minutes gone and then lose 2-1 in injury time.  Bugger.  Flippin' French.  Apart from televised sport it's been the usual type of day - ironing stuff for work (slightly less boring that the GP), odd jobs (like oiling the fuel filler cap on my Suzuki because I couldn't get it open to put more petrol in..always a bit of a problem that) and trying to persuade the cat that the fat little grey bowling ball shape is not quite as 'de riguer' amongst other felines as she thinks and, no, she doesn't need ANOTHER packet of cat food.

16519,3558648,"09,June,2004",2004-06-09,"    Jeesos it's been hot out.  Over 30 degrees.  I'm going off to hide in our lovely air-conditioned data centre in a minute.  I think Russ Abbott had the name for it - Betty Swollocks.  It was too darn warm at badminton the other night too - sweating like a pig within minutes.  So dehydrated by the end of 2 hours that I could barely move my limbs.   Funniest news story of the day - Metallica's drummer (Lars) has been taken ill just days before the band headline the Download festival here in the UK.  Rather than pull out and disappoint their fans the band have 'borrowed' a drummer from one of the other bands on the bill - Dave from Slayer..  That has left Slayer short one drummer, so they've borrowed Joey from Slipknot and Sal from Life of Agony to fill in on their set.  Presumably these 2 guys will do their own band's set too.  Talk about musical drumstools!   Did I mention is was hot out?  Yuk sticky.  I've got a new toy - Creative Zen Xtra MP3 jukebox with 60 (that's SIXTY) gigs of storage (take note Apple with your meagre 40 gig iPods).  Got it from a guy on eBay.  Not that I have an eBay habit.

16520,3558648,"07,June,2004",2004-06-07,"    What a morning.  Monday morning at work, never at my best.  I'm usually fully awake somewhere around Tuesday lunchtime.  Anyway, puncture duly fixed and bike working again so I stagger into work at the crack of 9.30.  Spent a chunk of the morning trying to fix an error where our users can't connect to one of our partner locations.  Looks like asymmetric routing loop.  Look it up.  The rest of the day is meetings.  Lots of them, all short and no free grub.  Bum.  Get to prove how unfit I am tonight by attempting to play badminton.  Should get done by 8 when it's the series finale of the latest Star Trek series - yay!  As long of course as those d*cks at NTL don't screw up the TV again.  I was watching the box last night when my entire cable TV service died at about 8.45, just before the last Hell's Kitchen.  So I had to run around and reconnect my terrestial TV aerial so I could get a picture on ITV1.  It wasn't fixed when I went to sleep at 1am but it was OK this morning.  Here's hoping.  What ticked me off the most is that there is NO FAULT HANDLING WHATSOEVER on a Sunday from NTL.  You pay fora 24/7 service and you get 12/6 support.  Useless.  Rant over.  SYL   "

6105,3558845,"12,June,2004",2004-06-12,"    i have alot to talk about.  i actually have the afternoon alone, and i'm welcoming it with open arms.    i'm going to be completely honest with you.  i hope you can appreciate that, and not fly off the handle over the first couple of paragraphs.  i have alot more to say after that.  dan and i have been together for about six weeks.  i was afraid to tell you for one very important reason--i didn't want to get a phone call in the middle of the night saying that you had done something to yourself.  i'm still going to be afraid of that.  but now i'm going to have to trust God to take care of you.  you asked me if i was in love with dan and i said no.  i wasn't exactly lying.  i'm just not sure.  i definitely love him, and i'm happy being around him, but i'm not sure if i'm in love or not.  we have pretty much the same conversations every day--which are about you.  honestly, he's not happy about my interaction with you.  you can see why now.  he has alot of insecurity and stress about that, and it's affecting our relationship.  i told him last night that, either way, i would lose a friend.  because of his decision not to be around you (which he still stands by, and i have to respect that), if i chose you, i would lose him.  if i chose to stay with him, then i would feel bad for not respecting his wishes, and i would lose you.  i feel trapped and very stressed out.  there is alot of love there, but dan and i have not had the picture-perfect relationship so far.  it's really weird--while i crave solitude above anything else right now, i'm afraid to be alone.  i don't depend on you or on dan for my happiness, but i'm still scared.  dan is constantly reading my face and asking me what i'm thinking, and most of the time i don't want to tell him.  i just want to think and keep it to myself.  but when i say 'nothing' he automatically thinks that i'm thinking about you.  then he gets sad and even more stressed out.  and that, in turn, does the same thing to me.  it's a vicious cycle.  what stresses me out is the promises i made to you that you've brought up.  i promised when we broke up that i would welcome you back with open arms.  trust me, i did not see everything coming that has happened--dan falling in love with me, your reactions, my feelings toward them--none of it.  that doesn't mean that i'm trying to release myself from my promise.  i've cried on way more than one occasion over it.  i promised you that i would never turn my back on you and that i would always be here for you.  i cry every time i think about that.  i'm crying now.  because i feel trapped and that any decision i make will end up hurting someone so much.  i've been allowing dan to love me and take care of me, so in a sense i feel guilty because i feel like i replaced you too soon.  i know you're probably thinking about that, too, and hurting.  i'm so sorry.  before you and i were together, i always looked at dan and saw someone that i could be perfectly happy with for the rest of my life.  he was confident, straight-forward, secure with himself, and had his priorities in order.  he also knew exactly what he was looking for and didn't depend on anyone else for his happiness.  all of this is what was going through my head the night he told me that he loved me (along with shock).  i'm afraid that everything that's happened has made him different.  i never saw him afraid before.  never saw insecurity in him.  i'm afraid that it's made him a different person, and i'm afraid that he's relying on me too much for his happiness.  he watches me all the time.  he watches my face, and if it changes, even if i'm not thinking about anything important, he gets worked up because he thinks i'm upset or that i'm thinking about you.  and when i try to talk to him about some of these things, he gets defensive.  so i don't know what's going to happen.  but, just for clarification, we are in no way, shape, or form sleeping together.  dan will stay a virgin as long as he's with me, until he gets married.  i don't know what else to say.  i hope that i've made the right decision in telling you all of this.  i felt the same way dan did--he felt like he was lying to you by not telling you.  he was just alot braver than me and told you a long time ago how he felt.  he's worried about me telling you this because he's scared that i'm going to get the same reaction from you that he got.  i personally think that i trust you more than that.  i know you won't ever physically hurt me.  but i've told the absolute truth now.  i'm not hiding anything, but i hope this blog stays between me and you.  if you need to talk about this some more, we can.    i just feel like i'm not going to be able to make anyone happy.  on one side i have you telling me how you feel and that hopefully we'll be able to get back together, and on the other side i have dan accusing me of never being able to let you go and telling me to move on.  i feel so trapped.  as far as me and you....i don't know.  i miss you alot.  i love you, and the idea of you lying in bed and crying and trying so hard to get me back and hurting so much hurts me more than you can imagine.  but i don't know how close i can be to you right now because i honestly don't know what i want from you.  and i don't want to encourage you and give you hope and then realize that it's never going to work out.  i don't want to hurt you any more than i already have.  the idea of not being able to be there to comfort you at night hurts me.  especially when i have someone with me.  i'll admit it's probably because you're stronger than me.  what i'm sorrier for more than anything is that my weakness caused you pain.  please forgive me for that.  i just don't know what to do.  but i want you to know that you're not the only one hurting and crying.  someone else is sharing that with you.  even though i have someone with me, it's not someone who can completely understand....it makes me feel very alone.  the only one who can understand is you.  please continue to pray for me, and please be patient.  i love you, and i miss you.

6106,3558845,"12,June,2004",2004-06-12,"    i'm finding it easier to post a new entry on my own blog than to post alot of comments on yours.  i hope you don't mind.  i'm sorry you couldn't sleep last night.  i went to bed really early and actually got plenty of sleep.  hopefully you fell asleep and you'll get pleny of sleep before work.  i hope you make alot of money tonight, too.  i turned in all my health insurance stuff yesterday and went on a little cleaning frenzy around my house.  gave me a little sense of accomplishment.  i had a really good food-running shift last night, too.  i have the weekend off and my bar and wine class on monday.  take my last test on tuesday and hopefully be on the floor on my own by tuesday night.    ""For God has not given us a spirit of fearfulness, but one of power, love, and sound judgement.""           ~2 Tim. 1:7  i read that yesterday and thought of you and dan both.  i can't think of anything else i really need to talk about at the moment....i'm sure i'll post again later.   "
6107,3558845,"11,June,2004",2004-06-11,"    wow.  haven't done this in a long time.  since last summer, anyway.  and we both know how that ended up.  so you're the only one who's gonna know this address.    first of all, i just wanted to let you know that this isn't always going to be a serious blog.  half the reason i wanted to start this was for me--to remind myself of things that i want to personally accomplish.  it isn't always going to be about you--when it is, you'll know.  but you won't always know what i'm talking about, since i intend to write about pretty much everything that's on my mind and everything that's happened to me.  i started thinking today about how much i needed to get my life back together.....just little things that i've been putting off because i haven't taken any time to myself.  i started trying to fix that situation by cleaning house today.  speaking of which, i finally had to throw my flowers away.  they had just about had it.  there are so many other little things i need to do--i need to stop by the financial aid office at letourneau and talk to jennifer about starting to pay back some of my loans. (i mean, all i need is another monthly bill, right?).  i need to finish studying for my marketing and finance finals so i can take them and be done with that.  all these tests at carino's are taking up so much time.  and i'm really missing my parkeway membership.  truthfully, i'm missing outback.  i don't like the people at carino's at all.  people down there ask me how i like it so far, and i have to hesitate and plan my words before i answer them.  i just wish i could get my life back to normal.  i didn't miss waiting tables at all during the last two weeks when i didn't have a job, but i hate having to stress about not having my own money.  i hate depending on someone else to take care of me.  i know dan didn't mind helping me at all and he would do it again in a heartbeat, but i hate feeling like i've lost my independence.  i'm irritated because at the rate carino's is going, it'll be next tuesday or wednesday before i'm on the floor by myself, and it's getting to be time for bills to start showing up again.  grrrrr...  i also started thinking about something you had mentioned in one of your posts....it was something i told you first.  if you love something very much, let it go.  if it doesn't come back to you, it was never yours to begin with.  if it does come back to you, it's yours forever.  i've been encouraging you to let go so things can get better and we can live our own lives seperately, when i'm the one who's having trouble letting go.  i want to apologize for that.  i understand now what you meant when you told me that i was selfish.  i'm so scared of letting you go because you're such a big part of my life and because i'm scared of what my life would be like if you weren't in it.  you've been my best friend for a long time.  i don't want to lose you, but at the same time i know we can't be together because i know we wouldn't be happy.  i just don't know what to do.  i guess i'm just scared and selfish and i need to grow up.  hopefully telling you all of this is the first step, because i've been terrified of telling you what's really on my heart.  i'm scared of your reactions.  the thought of you being sad or upset or depressed and knowing i'm the cause of it hurts me more than i know how to handle.  i absolutely hate the idea of hurting anyone.  but you told me once that you would rather i tell you the truth, and that you wished that my unwillingness to hurt you wasn't a factor, so i'm trying to give up my way of doing things (which has been a failure and hurt more than one person) and focus on your way of doing things.  i also know that i haven't focused on God enough, and that i haven't been trusting Him to take care of you or dan or myself, for that matter.  i'm going to focus more on trying to change that.  it's all part of the healing process, i guess.  it's a hard thing to accept that none of this (including your feelings and dan's feelings) is in my control.  i'm going to have to focus more on trusting God and doing what He wants me to do.    right now i think he wants me to focus on laundry.  so i better go, since my work clothes are in there.  i have my food running shift tonight, and then i have to come home and start studying for my bar test.  i'm so happy for you right now.  i'm so glad that sam did what he did....it really was an answer to prayer.

20961,3558872,"09,June,2004",2004-06-09,"    My neat son just called me from DC to hear the horses hooves as the processional carrying President Reagan's body went past.  It was strange because I was watching it on TV and they were going up a tree-lined path at the Capitol Bldg.  When I called Steve back, he told me he was under the trees, away from the crowds.  He's off to get in line for the viewing.  What tales he'll be able to tell is grandchildren!   "
20962,3558872,"07,June,2004",2004-06-07,    I am sad over the loss of President Reagan.  I believe he was just one of us who went on to change the world.  I wish only the best for his family.  I pray they may get through this sad time and know that the nation truly loved and appreciated him.

20964,3558872,"20,July,2004",2004-07-20,"    Never paint your living room because it's never as simple as that.&nbsp; This past spring I decided to paint the grungy, fireplace smudged walls in my living room.&nbsp; So once summer came, and I had time to actually paint, I proceeded to my nearby paint store and brought home the pre-requisite 55 paint sample sticks.&nbsp; Needless to say, I could not decide which color to use, so my mother suggested I call a designer who could come up with a plan for my living space that I could work toward in order to have the Martha Stewart room.&nbsp; I met with Donielle and she said a plan would be ready within a week.&nbsp;&nbsp; Well,&nbsp;I needed to paint the walls, but Donielle was still planning my room, so I called her twice and finally pinned her down on a color , which turned out to be a two color, ragged-on paint application in my lovely large 25 X 14 room.&nbsp; I worried and fretted over this two step process, until my sister finally showed me how this was not brain surgery and I could always re-do anything I messed up, so one week later my walls look great, but unfortunately, this aggravated my carpal tunnel symptoms, so now I'm looking at surgery sometime in August.&nbsp; Anyhow, back to the living room,&nbsp;&nbsp;I have now waited four weeks, and have no plan from Donielle, BUT my mother suggested I change the carpet to a lovely green.&nbsp; I did, and she was right!&nbsp; And not because she is always right, but this time she is actually right.&nbsp; Because the carpet is green and the walls are a darker shade than before, I need to change the curtains, and buy a new beige leather chair, as the blue stuffed chair I have is too dark, add a ficus tree in the corner, and order an upholstered bench for under the window.&nbsp; Oh, and because the living room is&nbsp; connected to the kitchen, I'll need to change the wallpaper in there, because it has no green.&nbsp; When I moved the furniture into the kitchen to have the carpet installed, my linoleum stretched, so now I need new.&nbsp; I'm thinking a wood laminate might be nice.&nbsp; Also, my foyer now seems too light, so I'll probably have to hire a painter to paint it since I cannot reach up into the stairwell to paint.&nbsp; So, like I said, never paint your living room.

24144,3558898,"10,June,2004",2004-06-10,"   People are crazy or they are stupid, or something, it's very strange.  When I stay home, and i watch the TV or I take a shower, I always dream ""wow, how good will be now if I would be on a mountain, with flours around me, not any car sound, not smoke, not any strange noise from the neighborhood, just the birds and the plants"". And when I'm up there in the top of the world on the mountain, I think ""why? why I camed here? bugs everywhere, I don't have where to take a shower, I don't have anything to do, I just get bored, not a TV, not nothing, I should stay home next time when I wana go on a mointain"".  And ofcourse, when I'm home the same thing it's happening, and when I'm on a mountain the same thing. Why we are like that? We will never get the answer.  "

I'm not. Why? Dunno why, I just want to get lazy and not to do anything. Curios, huh? Sometimes I ask my self why God made us like we are. Eating, going to toilet, drinking if we are tursty, sleeping, and so one. It's a strange world and some strange people too.  "
24146,3558898,"08,June,2004",2004-06-08,"   Yes, it was a hard day, because my boss was out of town (you could all say: yupeeeeeeee!!!). No, it's not like that, because when my boss it's out of town I have to do his work and I can't miss from work, and alot of thing.  All the day I was very depressed, something in the morning made me to think at what is the meaning of life. And I didn't found out, a part from my depression is because I don't have a girlfriend., but I'm not in the mood to explain what I thought and what not. This subject I let it for another day.  Ah, by the way, today I had the first comment to my blog :), from somebody called Ron, Thanks Ron :), it's nice to know cuz somebody is visiting your blog once in a while.  Ok, I will close the post for today, because it's showtime and because I'm just not in the mood, the OZ it's begining :). A movie with a jail :)  Good Night  "

Because is the first day to work, and ofcourse because it's monday. Monday I work more like the whole week. Yep, monday, the day when another week of work is coming. Do you have that feeling ""of monday"" in anothers day? I have that. It's not a nice feeling, a nice feeling is ""of friday"" or ""of saturday"". The feeling ""of sunday"" i don't like that either, because after sunday comes monday, and again, yep it's monday :(.  At work I have a great Boss, yep it's great because he consider me his boss, not him my boss, but he talks alot, and when I mean alot, I mean alot, and he talks about things what I don't care, because he is old, I think he has over 70, and i'm just 26, what I could hear from him, everytime when I have a little break, I run from my work to stay 15 - 30 minutes with some friends, who are working at 2 minutes from me, two brothers, one works 3 days after that the other one works 3 day, and with them I can talk about what I want, and about what I'm interested.  I wait everyday to get out from work, to come online to make what I like the most, surfing :). Surfing nowhere, just I open the google and I search and I search and so one. I stay 2 or 3 hr, after that I go home at my computer and I work at my webpage, at some designs. I look at the time, and wow, it is begining the tv shows, I watch like 3 hr and after that I go to sleep.  I will go a little too surf some more, and after that go home. Why?

I was born in Poland, and now I'm 15 years old, my life was going just find until I came to Portugal with my family in for holiday. The first couple of days I did nothing but sitting in the apartment my dad had rented and fighting with my brother or sister. After few days my dad took us to the ocean. I thought Portugal had a wonderful view from the coast, with a splendid sunset far away in the middle of the ocean... But I was wrong. The beach was dirty with hundreds of broken clams, the sand was dirty and smelled like few thousands of rotten fish swimming in sewer instead of ocean. This was the first four days from our ""trip"". Few days later I went to the beach once more, I was nine years by then, this time we went without my dad. My mom allowed me to go take a bath because a friend of my dad was there with us and she though he would help if something would happen to us, she was wrong... It didn't took long before the ocean ""sucked"" me into a much distant area, the man who was supposed take care of me had the same problem (I think) and swimmed to the beach. After few whiles I saw my mom swimming towards me, but the waves increased and turned things much worst. After few whiles I reached my mother and we tried to come back to beach, unluckily something seemed to be pushing her down under the water, I tried to reach her for few seconds but I hadn't a good pulmonary capacity, so I had to go back to the surface. When I submerged once more I did'n saw my mom.  When I understood I wasn't strong enough to help her I swam few meters near the quay, I grabbed two rocks and waited a while looking for a path to swim to the quay. Finally I got out of the water and I realized I was all in slashes made by clams and stones. Finally on the beach I saw my mom lying on the sand, surrounded by medics.  Later that day my father called me, my brother and my sister into his room. He told us that our mom was dead during the transport to the hospital. I think this were the saddest days of my life :(  "

16959,3569188,"07,June,2004",2004-06-07,"   Alirght, so today sucked. Biug deal. I have never really gotten excited about Birthdays. I am really disappointed in Erika. I figure I am just not gonna bring it up, so she will eventually realized it's passed, and feel awful. I don't know, aren't I mean? I don't care. So anyway, tonight I am going to completely organize my closet and room and get rid of everything I don't need. Yikes..I am such a packrat that this is gonna be hard. I'll get it done somebow. Once that is accomplished, I plan on designing a new blog or site layout. I don't know which one I want to do right now, but most likely it'll be the site. I am going to do a black/red/pink theme- you know, eventual color fading and stuff. It should be cool.   I need to start working on the violin. I had so many summer goals, I just need to start breaking up the time of summer and start planning everything out. I am going to bed early tonight so that I can get up early and go running. It's gonna be a good summer if I can keep myself busy. I admit- I am still hung up on Corey. I feel bad about Nate. I mean, I used him in a way to try to distrat myself. But I don't know..it's just that I have this wierd spot for Corey in my heart as a friend and that seems to be affecting the way I still feel about him. One of the most dragged out crushes ever. I'll get over it. Just need to keep distracted. Grr, I am so angry at myself for becoming attatched at all. I mean, it was one year and I've already let 2 people in. THat's two more than I would prefer. I don't like it..I have good reason too. What's the point of letting people get close to you if you are only gonna get hurt. That's why it's casual dating and superficial teenage relationships for me next year, thanks. Whatever. I need to have more of an open heart. I mean, the problem I have is that it's so big and gullible. I hope nobody ever finds out how to work me. If they can get that close :-P. Not gonna happen.  So anyway, I need to drink more water, I am totally dehydrated. Still mad at Erika a little. I don't know why I get so annoyed with this, but I don't know. Wish me luck with running in the morning...it'll be torture. ;-)  "

16961,3569188,"06,June,2004",2004-06-06,"   Alright..so it's not 'neglection' parse, but it'll do justice to describe how I am feeling. Erika totally forgot my Birthday! I mean, she went to the beach with Stori, and then she's going off to celebrate Stori's B-Day later. Grr to her. Anyhoo..  Corey remembered. He would though..he knows what it's like to not have anyone remember. So far today, I have pretty much wasted the day. I watched Charlie's Angels; Full Throttle (which is so completely gay), then I cleaned, and then that's pretty much it besides the internet. Total waste. I think I might clean out my closet later...fascinating experiences for a fascinating Birthday. Whatever. Well, write later maybe.  "
16962,3569188,"06,June,2004",2004-06-06,"   I am really tired. Uggh. I just transferred all of my entries from ebloggy.com to here. Not many, so it wasn't that bad. Tomorrow is monday..I am supposed to go running and start putting my nose to the grindstone (grindstone?or is it grind your nose to the stone? or to the limestone...???) well, whatever. Anyhoo...(been saying that word a lot lately) Tomorrow I think I might call Mary. Don't know. I still can't believe that it's summer. It's not hot enough yet. Guess I just haven't gotten into my routine..well tomorrow's my chance.   Tomorrow is my birthday. In about 8 mins I will be 14. Well, not technically until like, 4 in the afternoon, but poo on technicallity. Omg, I just said the word poo...I really am losing it. Whatever...(been saying that word a lot too..hmm..). I am gonna wait and see if anybody remembers my birthday tomorrow..I doubt it. Nobody really cares. Erika might remember, but I don't care if she does. To be honest, I kind of want people to forget so I can blame them. That's so mean, but I guess it's just me. I don't know, I am trying to figure out who I  really  am, but what if I don't like that person? I most likely will, seeing how I surround myself with people like me..I don't know.   Corey's still on my mind..deciding whether or not it would be a good thing to see him much this summer. I don't know...I mean, I don't want to get any closer to him. I am already freaking out with the way things are. I mean, it's like I just break down around him and I don't hold anything in! Isn't there something completely messed up with that? I don't know, I just don't like people to know me...I feel limited and they form their own assumptions and I am no longer free to be just me, which is dually hard when I don't know who 'me' is. Anyhoo..I don't know. It's like he has this wierd control over me. I can't put my finger on it right now..maybe later. But I mean, I dont' really get mad at him, and if I do (which has happened like, twice) It's just because I want to be, and because I am really stupid. Grrr to you COrey Shotwell! I guess I will just have to deal with it. (Feel more sorry for him- he's got the end wehre he has to listen to me complain and whine :-P).   Well, it's 11:59 on the computer clock. Waiting...   12! Well, I am unofficially 14 years old. Omg..that's really wierd..anyway. Got to get to bed and stuff. Write later..most likely tomorrow.   -lyss-  "
16963,3569188,"06,June,2004",2004-06-06,"   So bored today. Went to my baptism class, came back and took quizzes. Erika and I went to the park. We climbed over the stupid fence that's like, 8 feet tall, and Erika was afraid to jump about 2ft from the trash can to the ground. She's not a very good partner in crime, but as Corey isn't here (and even if he was, he wouldn't do anything cause he's such a wimp about breaking rules) she's good enough. So I get inside and we decide it would be funny to put an orange cone on top of the shed...I don't know  why , but hey, come on- it's summer and we were super-bored. So it's up there and I am like, ok, that's waaay too noticable, so I try to step down, except Erika wasn't paying attention and forgot to sturdy the bin I was standing on. So I like, fall and this brick thingy lands on my leg and Erika starts laughing hysterically. So we are sitting there- cone on the roof, me being physically impared, and Erika making a ton of noise. So I am sitting there and going, ""SHHHHH! ERIKA, shut up!"" and then I was freaking out about the cone in case somebody saw it, and then Erika tries to hit it down with a mop and I am still stuck in the bricks, and then the crappy stuff is falling off the mop onto my face and we are freaking out. So eventually we fixed the situation, and we went back home.......to get tools. :-P   So we come home, get two phillips screw drivers, a monkey wrench, a hammer, and wire cutters. Instead of going in depth to all of our little 'adventures', heres a list:   -unhinging a shed door to see what's inside (i got bored and only followed half way through)  -carving initials into shed  -erika carving initials of who she likes into tree (not so bad)  -me puncturing the school's hose (hey, it's our tax money! and besides, Erika told me...:-P)  -Carving my initials into a fence  -both erika and I slashing 'z's into the screens (zorro theme!)

16965,3569188,"05,June,2004",2004-06-05,"   I'm sitting here, crying over the keyboard. I don't know what I am going to do. I just feel like- nothing. I feel empty and I feel lonely, and I feel completely unloved. I hate life. I sometimes feel like everyone else's life would have just been better if i hadn't been born, or if I died. It's so pathetic though...of course people would be sad. Very few though.   I just want somebody to hold on to, who can tell me everything is going to be alright, and I don't have that. School is out, the only friends I see are Corey and Erika...My mom hates me, my dad is completely horrible, and my sister hates me like she always has. Kevin hates me...I think that a few people in school liked me, but school is out and I don't know who to turn to.  Erika is really pathetic. She has to have everything her own way, and she is the center of the universe. Anyone who declares otherwise, should run for his life. I mean, I just hate her. And it's real. I mean, I just don't like her at all, and I wish she would die. Watch, tomorrow I will be all- I love Erika, but from now on...I don't know.  I hate me! Why the hell is everything so messed up. We were talking and Erika had brought up something about Corey and me being a pushover. She says that I am stubborn and I always have to argue and stand up to people and then I claimed that I didn't- for example Corey. And she said that he's got control over me, and I realized that she's right. I don't know why...I mean, it's like Corey's a special case...and with me, that's definitely something when it comes to me standing up for myself. Why do I let anybody have that control over me? I just can't let him find out because it would give him complete control over me and he's too much like me already. He would work me and get what he wanted way too much...Love is blind, and I love him as a friend...but I love Erika, and yeah, I still do, yet I argue with her so much it's not even funny.  Omg...I am a weak person today. Tomorrow I am going in the pool and that's all I want to do. I would be so happy to fricken drown while swimming. It would be perfect..except I am utterly afraid of drowning. Whatever..I babble. I don't know what I am going to do with myself.  Best Friends as of This Morning:  -Corey -Kellie -Erika  I miss Kellie. She had her date with Lance last night...wonder how it went. :-) She probably wasn't paying attention for most of the movie. Whatever. Everyone loves Kellie...  Well, I am gonna go to sleep and stop dwelling on my retarded problems for a couple of hours. I love having this, I don't need to complain to people as much...  "

I guess it's dedicated to self improvement. More on that later.   I am so pissed at Erika. She is so retarded sometimes. She's annoyed that I always need the last word, and yeah, I guess that can get annoying but listen: I was arguing with my dad and I was disagreeing and attempting to get the last word subconsciously and Erika like, storms off because I was doing it. I don't even understand why she thinks that she has the right to just get all angry because I was arguing with someone else. Frankly, I don't give a crap, so whatever.   Went to PoA with Corey, Shelly, and Erika this morning. It was at the IMax and it was pretty cool. Erika and I got there early and we had to sit through this documentary about caribou. Then Shelly and Corey got there and the movie started after a little while. Once the movie started, i was a little annoyed because of the excess cuddling (corey-shelly). I mean, I can understand the hand holding and stuff, but it's just really annoying to me, and i don't know why. Erika was even more annoyed. Don't know why she even cares..anyway.   I am so bored. I can't wait until the pool is done tomorrow, I am going to go swimming! I am so excited. I got to jump in before Erika :-P. FIrst time ever...and it's my pool to begin with! Whatever. Grrr, she annoys me right now. Anyway, I guess I will stop writing...not much to do besides internet which sound completely boring. Maybe I will go for a run or something. I could play the violin...babbling now, must go.  "

13051,3572119,"08,June,2004",2004-06-08,"   i think the fact that this site is hidden gives me reason to feel like i can openly express whats going on in my life and not worry that i'm hurting someone...  summer just started, i'm excited...but at the same time kind of dissapointed because i can already see myself wasting it away.  i wish i had the motivation every second of every day to accomplish the things that i have on my 'list'. who knows maybe i will...  life right now...can be described as complicated, but when is life not? to start off i guess i should explain my relationships with people since friends and family are the main excuses for why my life is the way that it is.  family: i just had a long talk with my parents last night about responsibilities and maturity and fun stuff like that, i'm not really sure if i got anywhere but atleast i tried.  danielle and derek arn't very big problems at the moment, were all just trying to survive our own lives...  friends:  justin-  this relationship is complicated enough in itself, justin, my ex...is one of my best friends...and we still act like friends...and sometimes more.  i'm not really sure what we are, but if i find a name for it i'll let you know.  i still care about him...actually i care about him a lot, and this recent break up is still a shock to me even though i know it needed to happen.  i guess what makes this friendship complicated is the fact that i'm not really sure what justin expects or looks for in me.  i ask sometimes, but he seems to avoid the question, either intentional or not.  not that i'm assuming that he feels this way or has intended for me to suspect this but i'm worried that this [insert name of relationship here] is going to turn into some kind of dependency. not for me, but for him....i guess i'm worried that he'll get the impression that because i still love him i'll be willing to be 'there' for him whenever he wants. sounds horrible huh...and inside i really know that justin wouldn't intentionally want this to be a result of what were going through.  so thats my motivation to keep hope in the friendship but i guess i can kind of sense a forshadowing of something going wrong in the future.  its like one day we can be happy, hang out...kiss...and just be there for eachother and then the next he can push me away and make fun of me.  then the next time he wants to be a little more intimate he apologizes....its only happened a couple of times, so you would think that i have nothing to worry about.  but imagine the state i'm in right now...i was in a relationship for a year and two months and we both fell in love.  justin leaves for basic in the summer so we decide that when he leaves we would take a break....something happenes (i'm still clueless as to what) and he decides to break it off 2 months earlier...so one day we're holding hands and kissing and then the next, nothing, we, or i guess i, had to pretend like nothing ever happened and we were just friends.  i wanted to make him happy so...i went a long with it.  now after a week or so i'm kinda getting used to the idea that, justin isn't mine anymore and we start hanging out and having fun as friends, everything seemed to be going well.  so one day...justin invites me over to his house to hang out. were sitting on the couch and he invites me to lay down a snuggle him [this kind of caught me off gaurd because before this there were no intimate or flirting relations] and then the next thing i know justin is kissing me.  i'm not going to lie, i liked it, actually no i loved it, because here i am sad that i feel like i'm losing the one person i want and then here he comes wisking me off my feet.  the one thing i learned from what has happened so far was to always be realistic, and i knew deep down that justin didn't want another relationship...i mean if i was leaving in 2 months i wouldn't want to be tied down too...soo what was going on? i guess it can be summed up that we're just two really good friends who still care about eachother a lot and share some intimate moments with eachother.  the question that i'm facing myself with now is whether this kind of realtionship is what the both of us needs.  i mean for me it did kind of help with me getting over what justin and i had on a deeper level...which sounds weird but stopping our relationship earlier cold turkey for a week was hard to get through, and now that i feel like i still have a part of him with me it helps me stay with reality but also have this 'romantic dream' with the person i wish i could be with. *sigh* i just wish i knew what was going on in justins head, its nearly impossible to know, he usually resists talking about that kind of stuff...but it is kind of important. no matter how much love i have for him, i'm not going to stand by and watch myself be used...i just hope that it doesn't turn into that.  guess thats all i have time for today....i'll post more later  "
13052,3572119,"07,June,2004",2004-06-07,   summer has just started.... the warm colors emerging filling the air with the scent of freshness like the fresh feeling of a blank new piece of paper a new chapter... .a new beginning.  
12361,3576839,"14,June,2004",2004-06-14,"   In the Idaho National Guard we are often told to ""be Gumby,"" or to be incredibly flexible.  Well this last weekend we all practiced our Gumby skills once again as we packed our section equipment and our personal equipment to meet us in Fort Bliss.  The packing of the equipment is not a big deal, you pack up your duffel bags, through them in a pile, and pack up your section equipment in a big box.  My section, the Medic section, has very little in the way of equipment.  Especially when compared to other sections, such as the mechanics.  No, the true test of our Gumbiness came when we were told that rather than leaving on 1 July we were leaving on 3 July.  Why is that a problem?  What trauma could that possibly cause by telling us that we have an extra 2 days to spend with our loved ones?  There is, as so often happens, more to the story than that. Over the course of our ""2 weeks in the summer"" training we were told often and LOUDLY that if there was any information to be told, we would be among the first to know.  Essentially the leadership, specifically the commander and first sergeant, said that media was not ""in the know"" and should information become available, we would be told by our chain of command.  The media was not a good source of information as far as our deployment goes.  So, more than a week ago, the newspaper reported that the unit would be leaving on 3 July to head to Fort Bliss to start training.  We all knew that the paper couldn't be right, since that information hadn't come down to us through the proper channels.  In light of this, when one soldiers mother asked if she should get her ticket for vacation for a date after 3 July, that soldier said ""No, don't waste your vacation time just because the newspaper screwed up on the date.""  Her concern was to be able to see her son off as he flew out.  Fast forward from then to this last weekend, and on Sunday afternoon, after spending the whole weekend working with the very people that knew all of the correct details, they finally decided that it was important enough to let the rest of us in on it.   Being Gumby gets REALLY frustrating REALLY fast.  "
12362,3576839,"08,June,2004",2004-06-08,"   This is, as you can see, the first entry in what I hope will be fairly regular updates to my weblog.  It made sense to me, as I don't know how much time I will have once my unit gets activated to send out letters and/or emails to everyone that I would like to.  This will serve as a forum for people to get a glimpse into life as it unfolds throughout the deployment.  As it stands now, on 8 June, 2004, we are all anxiously waiting out Mobilization date of 1 July.  On that date my unit will move from Lewiston, Idaho to Fort Bliss, Texas.  For those of you who are not familiar with Fort Bliss (as I wasn't), it is located near El Paso, Texas, which is also very near the New Mexico border.  We will not, however, be spending much time on Fort Bliss itself.  Instead, the training sites are 60-70 miles out, and consists of three separate sites, each with a different focus.  Each site is a 10 day training circuit, with 3 days in between sites for movement to the next site and rest.  From what I understand it will be some long days.  After Fort Bliss, the unit will attend 1 of 2 training bases: Fort Irwin, California or Fort Polk, Louisiana.  I have spent time at both (4 years at Polk and 2 months at Irwin) and each has it's own ups and downs.  After spending a month training there, rumor has it that we will receive leave prior to deployment overseas to Iraq.  Spirits in the unit itself have remained pretty high, but then no one can say how that may change once the shit hits the fan, as it were.  I do have every confidence in myself and my comrades, and this training that we will be attending will only enhance that.  My section, the Medics, will even be receiving extra training for our medical skills.  That is very exciting in itself and I am looking forward to brushing up a bit.   As it stands, I do not know when things will change, or when I will have time to enter again post-mobilization.  I don't imagine that there will be internet access at Fort Bliss, nor the time to utilize it.  I will make every effort, however, to update this blog frequently.  "
12363,3576839,"27,July,2004",2004-07-27,"   Now that I have time to add more, I will.&nbsp; Fortunately for me I had the presence of mind to start writing down what was going on for most of the time in training for just such an occassion.  3 Jul 04 - We arrived in El Paso.&nbsp; The flight was very nice, the stewards were friendly and courteous to all of us.&nbsp; Prior to getting on the plane was a lot of tears and hugging.&nbsp; I wouldn't wish that day on anyone.&nbsp;   4 Jul 04 - The food at the basecamp (Dona Ana, outside of Fort Bliss, TX) is dismal, but on par with Army chow.&nbsp; This day consisted of a line that lasted for 8 hours to spend 5 minutes at the front getting an ID card.&nbsp; Luckily for us most of the wait was indoors with rows and rows of chairs and desks.&nbsp; On the other hand, we didn't know that we would be sitting for so long and didn't bring anything to do.&nbsp;   5 Jul 04 - This was a ""down day""&nbsp; which translates into ""we have nothing to do, so look busy.""&nbsp; We sat around the barracks all day.&nbsp; The barracks are fairly nice, good air conditioning and new beds.&nbsp; I have spent time in worse places.  6 Jul 04 - Woke up at 5:30 and had a road march with our body armor on.&nbsp; Imagine going for a walk, in long pants and long sleeve shirt, then throw on 50lbs. more gear.&nbsp; Later we were trained in identifying and reacting to UXO (unexploded ordinance) and IED's (Improvised Explosive Devices, a big killer in Iraq).&nbsp; I gave a class on identifying and treating heat injuries.  7 Jul 04 - Dad's B-day!&nbsp; We attended mandatory briefings - that means sitting through 8 hours of stuff we had heard at least twice before.&nbsp; Again, not so bad, since there was air conditioning.&nbsp;   8 Jul 04 - Another ""down day,"" which again we had to look busy.  9 Jul 04 - Red letter day!&nbsp; We did our SRP (soldier readiness packet) which consists of making sure you are up to date on your home of record, next of kin, life insurance, legal matters (marriages, births, divorces, powers of attorney) and of course MEDICAL!&nbsp; Everyones favorite, since that is where we get poked like little experimental monkeys.&nbsp; I got 6 different things: PPD (TB test), my first Anthrax shot (1 of a 6 shot series), Small Pox (turns into a nasty little bugger and made me feel very ill by about day 9), Typhoid, MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella), and a Hepatitis B shot.&nbsp; We were treated with a trip to the PX (Post eXchange, think Walmart with higher quality stuff and no sales tax) for our troubles.  10 Jul 04 - Went to CIF (Central Issue Facility) where we were issued our DCU's (Desert Camouflage Uniform) to include boots, Goretex jacket and pants, hats, and the uniforms themselves.&nbsp; It is always fun to get new stuff!&nbsp; The downside is having to break in new boots.  11 Jul 04 - I have something written down here that for the life of me, I can't remember what it is.&nbsp; So here is a joke: If someone speaks three languages they are called trilingual, someone that speaks&nbsp;two&nbsp;languages is called bilingual.&nbsp; So what is someone that speaks one language called?&nbsp; American.  12 Jul 04 - Had to go into Fort Bliss and drive in some vehicles.&nbsp; Managed to stop by the PX again...hard to resist when they have a food court.  13 Jul 04 - Oh yeah, this day.&nbsp; Well, we (medics) were tasked to support a range where some soldiers were zeroing their weapons.&nbsp; The thing is, the active duty component on Bliss is sending out Medics in ambulances to cover all our training.&nbsp; We knew this (since we had found out the hard way 2 days in a row) and told the commander as much.&nbsp; She said to go anyways, since we couldn't assume that they would be there.&nbsp; Long story short, we went, they came, we left.&nbsp; WASTE of a day all because our commander didn't want to listen to us.&nbsp; But hey, I did manage to make it to the PX again!  14, 15, 16 Jul 04 - This is where I forgot to write stuff down.&nbsp; I can't remember what we did.&nbsp; Probably wasn't important.  17 Jul 04 - Look at that!&nbsp; Another trip to the PX!  18 Jul 04 - Media awareness class.&nbsp; This is the Army's way of saying ""If you can't say something nice in front of the camera, don't say anything at all.""&nbsp; An interesting class, but I felt like hell because of the small pox shot.&nbsp; I had flu symptoms associated with the shot.&nbsp; Nothing like having a fever in the heat of the southwest and having to wear all that gear (50lbs., remember?).  19 Jul 04 - This amounted to a down day, which I needed for some recovery.&nbsp; I felt much better but still not quite up to snuff, what what?  20 Jul 04 - The PA (Physicians Assistant) at the TMC (Troop Medical Clinic) gave us a class on the signs and symptoms of the Flu, Cold, and Sinusitis.&nbsp; A very good class, and perfect for me since my sinuses were killing me.&nbsp;   21 Jul 04 - A day at the range.&nbsp; I must have sweat my body weight this day.&nbsp; The guy in front of me that was trying to zero his weapon couldn't shoot for shit.&nbsp; As a result, I had to stand in the HOT sun for hours and hours.&nbsp; He must have gone through 50 rounds of ammunition.&nbsp; They finally pulled him off to let me shoot.&nbsp; I was done in 12 rounds.&nbsp; From there we went to the SRM (Short Range Marksmanship) range.&nbsp; This would have been fun, but my head was killing me.&nbsp; I would have thought it would occur to me that it was my sinuses (which I discovered later) but I had sweat so much I thought it was dehydration.&nbsp; Brilliant, can't even properly diagnose myself.&nbsp;   22 Jul 04 - Today we did Land Navigation and PLGR training.&nbsp; A PLGR (pronounced ""plugger"") is a military GPS (global positioning system, using satellites to tell you where you are)&nbsp;unit that was the cutting edge of GPS technology 10 years ago.&nbsp; Since that time, they have gotten as small as a cellular phone, but the Army still uses the PLGR, which is&nbsp;several times that size.&nbsp; It was still good training, and a perfect day for it.&nbsp; Not too hot, a nice breeze.&nbsp; We were the first group to finish.&nbsp; Then we had to go and administer the second shot in the Anthrax series to some people.&nbsp; Nothing is as much fun as poking people with needles.&nbsp;   23, 24 Jul 04 - Again, forgot to write anything down.  25 Jul 04 - So there I was, doing laundry in the laundry room.&nbsp; I needed to go use the latrine so I grabbed my helmet and headed out.&nbsp; On the way the First Sergeant (highest ranking enlisted person) saw me and yelled to me.&nbsp; I thought I was in trouble for not having my gear on.&nbsp; As a matter of fact, the first thing he asked me was ""Where is your gear?""&nbsp; So I thought I was in trouble.&nbsp; He put his arm around me and said come with me.&nbsp; Then he dropped the hammer.&nbsp; ""Your Grandfather died.""&nbsp; Life's little curve ball.&nbsp; I responded by jumping away and saying ""What!?!""&nbsp; The next part was actually kind of funny looking back on it.&nbsp; He looked at the Red Cross message and showed me and said ""This is you, right?""&nbsp; You would think that would have been all verified by the time he told me, huh?&nbsp; Well, it was, I don't know what the hell he was doing.&nbsp; So, the Army flew me home the next day on Emergency Leave for 12 days, free of charge.  26 Jul 04 - LONG flight, crappy layovers, didn't get in until midnight.&nbsp; Still, nice to be home and see my girlfriend and the puppies.  27 Jul 04 - Grampa's viewing is tommorrow, and the funeral is the next day.&nbsp; I am a pall bearer.&nbsp; I have been a pall bearer for each of my grandparents that have passed, all within the last ten years.&nbsp; I am quite sure I will cry my heart out, since we were pretty close.&nbsp; No shame there.&nbsp; I wish he would have known I was going to Iraq before he went.&nbsp; Nothing to be done about it, though.&nbsp; I will put in an extra set of dogtags in with him.&nbsp;&nbsp;He is a WWII vet that I am very proud of, so he will undestand the gesture. &nbsp;He went peacefully after a walk in the morning.&nbsp; He had struggled with congestive heart failure for a couple of years now, and we had struggled with his failing eyesight and hearing for much longer.&nbsp; Still, hard to imagine the man that used to take me and my brother fishing and camping is being returned to the earth.&nbsp;  I had hopes that he would hang on at least until I came back from Iraq.&nbsp;  "
12364,3576839,"15,July,2004",2004-07-15,"   So here I am in Fort Bliss and it is hot hot HOT.  I don't get much internet (this is the first time) so I will make this short.  We have done some training, but real training doesn't start until late July.  Temps reach near 100 every day, and we have to wear about 50 pounds of gear.  We are treated pretty well, and the barracks we stay in are actually alright.  The air conditioning works, so no complaints there.  There is a level of frustration with the amount of flexibility we are supposed to have, but please refer to ""Being Gumby.""  We finished getting new uniforms (desert, duh) and have gotten cleared through medical.  Of course, clearing through medical meant 6 shots for me, including anthrax and small pox.  None of them hurt much, so it is all good.  That small pox is poxing up really nice, which is disgusting.  It is like a massive whitehead on my shoulder.  It should be healed fairly soon, though.  On a personal note, if anyone emails me, please use my military address.  I cannot check my Yahoo! from this computer, so who knows how it will be when we get ""in-country.""  I will write more as I can, and I am keeping a bit of a log so I will more fully update it as the opportunity arises.  "
11916,3577655,"10,June,2004",2004-06-10,"   Ok everybody. I'm going to admit I'm  not the most unfortunate soul out there. And I feel bad. So I want all of us to start praying for Kellie's friend who just lost everything in a fire.   Psalm 23 A psalm of David. 1 The LORD is my shepherd, I shall not be in want.  2 He makes me lie down in green pastures, he leads me beside quiet waters,  3 he restores my soul. He guides me in paths of righteousness for his name's sake. 4 Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for you are with me; your rod and your staff, they comfort me.  5 You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. You anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows.  6 Surely goodness and love will follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the LORD forever.  Wow I love that passage. Later  "
11917,3577655,"09,June,2004",2004-06-09,"   As some of you might have known I had an interview with Dierburgs and it went really well. But today I got a letter from them saying Thanks but No Thanks. I guess its back to job hunting for me. This really sucks I was so ready and I really needed it too. Totally of subject here but would those stupid telemarketers (no clue how to spell) please stop calling us, were on the no call list thingy.  Later  "
11918,3577655,"09,June,2004",2004-06-09,"   Ok, every one else is like doing things every single day except for me. I just sit around all day doing nothing. This is so stupid. OOOOO I get to go to Texas. I'm so excited Texas. Can you catch the sarcasm. If not then um yeah. That's all for now. I just thought I would share that.  Later  "
11919,3577655,"09,June,2004",2004-06-09,"   Well I can tell that it's summer now. I've already slept into 12:00 pm one day, I've stayed up till 2:00 am and I'm waiting to pull an allnighter.  It's starting to get really hot outside, man am I happy that we have a pool. Not that I use it that much. But if I ever need to I know that it is there. O yeah, I saw Shrek 2 it was awsome. There are still some movies that I wanna see. Well I'll post some more stuff later.  "
26423,3586100,"30,June,2004",2004-06-30,"   At some point in my four years at Denison, I remember making the (yes, I know, somewhat  dubious ) connection between Simon and Garfunkel's ""I am a Rock, I am an I-I-I-Island"" and the ""cultural personality"" of Great Britain.  Despite discouragement in attributing this song by  American  folk artists to a comment on the psyche of the British nation, I feel that at least the refrain of this song says everything about our ancestral maternal nation.    And now, when the entire European community is faced with the ratifying of an EU constitution, GroÃŸ Britannia is once again asserting her sceptical, biting sarcasam mixed with a grave and insistent fear that she will lose her sovereignty, not to mention her credibility in light of Blair's Iraq soireÃ©, both of which she considers to be in a delicate, but--as in all things British-- gradual , decline.  A friend of mine from Berlin who is as fiercely critical of Germany as I am of the United States insists that Britain's role as stubborn, but nonetheless respected, objector to the ""federalising"" of the European Union into a model akin, frighteningly enough, to the U.S. Federal government is  essential  to the survival of a balanced and better Europe.  For a vast majority of the time, however, Britain's stubbornness in refusing to join the Euro has angered many of my other friends from the continent, in addition to a fellow countryman and friend, who characterised Britain as a nation ""disobedient"" and unwilling to understand the European ethos.  Of course, this same friend also spent considerable time in the UK and as a result of a number of unfortunate factors--one of which was a residency in the nucleus of racial violence and tension in the UK--he was moved to almost completely denounce this country.  Indeed, if I had lived there, or had grown up in the nucleus of racial and ethnic tension in Britain, I too, would have felt very much the same as he did and perhaps still does.  The truth is, I live in cushy, benign Edinburgh, a jewel in the island's crown.  But like all jewels upon closer examination, one finds a lack of interesting visual depth thanks to the blinding ricochet of light across all of its sides.  Edinburgh sparkles, and enjoys a vibrant history and tourism industry, but she lacks the passionate, and defiant, pride of herself in the face of over a century of industrial exhaustion like that of her oft-overlooked sister city, Glasgow.  Since I am doing my PhD at Glasgow University and live in Edinburgh (both cities linked by a relatively high-speed rail line that reduces an hour-and-a-half journey to forty-five minutes), I have been able to revel in the bounties and be disdainful about the shortcomings of both.    I love my sister cities equally, and for different reasons.  But I shall post on that in the future.  What concerns me in this post is the Anglo-American matrix of politics, culture, and identity.  Okay, so that sentence is way too broad and way too ambitious for a blog  topic , let alone a blog posting.  Rather, I should say, being the egoist that this blog somehow requires me to be, how this matrix affects me when I travel between what I now consider to be my two homelands.   The first time I came back to the States since I began studying and living in Scotland in  the fall of 2002 was last November.  A year and a half outside of my country actually caused me to be  afraid  of going back to face it.  I had thus far enjoyed--and still do--a long and beautiful relationship with my boyfriend, Daniel, along with the gradual formation of a few friendships.  Last September, Jimmy and I moved in with our third flatmate, Marcelle, into 69 Arden Street, and began to develop a sort of ""Victorian family"" as Marcelle jokingly referred to us when we first moved into the place.  Everything seemed to come together into a steady balance in my life after a year of difficult adjustment to the loss of my Denison community and the need to build a new, but different, one.  Why was I so scared to leave the country for what would be such a short amount of time--two and a half weeks?  Partly, I must SHAMEFULLY admit, my fear was due to that infintesimal part of my American psyche which actually listens to the fear-mongering reports of terrorist attacks to come...and transatlantic flights certainly bring these images to the furore, whether you agree with the presentation of the images or not.    Another reason for my ambiguous fear was certainly the idea of having to face a place with which I will eternally identify myself with, but also a place which throws alot of oppositional weight against me.  Now that I have lived in a culture where cynicism and intense scepticism seem, at times, to be a way of life, going back to the fresh-faced, moral certainty and die-hard optimism of the United States almost seemed like attending a farcical parody of my current life.  I suddenly cringed at the public ""loudness"" of people in airports, even though I have been guilty of worse ""loudness"" both in the States and in the UK.  When the immigration official stamped my passport for re-entry into the  States, he had obviously glanced at my visa stamps for studying in the UK, since he remarked, ""Welcome Back"".  When he said that very phrase, I almost wanted to turn back to him and say, ""Thanks for the kind gesture, but I'm not back  yet .""  The resoluteness of his ""welcome back"" reminded me of the days in which my Mother's friends often tried to convince me to stay in Youngstown and pursue a career there, often decrying some sort of reason that Hubbard, my hometown, was ""where I belonged.""  Now, walking through customs, I felt both overwhelmingly flattered at such an unusual comment coming from a stern INS official, and yet almost angry at him for supposing that I was somehow overjoyed to be back ""where I belong.""  No more at any other time in my life thus far did I so desire to have a dual citizenship, a concealed maroon European Union passport burning in another sachel pocket somewhere, an emblem of my second, and secret, community across the water.    As I write this, I fully realise the elitist privilege that comes with my feelings.   I know that there are hundreds of people out there who deserve a British passport far more than I do...namely, the hundreds of asylum seekers who come to Britain's shores annually, with whom the British government still has no idea how to deal humanely and effectively.  But I must concur that my desire for this dual citizenship would not be so resolute in me if I felt that the U.S. was successful at participating in the international community.  For me, coming back Stateside, in the first half-hour, is like being shut off from the life that I've built across the ocean.  Instead of the BBC and the Guardian, I have to make do with CNN, and FOX on airport televisions, but in print, I do have my friend who I miss terribly in Britain--the New Yorker.  It's the bombastic style with which our news anchors ""blare"" out the news that always strikes me with the most annoyance when I return...that and the fact that unless it's connected with Iraq, most international news gets little coverage.  This is not to say that British media outlets don't have their own selectiveness, but overall, I get a much bigger glimpse of the world reading a British newspaper than I do when I read an American one (with the exception of the New Yorker).      However, after about an hour or so back in the Pittsburgh airport last November, I began to grow back into the comfortable spaces of my previous life in Girard, beginning with a huddle into the chilly passenger-side seat of John's enormous 1984 Oldsmobile Royale (more boat than car).  And when I spent that long weekend before Thanksgiving in Cleveland with Sarah, Tara, Katie, and Kara, I felt completely restored to my place on both sides of the Atlantic.  In fact, I felt  more  connected to both of my lives after reuniting with Denison friends in Cleveland and Columbus that trip.  As I have said numerous times before, and I hope I will say numerous times in the future, the friendships that I have made at Denison prove time and time again to be some of the rarest and most privileged friendships that I will ever experience.  I know that when I return to a country that can seem so alien in its familiarity to me, these are the people who remind me, who give me back, what my home is in the United States.  And this home does not heed boundaries.  That ""welcome back"" can be reappropriated for my entrance back into this home, this place that I feel envelops the very personal space around me when I encounter these friends.  This is the America I love, the America that lives and smolders underneath the cacophony of everyday stress and cultural noise.  It's the America that every American deserves to have, and deserves to  pursue , to borrow a worn-out term from our forefathers' documents.    It is also to this very home that I will be initiated back into when I land in Columbus on the 12th of July this year, and when I again land in LAX on the 21st of July.  I will be crossing borders, time zones, and yet, it will seem like a mere train ride from Edinburgh to Glasgow once I am in the thick of wedding plans and long conversations.    Before this post wavers from its focus any more than it already has, I shall end this submission, with the intent to expand--evermore, in reality--on my experiences as an inconsequential, but rather LOUD expat.  And please, PLEASE contribute.  Don't let this be a mere monologue.    I love you all.   "
26424,3586100,"15,June,2004",2004-06-15,"   This Sunday, thanks to Daniel (my Scotsman, for those of you who do not know) and his sister's 3-hour-long wait in the queue outside of the ticketing counter this past January, I was able to attend Scotland's only performance of the Red Hot Chili Peppers at Murrayfield Stadium, which is the home court for Scotland's National Rugby in Edinburgh.  For the first time, I got to experience the jostle-jostle, huddle-huddle of the standing crowd...i.e. ""the pit"" in Shakespearean terms.  We were about half-way down the field, which was pretty decent considering that over 50,000 people were expected at this concert; however, despite the huge projection screens placed on either side of the stage scaffolding, I was blocked of any real view of anything in front of me besides heads and backs.  Still, one goes in the crowd for crowd-spirit rather than visual accuracy, but what I realised is that, well...I'm old.  Not only do I like having a seat to recline in, but I also really began to appreciate the privilege one has in the stands--to altogether avoid hooligans who drink as much as they are determined to push through the already health-hazardous crowd to get to the stagefront.  I have to say that both Daniel and I are pretty much set on the idea of seated tickets, even if it does mean that the drummer's head squashes nicely between your forefinger and thumb. ;-)  As far as the band goes, I have to admit that I was even more impressed with the lyrical intelligence and musicianship of a band that could easily have sold out to the mainstream without losing record sales.  Sure, the crazy stuff off Blood Sugar Sex Magik was most definitely ""pussy-oriented"" and over-masculinised at times, but it's that unique energy, that refusal to simply strum chords that sound fast and loud, that has given the Red Hot Chili Peppers their distinctive style and what also allowed them to make such an astonishingly mature and vital contribution to popular rock music.  We're about a bass guitarist here--Flea--who can play faster than the band's own lead guitarist, in addition to beginning his career as a Jazz trumpeter (and let me add an astonishing one--during the encore, he gave a five-minute trumpet solo).  John Fruscanti, the lead guitarist, also single-handedly does all of the high-falsetto back-up singing for Anthony Kiedis, and his falsetto, which you often lose when you listen to their studio albums, could put many tenors to shame (but not any of the ones I know, of course).   HOWEVER, I must admit that Daniel and I would have enjoyed Sunday's show alot more if we hadn't heard Chilis music on a weekly basis.  The songs are amazing--particularly off Californication--but like anything else, you can most certainly have too much of a good thing.  On the other hand, when I've seen Ani DiFranco or Tori Amos in concert, it was often during times in my life where all I mainly listened to were Ani and Tori--perhaps it has more to do with the venue than the music itself.  I was in the back row of my first Tori concert, and she was a microscopic speck, but I somehow felt immensely more connected to her performance than I did to the Chilis' on Sunday.  Or perhaps--and this is a good thing--I have grown past that stage in my life where I allowed my music to define my emotional and spiritual identity.  Or maybe it was simply the fact that I had to stand on my feet in one place for 5 hours straight. Hmmm.   "
26425,3586100,"09,June,2004",2004-06-09,"   Because I am immensely jealous of those who have set up blogs that make excellent use of discussion in a responsible and interesting manner, I too, will attempt to evolve this meager blogspot into a forum that I hope will be not only useful in facilitating discussion on a variety of public (and semi-personal) matters, but also a place where I can ground aspects of my own PhD research through presenting it in a concise manner on the web.    I may or may not reach all of these objectives, but hey, optimism's always worth at least one try. ;-)   "
26426,3586100,"18,July,2004",2004-07-18,"   This entry is disgustingly short, but is merely a reassurance that I am still intent on actively blogging...it's just that I landed in the States about five days ago and haven't really stopped running around, reading, eating, drinking coffee, and visiting since I arrived!&nbsp; (Not to mention that I had to use the previous two weeks to prepare for this trip in the midst of a fast-approaching PhD deadline.)&nbsp; But I will be updating soon, especially in light of the tantalising new features in the Blogger dashboard just recently added.&nbsp; :-)&nbsp;   &nbsp; It's truly disgusting how much I love Lucida Grande.&nbsp;  &nbsp; And how excited I am to once again see Graham crackers and pretzels on the grocery store shelves.&nbsp; And  sour  kosher dill pickles.&nbsp;  &nbsp; All I need now to complete my ""tastes of home"" binging is three or four cobs of bright yellow corn, drenched in butter and salt... &nbsp; Just one brief thought in relation&nbsp;to Americans ""returning"" to America: Sarah Borron said the best sentence I've heard in days on Friday afternoon. &nbsp; ""You see, I've developed a little crush on our country, America."" &nbsp; Echoed in the lyrics of Scottish-born, but American-bred, David Byrne, ""Can I afford to move above my station? I'm not the only heart you've conquered.""&nbsp;&nbsp; (""Miss America"", from Feelings ) &nbsp; (By the way, I feel it is only appropriate at this time to thank the Gingrich clan of Annville, PA for introducing David Byrne to me in the summer of 2002.&nbsp; Since musical knowledge and choice&nbsp;are often used as rubrics for one's cultural savvy and emotional/intellectual capacity, I feel it only fair to acknowledge those who placed such pivotal pieces&nbsp;in my reperatoire.&nbsp; However, basing one's judgement of an individual on their CD or mp3 collection is pretty shallow and lame...and yet, I feel that many of us at one time or another--particularly during undergrad, seem to have done it with someone we either adored deeply or despised immensely.&nbsp; In reality, I often&nbsp;conjure up&nbsp;my memories of specific people with the music they once&nbsp;introduced me to.&nbsp;  &nbsp; By the way, Brad, this is my que to thank you for permanently altering my conception of pop music...or rather, for  rescuing  me from my previous conceptions of pop music.&nbsp; And do I ever&nbsp;miss your radio show.)   "
26427,3586100,"02,July,2004",2004-07-02,"   In the midst of attempting to find a USEFUL map of the United States online, Daniel and I instead found lots of information on cross-country RVing materials.  For those of you who are unaware of the American RVing culture (RV, meaning ""recreational vehicle""), it's basically the concept of piling your entire immediate family--and perhaps a few non-smelly friends--into a vehicle that is neither truck nor trailer, but a huge, clumsy lovechild of the two.  The intention is that you and your squashed posse will venture across the United States--or at least over to Aunt Verna's 300 miles away, where she'll let you park the beast in her already sun-parched lawn--in pursuit of a cheap and somewhat ""character-building"" holiday experience.  Plus, you never have to worry about hotel or motel vacancies, but of course, when you carry your house with you, you do have to pay other people to put up with it on their property (i.e. campgrounds).    HOWEVER, a certain site cheerfully reports that for those RVers on a tight budget, over 3,500 WAL-MART stores across the nation will allow your tired and whiney family to spend the night in their parking lots for free: http://www.newrver.com/.  Wow.  And and if that offer wasn't enticing enough on its own, newrver.com offers their clientele a 195-page directory, complete with detailed driving directions, of practically all of the the WAL-MARTs one can find in the 48 continental United States.  Below is the description of this must-have for all avid RV adventurers.    (found on http://rvbookstore.com/shop/detail.aspx?m=2&p=185)      Wal-Mart Locator, 2004  Wal-Mart isnâ€™t a campground, but you might think otherwise some evenings when the corner of a storeâ€™s parking lot may be occupied by a few or even a few dozen RVers who are ""camped"" for the night. Most Wal-Mart stores permit an overnight stay in a self-contained RV, and thatâ€™s where this directory comes in very handy.   While Wal-Mart sells an atlas that lists the addresses of its stores, the atlas doesnâ€™t provide driving directions, which can make finding some stores downright difficult. The 2004 Wal-Mart Locator, on the other hand, does provide specific driving directions, enabling RVers to easily locate more than 3,500 Wal-Mart and Sam's Club stores in the 48 states.   Most RVers stay at a Wal-Mart when they need a place to get a nightâ€™s rest and a campground isnâ€™t handy. They donâ€™t mind the price tag either: free. Others routinely plan their travels to include an overnight stop at a Wal-Mart store. Saving the $20 or $30 (or more!) they would pay at a campground can help offset high fuel prices.   The Wal-Mart Locator includes state maps, which provide a general idea of store locations. From that, they can find specific stores with information about which exit to take off a highway or Interstate, and where to go after that. The directory also includes store Zip Codes for use in aiming TV satellite dishes.   The authors of the popular guide are veteran RVers who found it challenging to find Wal-Marts as they traveled. So they decided to create an easy-to-use directory that would make the task easy. They succeeded. 195 pages. Published 2004. $19.95    Wow.  Imagine that one of your greatest ambitions in contributing to this ""bustling"" culture was to ease the ""challenges"" of finding a WAL-MART on one's journey throughout the States.    It certainly makes one re-evaluate one's thoughts on that trip to Vancouver, or to Paris, doesn't it?  I mean, with prospects of plopping down in front of that big, luminous marquis that is identical to the one that shines across the road from you at home, it just makes you wonder why you even venture to think about leaving the county borders, let alone the country.  In fact, there's a 24-hour Super WAL-MART just 20 miles away, with a perfectly in-tact marquis (and a mean crop of donuts in the early morning, I'm told) and clean restrooms (I should know, I use them at least twice a week), so why bother taking the kids to the Grand Canyon, when all they really want to do is wander around the isles first thing in the morning, chomping on donuts and slurping their sugar-encrusted slush-puppies?   "
26428,3586100,"01,July,2004",2004-07-01,"   Indeed, Brad, you are correct to call me on my attempt to join the aesthetics of PJ Harvey and Virginia Woolf.  Actually, my intention was not so much to join their aesthetic causes as to point out that Woolf would no doubt be impressed by the fact that ideas of female independence, particularly outside of marriage, have infiltrated into the psyche of popular culture.    However, Woolf may also have detested a voice like Harvey's for the mere fact that Woolf hated ""feminism"" and those women who participated as social activists, even if she was supportive of their cause, like the suffragists (not to be confused with the more fanatical branch, the  suffragettes ).  PJ Harvey isn't a social activist, but she is a voice within popular culture that demonstrates one current definition of femininity to which women in Woolf's time did not have such easy access.    But you're right Brad.  I mean, Jesus, ""Lick my legs, I'm on Fire""   versus    The trumpeters, ranging themselves side by side in order, blow one terrific blast:-- ""THE TRUTH!"" at which Orlando awoke. He stretched himself.  He rose.  He stood upright in complete nakedness before us, and while the trumpets pealed Truth! Truth! Truth! we have no choice left but confess--he was a woman. ( Orlando , Penguin Classics 2000 edition, page 97)   Clearly, we know who wins when it comes to literary prowess (not to mention the redefinition of femininity).  I've often thought recently how funny it would be to bring people from the last 100 years into our era if we had such a means to do it.  I think Woolf, who would be at first horrified by the polarisation of political opinion and the loudness and vulgarity of our popular culture, would eventually begin to laugh...and perhaps not stop for quite a while (which, apparently, she was known to do, in addition to having a notorious, and sometimes  disturbing  laugh).    I mean, just imagine Woolf and Orwell in a room listening to ""Sabotage"" by the Beastie Boys, or ""She Lives in My Lap"" by Outkast.    It's sad, boys and girls, but that image thoroughly amuses me.  (To be honest, the only popular musical artists of today that I can think of who would come even close to the literary sensibility and wit of Woolf would be Dar Williams, Joni Mitchell, and Aimee Mann, with a bit of David Byrne and Jim White occasionally thrown in there. Perhaps even the Pogues.   Definitely  Christy Moore.  And a few songs by the Indigo Girls, especially ""Reunion"":   All you pretty pretenders Negligent vendors Aren't you precious inside? I have no need for anger With intimate strangers And I got nothing to hide )   "
26429,3586100,"01,July,2004",2004-07-01,"   After re-reading today's post a third time, I have finally come to realise my inadequacy in completing ANY LINE OF THINKING which I initiate at the beginning of any piece of writing.    If only I thought in spider webs rather than tree trunks and tree branches.   Yet another skill to add to the list of ""blog aesthetics"".  (No wonder I've never been able to write a coherent essay.)  On a final note, I'd like to clarify the passage in which I asserted that I wished this blog, partly, to be an exploration of ""Marianne, the graduate student and person.""  Perhaps a more lucid way of expressing this would be ""Marianne, an apprentice to the academy, as well as to ideological tolerance, and Marianne, your friend.""  Okay, I'm off now to listen to PJ Harvey.  Her new album sounds quite good to me, but of course, I do not have any knowledge of her work previous to ""Stories of the City, Stories by the Sea"" (save for the song ""Rid of Me"", which one of my friends once played for me in the hopes that PJ's anger growling through the words ""lick my legs, I'm on fire!"" would inspire my own rage-filled revolution of personal assertion).  My favourite song so far on the album: ""Pocketknife"":   Please don't make my wedding dress I'm too young to marry yet Can you see my pocketknife? You can't make me be your wife.   I think Woolf would be proud of our PJ.  Or be scared of her.   "
26430,3586100,"01,July,2004",2004-07-01,"   I would like to take these few lines to express a sincere gratitude to Mr. Reed, who has a most excellent (and far superior and long-running) blog at http://www.livejournal.com/users/bradreed/.  His aesthetic recommendations will most certainly be heeded in the future, and in light of those suggestions, I must apologise to my readers for my lack of understanding the need for paragraphs.    So, let this entry be the beginning of a much more sound blog aesthetic.   P.S. I also would like to apologise for the rather scathing critique of other blogs which I included the email which I sent out to actually inform people of this blog's existence.  The critique was meant to be more ironic than seriously critical.  The great thing about blogs is that EVERYONE has access to publishing their thoughts--whether personal, political, or in relation to a specific project--on the web without the tangles and bureaucracy (not to mention the money) of traditional publishing.  What I meant to say was that I hope my blog can, eventually, develop into a resource of cultural, as well as personal, dialogue with all those who wish to read it and to contribute to it.    When you're writing a PhD, you often get sealed in your insularity, and especially with the ""ghosts"" of your authors.  For instance, I've been reading the gigantic tome that is Hermione Lee's comprehensive biography of Virginia Woolf.  Over the last few days, I am finally realising why some of those crazed feminist critics part of--but certainly not all     of--the American school of Woolfians who wish to canonise ""St. Virginia"" (as one critic referred to the process) really begin to feel as if they ""know"" Virginia, and dammit, how no one else does.  If there are any Woolfites out there, do pick it up if you can--it's a very compelling, but exquisitely balanced narrative of Woolf's life.    But back to my original point: this insularity really makes me wish to have a greater dialogue with others about my work, as well as about my position and identity as ""Marianne, the graduate student and person.""  And who better to have this dialogue with than the people who've known me best, as well as people who've known me fairly well, even if for a shorter period of time?    I've changed a great deal since I left Denison, and yet, I find myself evermore striving to reappropriate the experiences and knowledge I gained there to the spaces of my life here in Edinburgh and Glasgow.  I feel that because I now have a great gulf of two years between myself and our graduation, I can finally begin to put into words what happened to me, and to indeed all of us, while we were there for four years.    ""Is it not possible--I often wonder--that things we have felt with great intensity have an existence independent of our minds; are in fact still in existence?  And if so, will it not be possible, in time, that some device will be invented by which we can tap them?  I see it--the past--as an avenue lying behind; a long ribbon of scenes, emotions[...]Instead of remembering here a scene and there a sound, I shall fit a plug into the wall; and listen in to the past.  I shall turn up August 1890.  I feel that strong emotion must leave its trace; and it is only a question of discovering how we can get ourselves again attached to it, so that we shall be able to live our lives through from the start.""   Moments of Being , Virginia Woolf   "
21017,3590380,"23,June,2004",2004-06-23,"   Horrible time in work today.  Our clientele is becoming increasingly aggressive, verbally and physically and we do not appear to be getting the support we are entitled to. Today, our ""closed to the public"" day, a drunk and violent man caused havoc at reception, a junior member of staff was told to show him to a cubicle and deal with him, even though this man's behaviour has caused our team leader to call the police already this week and even though this same man threatened to assault a member of staff with a stick a couple of weeks ago.  The member of staff who had to deal with him today is only (and forgive my ageism here) a youngster on a bare Â£160 a week and none of us is trained to deal with such a situation, even though we are frontline staff. The same grade of staff took an assault last Thursday when a client threw a keyboard at her under the protective (yeah, right) plexi screen in a cubicle... just before he kicked down the keycoded door to the office... Bloody stinks.  My blog, I can swear if I want to.  Senior management remained seated in its freakin' ivory tower with a nice view of the river... on all occasions.  Bringing the state of mind right down to a relaxed level is another favourite blog of mine,  urlLink Mr. Dunstan Orchard , currently in San Fran and experiencing life to the max, as he always does. Sweetie.  "
21018,3590380,"20,June,2004",2004-06-20,"   Well, the day arrived that my daughter has soooooo been waiting for, the sleepover party to celebrate her 9th birthday!!! Nine little school mates duly arrived, a profusion of pink and glitter and proceeded to snuggle down in their sleeping bags to watch the DVD of  urlLink Freaky Friday  and stuff their little heads with as much garlic bread and pizza as I could cook.  Boy can those kids eat!! While all this was going on I was also tripping back and fore to the field behind our house to check up on no. 1 son Chris as he was camping out with some mates for the second night on the trot, again fuelling more than my own kids with various munchies!! Two of the little girls didn't seem to get on with each other too well but as I am very fond of them both (Lizzie and Jessie) it was relatively easy to keep the peace. I fell asleep with my youngest on my chest (no, not breastfeeding! She's six!!! eeewww!!) and woke at around 12.30 with an asthma attack, nothing major, but a klingon remnant of a rotten cold!! My living room now looks like a balloon cemetery and I just want to drink tea. Thankfully my Mum was a huuuge help pre-party, cleaning my kitchen and pegging washing out etc, feel a bit crap that I didn't get to spend much time with her but we are going to Bridgend for a friend's 60th party next week so will catch up properly then! Catch up later xxx  "
21019,3590380,"09,June,2004",2004-06-09,"   Having had a major 24 hours of shouting and tears from myself and my 2 eldest kids and my husband, I decided I needed to get away, but, in my insolvent circumstances, this is the cheapest, most appropriate getaway I could come up with at short notice!  I've been reading a couple of blogs for a few months now and have become very fond of them... when I have learned how to link you to them, I'll put the addresses up on here, ok?... Oo... here goes... may have just learned this one...   urlLink Sian's blog  "
21020,3590380,"19,July,2004",2004-07-19,"   Dave was duly collected by two chaps from the Joint Forces Defence Animal Centre at Melton Mowbray, where they also look after ""all the Queen's horses"" etc.&nbsp; They deemed him a potential asset as a Search Dog, and said that people would be fighting over him as he looks so good.&nbsp; They have asked that we send a disposable camera so that they can keep us informed of his progress during training and have invited us to ring any time.&nbsp; A good outcome in the long run, but Chris, my eldest, is very down as a result at the moment, which is being exorcised by shouting and unpleasant behaviour.&nbsp; Can't say I blame him, but it is starting to pee me off now... I have a glazier coming this afternoon to quote for the window he smashed. &nbsp; Went to the doc this morning and he has given me a note for another fortnight.&nbsp; I expected to feel better by now, but am pleased that my reactions to situations are much calmer, less highly strung.&nbsp; All good stuff. &nbsp; Haven't heard anything about the job, so I presume I have not been shortlisted. That's the way it goes, so, their loss! &nbsp; Hah! Just found out how to change the time on these things!! There ya go! Am not midnight blogging any more!! &nbsp; xxx &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  "
21021,3590380,"12,July,2004",2004-07-12,"   Me and Imodium, we're like  that , (crosses fingers and thrusts them in your face).    Well, Friday got better (tangible sarcasm here) when I drove to the other side of town to take Jasmine's suitcase over to Holly's house for her to stay the night there.  I stopped for half an hour with Holly's mum, Jackie, who is my nemesis! Always sweet, calm, mother-earthly, studying to be a children's nurse and she has five-yes-five kids! I went through a packet of paper tissues in that half hour, not through crying (I really AM a lot better now!) but by soaking them with , errmmm, nose stuff. Sorry.  I left Jackie's and was just turning into my street when the mobile rang, Mrs Gardner asking me to pick up Jasmine as she was unwell.  1...2...3...4...5...6...etc. Got to 10, took a deep breath and travelled almost all the way back to Jackie's to school to pick up poorly child.  Not poorly, doesn't like discos and there was the end of term party in full swing with veeerrry loud music.  Put Jas in the car ""I feel better now, can I go back in?""  ...7...8...9...10!  I put my foot down with a firm hand and said ""No, we are going home and Daddy can take you to Holly's later on"".  We walked Dave (our soon-to-be-enlisted labrador, therein lies a whole new blog!) when we got home and made our way to the bus stop. Thank you Lord for this stress, this cold, this bad chest (I put my back out coughing!) and you obviously know I can cope with more 'cause you choose NOW, when my mother is an hour away from coming up to blow out her birthday candles on the Groovy Chick cake, NOW, to give me a  migraine  too!!! Woohoo!!! (Please be aware, I'm not moaning, I just find this incredibly funny!!!)  Never mind!! I pack off to bed, having distributed the kids around various parts of the Cynon Valley and fend off numb legs, arms, mouth, blindness, nausea etc for an amazing two hours (these things used to last 12hours+ when I was a kid, so I am a professional migrainer now, shaving minutes off my time with each episode!).  The headache never appears, having popped a naughty 3 nurofen.   This said, I am, in all honesty, feeling positive and I have more clarity now about the direction I want to take, as a Mum, wife and colleague.  I just need this week to start getting some stuff organised on paper and I think progress will be made.  Two major decisions have been made, the main one is about our dog, Dave.  He is a delightful 2 and a half year old black labrador, fit and lean and bored.  He can leap the 6ft fence around our (large) garden and will not come back from the field behind us when called, preferring to obsess over an old stone, which CANNOT be taken from him, he is so possessive.  To cut a long story short, the Forces Dog Procurement Unit will hopefully be coming to assess his potential as a drugs and explos dog for the Army or the RAF, a good outcome for us and the dog.  The second decision may not sound much, but I have gorn and gort meself a credit card, too much month and not enough money means that new school uniform will have to bought this way this year! 0% interest for 9 months so all will be well, and no, I won't fritter!  Oh, and I have applied for a newly funded job in my department, I don't think I'll get it, I think they will appoint externally, but at least I tried! I have experience in all fields the job requires and I know I am capable, but sometimes these appointments are political, so who knows!   xxx  "
21022,3590380,"09,July,2004",2004-07-09,"   Thursday night is always a long haul in our house and last night was the longest!  It was parents' evening at the primary school, so I duly waited to speak to Miss Morgan (Jasmine's) teacher and was delighted to read Jas's work whilst waiting.  How well this young lady has brought Jasmine on this year! She came to Beth's class frustrated at not understanding the building blocks of reading, guessing at words and getting upset, not able to grasp the base words of ""the"", ""and"", etc. well, she has in this time completed the reading course the school uses and is now on ""librarys"" as they say, I think she is now in the top 3 in the class.  Beth said ""I don't really need to see you, I just wish I had a class full of Jasmines""  *beam*.  Sophie had a similiarly pleasant report, she has a particularly good teacher this year, but, like her two brothers before her, Sophie has felt a personality clash with this teacher.  Her work is good, but I wish this teacher would be a little more encoraging in her comments, rather than looking to the mistakes so often.  I hate to see red x's on a child's work with no explanation? Then after plying the two scholars with a Happy Meal each, a quick phone call en route home ""tell Nick to go wash ready for Confirmation Class"" in time for his 6 o'clock class.  I'm sure God won't really mind a grubby 12 year old but makes me feel better in a control freak way if I present a sparkling child before the Lord at least once a week! Next stop, Athletics club for Sophie, a 2 hour stint at the Sports Centre, having picked Nicky up from Church. Too tired to go home at this point, I call in on a friend with a bag of chips for Nick, pouring out my, by now considerable, woes. She takes me to the front of the house at 8.45, to wave me off, to pick up Sophie, and BUGGER, I drop my car keys down a drain. Trying not to panic, I realise that THE ONLY HOUSE KEY is now in the depths of the drain.  Gareth is in Torquay, an overnighter after interviewing somebody, and took both sets of house keys with him by accident. One bent meat skewer, a frantic call to another friend to pick Sophie up and some deep breathing later, I retrieve the keys, rinse off the muck and am delighted to find that the remote still works on them too ( By now, however, I am clinically insane)! I don't know how, but I get home at 9.45, fend off tantrum from Jasmine because there is no Ready Brek in the house and get the girls to bed, SugarPuffed, at around 10.00.  Surprise, Surprise, throughout all this I have developed ANOTHER frickin' cold. I am a virus magnet.  This morning, I get shouted at at 5.30 by no. 1 son, Chris for waking him to ""shadow"" a paper round before doing it properly next week, then shouted at again at 7.00 for  not  waking him as he has overslept. Teenage logic. I have just had a phone call from him at school to bring down his PE kit as he left it behind.  Am very tempted to put in my frilliest bra and knickers just for spite.   On a high note, the Prozac is reducing my appetite, making me nauseous and giving me the shits. Should be a good weight loss this week then. Swapsies anyone?  xxx  "
21023,3590380,"06,July,2004",2004-07-06,"   ... and praying there is someone there to catch you.  Well, something had to give and thanks to my superb doctor, I now have 2 weeks off work.  ""just go home and think, do a bit of tidying, a bit of ironing"".  May sound like the wrong thing to say, but this chap knows me too well!! I didn't realise how crappy I was feeling in toto until I got home and more or less collapsed onto the floor after seeing the doc.  I think it was out of relief more than illness.  I feel terribly guilty that I have left colleagues with my work, part of me hopes it is still on my desk when I go back, but from what the doctor said, I think he wants me off work for longer than a fortnight. So be it.  I have had various forms of depression, teenage stuff, postnatal etc for over 20 years and I know when I am on the way down.  Unfortunately it took longer than usual for me to realise it this time and I have bridges to build with the kids, especially the oldest two.  I'm the grownup, I should be able to deal with their emotions, they shouldn't have to deal with mine. Work has been a major player in this decline for the last couple of weeks though.  Not good to be crying in the car park in the morning, summoning up the courage to face those colleagues (I really am very fond of them, perhaps I care too much?) and try and get through another day of exasperation, underorganisation, lack of space, lack of guidance, lack of a trustworthy bloody computer system...  Anyway.  God Bless Prozac and all who fail in her.   xxx  "
2189,3596192,"10,June,2004",2004-06-10,"    Plans for the garden are taking shape and growing! I have spent hours working in the space - getting to know the space, really. Now I have committed my ideas to paper, staked out the areas, and know the features I am going to install. The place will be pretty 'raw' the rest of this year but the construction will be in place and ready for next year to be started on time.   I am adding a small pond for effect and for the wildlife. The herb garden will be distinct from the vegetable garden. The back bed of the vegetable garden (4'x40') will be set up for cutting flowers. Despite the mission of Frog Pond to be ""native"" in its plantings, a little fancy flowers make the place look nice!   New animals and birds were seen this week. Cedar wax-wings and killdeer are new to my sightings here. The hummingbirds are in full action at the feeder and the bird boxes are fledging nests. Summer is upon us at Frog Pond!   The first tomatoes are set on the vines in the garden and the beans are blossomed. The pumpkin vines are growing well and all in all things seem to be doing fine. A little rain this week would be nice.   "
2190,3596192,"10,June,2004",2004-06-10,"    Summer is here and is off to a roaring start. Everywhere there are plants growing and blooming, birds singing, and wildlife getting on with the business of life. The Father's Day hummingbird feeder went up yesterday and within 10 minutes, the Ruby-throated hummingbirds had found it.   There is not enough time to blog everything that goes through my mind about Frog Pond. Five minutes of sitting on the porch swing provides a lifetime of material to think about and write about. Fortunately, it is a lot more fun to get out in to the land and work with it as opposed to write about it! Maybe when the land sleeps this winter I can catch up on my writing...   Every day I fall more in love with this place. The pace and the connection with the land is so much more interesting that life in the city. Maybe I will never go back...   "
2191,3596192,"10,June,2004",2004-06-10,"    There are 15 bluebird boxes up at Frog Pond and today we took a long walk surveying them all. We found a little bit of everything; wrens in a couple boxes, tree swallows in others, and even some bluebirds! Most of the nests had eggs or chicks in them - it is the prime nesting season for most song birds.   One of the tree swallows was calm enough that we were able to pick her up off the nest and hold her. She was not thrilled with being handled but we were successful in getting her back on the nest without incident.   Need to create a little log of the boxes, conditions, and nests. One more thing for the web site!   "
2192,3596192,"10,June,2004",2004-06-10,"    One of the primary chores in front of us is to catalog the current flora and fauna at Frog Pond. We need to create some basic bio-survey in order to have a ""baseline"" of data. There is no need for this to be a scientific survey, but I think we will collect our notes in a variety of ways and keep reasonably accurate records.   Organizing the data will be a challenge. I believe we can start small databases; one for flora; one for birds; one for other fauna. The bird information is different enough from other data that it might merit its own database. On the other hand, if we begin to catalog insect life, that might create a new database need. All of this needs put on to the web site.   "
2193,3596192,"10,June,2004",2004-06-10,"    This is the opening post to this web log. It is our hope that the ideas here are of some value to the reader and that interested readers will share their experiences, questions, and feelings. Frog Pond is part of the world we all live in and this blog just might be a way to extend the community of Frog Pond beyond the traditional boundaries of geography.   "

2885,3599631,"12,June,2004",2004-06-12,"   So I got a  urlLink Gmail  account from  urlLink Fraser . So now you can send me an email at  urlLink jldera@gmail.com . However, my main email is still the one I'll read most often. Gmail seems like a nifty interface, we'll see how it works a bit.  "
2886,3599631,"11,June,2004",2004-06-11,"   So it used to be that  urlLink Google  was just a search engine. Now they keep coming out with all of these other cool technologies based on searching. For example,  urlLink Froogle  allows you to search the web for low prices on pretty much anything. Of course, this whole  urlLink Blogger  thing is Google-owned now.  The real fun, however, is over at  urlLink Google Labs . That's where you can find all the cool stuff before it comes out. It's like going to an auto show and seeing the concept cars that just never get to market. Though a lot of Google's stuff comes to bear. I've been using Froogle for a while, it just recently got onto the Google homepage.  A pretty neat tool over in the Labs is the  urlLink Web Alert  tool. I don't know about you, but I've been known to do some  urlLink egosurfing  every once in a while. With Google's Web Alerts, i don't have to do it by hand anymore. Instead, the  urlLink results  are emailed to me. A new item comes up, I get an email about it.  So now I'll know when someone is talking smack about me, without ever having to look for myself. Computers: making life easier since the 60's.  "
2887,3599631,"11,June,2004",2004-06-11,"   So, a little bit about myself. My name's Jason Deraleau. I'm in my mid 20's, 24 to be exact. I was born in the year of the Monkey and am a Gemini (at least, according to my  urlLink Blogger profile ). I live in western Massachusetts, which is located in the northeastern United States, which is located in the western hemisphere, which is located on the third planet from the sun, which is somewhere in a vast amount of void and matter known as the universe. You may have heard of it, you may not. I make no claims of knowing my audience.  I work with computers. I'm an IT administrator for a small business in Connecticut (somewhat south of that whole Massachusetts thing). My day to day involves managing several different servers of various operating systems. Going down the line, I have two running Windows 2000 Server, two running Mac OS X Server, one running Linux, and one running FreeBSD. I like to consider myself an equal opportunity OS employer. However, I honestly don't like Windows. I'd say I don't like Microsoft at all, but I have an Xbox and I have to admit it's a pretty good gaming system.  My true passion is for the Macintosh. While I would never have said such as recently as four years ago, in September of 2001 I bought my first Mac and I haven't looked back. I sometimes joke that Macs never existed before OS X, but I know that's not true. For example, I have an original Macintosh that has been hollowed out for use as a fish tank. There aren't any fish in it, mind you, because I can't seem to keep anything besides myself alive. I fear for my children, wherever they might be. Just kidding, I don't have any offspring. I think many people are thankful for that.  No, switching to the Mac was probably the smartest thing I've ever done. If I hadn't, I wouldn't have my current job, I wouldn't have written any  urlLink articles  for  urlLink O'Reilly , and I wouldn't be typing this on a beautiful 17"" Apple Studio Display. I think I've taken the whole Mac thing to an extreme though. I've become quite a hypocrite, but also quite an evangelist. I love to be proved wrong and for every bad thing I've said about Apple in the past, I'm sure I've said at least two good things about the Mac maker. And I have plenty more good things to say about Apple, the Mac, and other technology stuff, so stay tuned.  "
2888,3599631,"11,June,2004",2004-06-11,"   To be honest, I hate the word  blog . It just doesn't roll off the tongue very well. Blogggggggg. It's like saying blah, and we all know how dismissive  that  word is. In any case, I've signed up for  urlLink Blogger . Sure, part of it is to see if I get any  urlLink Gmail  invites, but I've been debating creating a more professional weblog that others can tune into.  Ya, I do have a personal  urlLink one  over at  urlLink LiveJournal . Plus I have  urlLink another  on the  urlLink O'Reilly Network . That one's pretty professional, but it's also pretty Mac-centric. As much as I love the Macintosh, I do keep up with other technologies and such. I don't update the ON one very often, either.  So here we are, gentle reader. Enjoy my musings!  "
21200,3599758,"29,June,2004",2004-06-29,"    The other day, I was thinking about my friend who had a problem with their friends.  This story is almost true but I just added it some of them that arent true but you will get the whole picture... Let me make up the names for this friends... Jason, Mike, and Matt. Jason is the young guy and Matt is pretty much older than Jason.  Mike is about between Jason's and Matt's ages.    Jason and Matt met each other last year and became roommate but they did have a fling for each other for short time.  About few months later, Jason met Mike and Jason really like Mike very much.  They were getting know each other more and of course, they ended up have a ""fling"" together.  Later on, Mike grew out of it with Jason and he just want to become a good friend with Jason.  Of course, Jason didnt like it very much but he had to accept it.  Mike already met Matt because they met each other through Jason.  One night, they (Jason, Mike, and Matt) went out to nightclub with other friends. Of course, NIGHTCLUB!? DRINK DRINK DRINK!!! Mike and Matt ended up dancing all night and hitted off very well... Jason noticed that Mike and Matt started to hung out more than before. Jason felt left out by them and he found this is very annoying.  Jason noticed that Mike shared with his experience with Matt than Jason and he felt that he's unimportant but Matt and Mike really like each other a lot and they really want more further but they cant because of Jason.  Jason really like Mike a lot and Matt felt in the middle because he also like Mike...  Somehow, Matt and Mike felt that they are prevented to go out because of Jason.     So, my question to you, If you're Jason...  Will you let them go even though if you really like Mike very much?     Let me share with my opinion, If I am Jason, Of course, I will be jealous about that because I happened to like Mike and my roommate ended up with Mike but it will take a while for me to let it go even its hard to hide my feeling not to show them how I felt about them. But think about it, what if Mike and Matt are suitable to each other like ""soulmate"".  One question that I want to ask you all, pretend this, if you really like this person and you both ended up had a good time and all that ""fling"" together then later on, this person dont want go more further with you and decided to be your friend but you really like him a lot and thought he's the ""ONE"". But you have to let it go and move on but this person ended up with your friend and they are pretty much along very well... But you dont like it very much and try to find a way to keep them apart... Will you do that? hmmm? Will you fight to get this person? so I'll leave it up to you all...   "
21201,3599758,"23,June,2004",2004-06-23,"    I just noticed that lately people dont really forgive to each other so easily and I was like? what the fuck? GROW UP!  So, I just want to express my feeling how I see people really forgive...  So I just looked up the dictionary.com and I pasted it:  forÂ·give    ( P )  Pronunciation Key  (fr-gv, fÃ´r-) v. forÂ·gave, (-gv) forÂ·givÂ·en, (-gvn) forÂ·givÂ·ing, forÂ·gives  v. tr. To excuse for a fault or an offense; pardon.  To renounce anger or resentment against.  To absolve from payment of (a debt, for example).   What is forgive means to you? I often forgive people a lot because if I dont forgive people, I often felt so tense and I really hate this feeling so why not just let it go and move on...  Of course, you can just forgive them but you might will not forget what they did to you... that is all, is that so simple? Maybe I'm wrong or they must have some reason why they refuse to forgive other people but I think you should forgive immendently...  Have you ever watch Queer as Folk last two sundays ago or something like that?  Deb (Michael's mom, the PFLAG mom), she said really harash to her brother, VIC, who has HIV poz.  She refused to apologize about what she said really harash on him.  Few days later, Vic died due to heart attack and Deb found out about that and she refused to forgive herself because she havent forgive him or apologize him so, its take a while for her to forgive herself.  My question to you? Can you tolerate that feeling if something happen to your friends or family members? SO, people, THINK! Also, why waste it? if my best friend and I been through a lot of shit happens, so we ended up not friends and refuse to forgive.  Why all the waste of years that we have been through? Can you just precious the friendship what you guys have been through? Hmmm?   I have several people who refused to forgive me what I've done to them but I was willing to talk with them out and clear it up but they refused to do that so I had to let it go because they hold the grudge or they have to much pride? I honestly cant see what's people's mind...  Yet, I forgive them and move on.    What's the wonderful feeling if you forgive these people fast, its really peace of mind and you dont have to think about how we do have to deal with.  Just forgive them immendently unless if you want to have a time then communicate this person that you want to have a time and will deal with them later when you feel ready...  Its soo easy to do that, really... AGREE???  I like this quote and I'm strongly support this, ""Communicate is a key to succeed""   My question to you, people, CAN YOU REALLY FORGIVE PEOPLE EASILY IF THESE PEOPLE REALLY HURT YOU?  PEOPLE, PLEASE THINK CAREFULLY...   "
21202,3599758,"11,June,2004",2004-06-11,"    Well well, HAWAI'I is soo awesome!   FABULIOUS!!!   Bradley Brown, David Fontes, and I flew to Hawai'i to see Bradley Dale aka Bray for our vacation but not for David cuz he will have a LONG vacation in Hawai'i! WHY? He's moving there to live with Bray as roommate (I miss David dearly and he's my best friend).  Well, Hawai'i, How can I really explain about Hawai'i...  hmmm, undescribable!! (if you really want to know about Hawai'i? then you need to join with us for New Year Eve.  We are working on going to hawai'i for nye)  When we landed on Oahu, HI and I told Bradley and David that not to expect to see luau girls to give us lei.  They were kinda disappointed about that and I told them,""GAWD! I guess you watch t.v. too much!"" so we laughed about it.  So finally, we met Ollie Luer, Bray's roommate (former boyfriend) and guess what? He gave us the leis! heh...     First, I don't want to confuse y'all.  If I said BRAY means Bradley Dale and Brad mean Bradley Brown.     Ollie took us to Bray's work at community college in hawai'i... He's teaching ASL there and I finally saw him since two years ago and was very exciting to see him again. David and Bray never met each other so they've been talking each other for like two years and FINALLY, they met!  (CHEER) We all went out to eat for dinner at cheesecake factory.  Brad, David and I were very TIRED! Hawai'i's time is like 9pm and DC time is like 3am! So, Brad, David and I looked like a SHIT!    During that week, We went out to the beach, looking around the island and all that... It was beautiful there!  Especially BEACH! There's a gay beach in waikiki, its called ""QUEEN'S SURF"" LOL! I KNOW! I KNOW! its soo gay! lol...    There's one thing I wanna tell you and I think this is cute one.  When we arrived and finally saw Bray.  Brad and I were puzzled to see him because his appearance and his clothing is not what we expected.  Remember this, Brad, Bray and I are ARIES!  Brad's birthday is on March 26th and Bray and I have same birthday, March 25th.  During that week, Brad let Bray borrowed his clothes and I had to fix his hair.  One night, I told Bray that he need to do something about his hair because its too PLAIN! Well, I have to admit that ARIES like to be FLAMY and we DONT like tooo plainly!  So Bray and I went to wal-mart and to get highlight kits and all that... Bray never had a highlight before so I have the cap on him so that way i can pull out to highlight on it...  He was kinda grumpy because its hurts!  Brad told Bray to SHUT UP AND ACCEPT! Bray was like, FUCK! and he has been patience for that!  I think its funny and then I added black tip on his hair so he has brown hair, blonde and little black on it...  HE LOOKED GREAT!  So the end of week, Brad and I looked at Bray and he looked GREAT!!!!  Brad and I looked each other and we said,""WE DID GOOD JOB!""     Few days before I went back to mainland.  Bray and I went to big island for one night as SISTER NIGHT.  Bray and I felt that we are soo SISTER (I know it's SO GAY! but SHUT UP!) We went into the plane decided to order wine and we were buzzed and we made a fun of some people (OOPS)...  When we landed Big Island from Oahu.  We rented convertible car and we felt so COOL at that moment...  We went to hotel and drop thing off and went out to eat resturant called,""Bumma Gump"". Forrest Gump resturant! heh...  After that, we went to gay bar and that's only gay bar in Big Island... Not a lot of people there so we just went ahead and ordered drinks... WE DRANK A LOT and we had a blast time...  Next day, we are supposed to go to see volocanoes but somehow we have a $$$ plm due to miscommunicate! it was really HELL!!! we were so grumpy and it was so hot outside and all that so I had to have David sent us some money through western union and waited for like five hours!!!  PAIN IN ASS! We couldnt go to see volocanoes so we decided to eat Hard Rock Cafe and check the beaches out and it was very interesting!  Then went back to Oahu.  BUT THOUGH, we had a good time!   There's one beach that I love to go... Its a local beach called waimea bay beach...  They have a cliff that we can jump into the ocean and I believe its like about up to 25 to 30 feet to jump from the cliff...  We checked a lot of CUTE guys there!  When I swam far from the land and I could see the below the ocean and its soo CLEAR!  So finally we took a rest and we all fell asleep for like 45 to one hour.  I woke up and its a perfect timing, we were watching sunset! it was soo beautiful!     Well, I have a lot of thing to tell you but this is one is good enuff for me to finish it but one more thing, when the day I have to go back to mainland, Bray and I were sad because we already miss each other and also I miss David too... I might wont see him until NYE.  It was very emotionally for me to leave like that but I wish David and Bray a best of luck in Hawai'i.     Well, that's all, FOLKS!  ALOHA!   "
21203,3599758,"10,June,2004",2004-06-10,"    BOY! Last night, my friends wanted me to go to green lantern/tool shed for a happy hour but I couldnt go out because I was too tired.  I decided to take a nap then go APEX instead of going to GL/TS.  SO I went there and had a good time!  I caught up the news with my friends because I was so busy all week from work.  Of course, I was really buzzed from 151 proof bacardi rum with pineapple juice.  so that's all about it last night, I dont really need to tell all the details about apex last night.   "

21205,3599758,"12,July,2004",2004-07-12,"    Sorry guys! its been a while ago!  I'm gonna tell you what did i do on lee's mini surprise birthday party and Jesse and Lee surprise birthday party...  On june 18th, Friday, Lee's 30th birthday...  The day before Lee's birthday party, I asked Scott and Emerson if we could throw a party for Lee and we agreed to do on celebrate his birthday...  So I emailed everyone to see if they could come over for his birthday. Some of them can make it to his birthday...  Next day, (on Lee's birthday) I left from work early and picked Emerson from work.  Chuck lived near Emerson's work so we picked him up and went home.  Chuck, Scott, Emerson and I are very HUNGRY...  we want to get something to eat for dinner so we decided to eat at wendy's...  Lee paged me and asked me if he could join with us because he was on his way to home to see us.  So, lee showed up and I could see him DRUNK! He was HUNGRY so I treated him for dinner...  I asked him where did he went and he said that he went out with jessy, jonelle and buck to swimming pool and had some drinks!  Lee told me that he only had three drinks and he's pretty much BUZZED! lol...  After that, Chuck joined with Lee to my place while Scott, Emerson and I went to Giant to get cake and beer...  I got people who paged me that they will come over.  Lee told me that he would go out tonight and I ordered him not to go out and he gave me his look that ""DONT TELL ME WHAT TO DO ON MY BIRTHDAY"". LOL! I covered up fast and I asked him what's in his mind for going out tonite and he has no clue about that...  So we went home and Cliff stopped by! YAY! Second guest came over!  We drank our beer in lee's bedroom and chat chat...  Of course there is something else we did but I'm not very comofortable to say in this blog!  Then the more people come by that surprised Lee very well... He didnt expected to see these people...  Scott listed this people on his blog so if you want to see who are those people went to his birthday party...  We stayed up until like 3am or something like that but it was BLAST!  So I asked Lee if he had a good time and he has this wide SMILE and his eyes were widen OPEN and he said YES!! HAD A BLAST TIME!  *25* (touch heart) Glad that he has a good time on his 30th birthday.... Chuck and I were discussing about having another party for lee because some people couldnt make it to his birthday party so would like to make up on his birthday...  I told Chuck that I would like to have a pool party and I asked chuck if he could find one for me and he gave me some optional!  Thanks CHUCK!!!!  He's very helpful!  Somehow, Lee told me that Todd (Jesse Conrad's partner) and Lee had been discussed about having a surprise birthday party for Jesse...   So, Chuck had to talk with Todd and share our plans...  Todd like the idea of the party so Todd, Chuck and I've been working on that for a week and made some plans for everyone...  Chuck found this public swimming pool in Laurel which is very nice!  They have four swimming pools, One is for toddlers' pool, the other one is 3 to 4 feet tall pool (the largest pools of all), Two of them is deepest one, one is like 6 feet tall and other one is 12 feet tall for diving board and slide...  We only need to pay like 5.25 dollars from 1pm to 8pm, not bad!?!? On July 2nd, Gabe and Allan were on their road to baltimore from Philly...  They met me at my work to check out my office but unfortunetly, my office will be move soon! Ill explain the next blog!  FOCUS FOCUS ON PARTIES! (*GIGGLE*) After that, Allan decided to joined with me to pick Emerson up while Gabe followed me...  After I picked Emerson up, we went home and kicked back at my place... Of course, we did a bit party in our place in the afternoon...  I ended up really tired and went to bed early like 10pm while some of them want to go out SECRET...  AJ came over too...  CHADIVA moved to d.c. from louisana due his personal problem but welcome back!  (Chadiva is very happy to be here in d.c. check his blog..)   On July 3rd, We woke up like 11ish in the morning and we have to get ready to go swimming pool but I had to go to store and buy the cake...  AJ went to store with me because I dont want Lee to come with me but ended up Lee asked me if he could join with us and I was like SHIT!  But didnt want him to suspect anything so i had to let him to join with me...  Went to Giant to buy bigger CAKE!  Todd asked me if we could add spongebob on it so we did.  Lee suggested that we should add ""HAPPY BIRTHDAY JESSE"" and AJ and I looked each other and we smiled but I told him that I just want to be SIMPLE ""HAPPY BIRTHDAY"" so Lee was puzzled about it but he just not really noticed something fishy but he went along with us!  So, I asked people to meet me at my place at noonish...  I'm gonna list who are those people went with us to the swimming pool. Lee Masa (ME!) Emerson Scott Jesse Todd Chuck Jeff AJ Allan Gabe Imran Chadiva Troy Jessy Jonelle Sara Victor Rene Renato Some of them will meet us at the pool...  After that, I had to meet Chuck since I dont know where is it so Lee and I had to meet Chuck then Chuck led us there to pool...  So, when we arrived, Jesse forgot to bring his swimming short but he did brought it but left in the car.  He joined with Lee to the swimming pool, he forgot to took it with him! LOL! Jesse begged Todd if he could give him a ride to store to buy new short! POOR JESSE! FINALLY, everyone showed up and I had to get everyone's attention. I said that we have some announcement..  I thanked for everyone to showed up and all that and the reason why we were here for two persons is LEE AND JESSE!  They both were surprised about it!  So after that, we swam and play around..  OF COURSE!  We are too expose to everyone at the public pool but it was a lot of FUN!  After that, we decided to go to TGIF and we ordered our dinner and something to drink! OH BOY! we were BUZZED! After the dinner, there is more people show up at my place, Cliff showed up and so do Derrick.  There is more people showed up but I couldnt remember who.  We had to get ready for Velvet Nation.  Before we went to VN, we served the cake and Lee and Jesse were surprised about it but Jesse were puzzled about spongebob thing on the cake and I told Jesse that Todd requested me to add spongebob on it because Todd mentioned me that Jesse didnt really like spongebob! lol...  No one wanted to eat cake because all they want to DRINK AND GET FUCK UP! So we all went to velvet nation, of course, you guys all know what Velvet Nation is all ABOUT!  We went there to FUCKED OURSELVES UP!  We bumped into Buck and his friend, Victor...  Billy showed up later, Terese showed up with her friend, Ruben...  We had a blast time together and after that, we decided to go home and kick back because we were still ALIVE.  Some people wanna join with us to kick back so they came over and we chat chat chat chat! Lee didnt show up until 830am.  Some people left and some of us were staying... We ended up play the playing cards called ""PHASE TEN""... Its a lot of FUN!  but we stayed up until like 10 to 11am and I was SOO FUCKING TIRED!  so went to bed while emerson woke up! lol...  I slept until like 4pm. So that day is on july 4th, we went to CMRA cookout on 4th of july!  CMRA were surprised that I rvsp'ed 20 people for 4th of july cookout...  So its a lot of fun!  We just relaxed and watching the fireworks after that went back home and we were lazy! lol! it was a good time!  I asked Jesse and Lee if they had a blast time and they said YES!!!  Had a wonderful time!  So that's what we did!  heh...   "
19691,3600967,"21,June,2004",2004-06-21,"   Sunday was Father's Day and we geared up for a fantabulous day outside.  It was perfect weather, 80 degrees, bright blue sky and we had a terrific day planned.  Just before we left I read my mother's Father's Day sermon which was eloquent and sweet and moved me to tears (check it out at:http://reverendpat.blogspot.com ).  She wrote of her Uncle Ernie and revealed more about him to her congregation than she's ever shared with me personally.  My mother's family all died before my brother and I ever came on the scene (except for Ernie who we only met once) and they all carry this mythical mystique.  I only know them in stories that are pieced together that don't form cohesive wholes.  And since I only know them through my mother's eyes I always wonder what I would have seen or which of their personalities I would have encountered.  For as with any mysterious character, they all have glamorous qualities, scary dark ones, and lots of shadows.  Uncle Ernie used to send us cards on our birthdays.  Cards with crisp new bills in them.  Usually a dollar but I remember getting $5.  He never wrote notes and there was never news.  Just the new money and ""Love, Uncle Ernie"".  It was like magic for me, getting those cards on my birthday.  Like getting a gift from the beyond almost.  He was such a ghost to me in many ways.  When I met him I was 13 and there's really no way for me to describe what it was like.  I suppose I had all these dreams and fantasies in my heart about what he meant to me and how much I thought he was this magical leprechaun kind of creature.  And since I was extremely shy and extraordinarily self-conscious at 13, I had no way to really express any of that to him.  So I mumbled and looked at my feet and ran off to play as soon as I could and felt entirely trapped by my age and awkwardness.  And it was strange to meet him face to face, like seeing a unicorn almost.  In a way, it wasn't supposed to happen.  I can only hope he enjoyed it.  I know I did but I'll always feel as though I wasn't quite good enough.  And that he would see I didn't deserve all those nice cards he sent.  My Mom's sermon is about Uncle Ernie being an extraordinarily kind man.  And let me share with you this quote:   ""Spirituality is often about doing the tiny work of God, little acts, small responses to God's presence in our lives.  Spiritual people are about tiny things, which is the fruit of their spirituality.  The spiritual life is not a life of success; it is a life of faithfulness.  God does big things once in a while, but there is no question that the primary work of God in the world is tiny.  God knew we would naturally be dazzled by big.  That's why Jesus told the parables of the lost sheep, the lost coin, the lost son, the mustard seed.  The small, seemingly insignificant acts we do in the name of Jesus Christ don't seem very impressive to us, but they can make a big difference in people's lives.  Acts of habitual kindness can generate stability, unity and wholeness in a community.""  And to my mother, Uncle Ernie, her father figure, embodied this spirituality.  This got me thinking of course.  And since I pride myself on being the kind of person who is kind to strangers I start to feel pretty darn good about myself and about how indeed I am a spiritual person living out my faith in small measure.  Yes sirree I'm just small enough to be relevant to God.  So Mikie has a soccer game on Father's Day and since he loves to play soccer Collin and I happily join him.  Luckily he was playing at a field that has a playground attached.  So Collin and I set up camp at the playground while Mikie plays soccer.  When I say we happily join him....let me clarify that this is a choice I make for Father's Day.  Honestly the idea of keeping Collin entertained at the park for 2 hours during his nap time is not that exciting of a prospect.  And had it been an ordinary Sunday I would have sent Mikie off to play while Collin napped at home.  But since it was Father's Day, and luckily a gorgeous day, we joined Mikie.  And quite frankly, in spite of it all, I'm glad we did and I would do it again.  But it's important to note that I am just a little frazzled and anxious at how it's all going to go.  So no sooner than we arrive and Collin heads up the stairs to the ""Slide! Slide! Slide!"" do we meet Roman.  Roman is 7, well, he'll be 7 in just 3 months.  3 months is his math, he'll actually be 7 in 2 months, August 31 to be precise.  Roman is a talker.  At first we merely exchange pleasantries, he actually says, ""Good afternoon"" which is charming.  We go over all our names.  He has me guess both his middle name and his last name.  He then wants to guess mine and Collin's names.  Then he wants me to guess his nickname, then he wants to guess our nicknames.  Then he just wants to chat.  Well, it's a nice day and he seems a little like a lost soul (they always know where to find me) so we strike up a chat.  Except also remember I have a responsibility to Collin who is busy on new playground equipment so I'm sort of torn between the two of them.  I'm getting a glimpse at what it's like to have two kids and it scares the hell out of me.   And then Roman just keeps talking.  And talking and talking and talking.  I'm wondering to myself where this kid's parents are and I start looking around.  He eventually tells me he's there with his grandma who is busily chatting away with one of her friends on a park bench.  And I am torn between the desire to be God's servant and the desire to tell this kid to shut up so I can enjoy my own child.  I take deep breaths, focus in on Collin and remember a challenge from my mother's sermon, ""Listen to the neighbor kid's troubles instead of saying, 'Get lost.'...Usually giving our life to Christ isn't glorious. It's done in all those little acts of love, 25 cents at at time.""  I resolve myself to be good and ask more probing questions.  I come to discover that Roman has 1 sister and 2 brothers, all of whom live in Ukraine.    ""So who do you live with here?"" I ask.   ""THAT is not a good question..."" he replies with all the 7 year old seriousness he can muster.  So I learn even more about Roman while Collin is looking around wondering where his mother is and why she's talking to this kid instead of sliding.  Roman's had it kind of rough.  He's ""trying out"" his third Dad.  The first one was greedy and the second one was mean and bad.  This one is OK but he's the laziest according to Roman.  There are stories of abuse and stories of neglect.  It's obvious the kid carries a painful load.  And to help him cope I guess he talks.  And talks and talks.  And I spend a good deal of time really investing in Roman, encouraging him, asking for details, telling him he's great and smart and a very mature kid.  He apologizes for having to say a bad word.  But he just has to use the word ""stupid"".  Again he apologizes after he says it.  But it  is  just stupid that the community center wants to charge $72 for only 15 basketball games when swimming is free.  I told him it was OK to use stupid in that context and that I agreed with him.  I also told him I appreciated that he's very careful about that bad word.  And then I had several ooey gooey moments where I looked lovingly out at the soccer field and at my sweet Collin and said Amens and Hallelujahs that my life is so much more simple than poor dear Roman's.  I started to feel as though Roman was there for me, as a little kick start of gratitude.  Stop your whining and anxiousness and give thanks that Collin only has one Dad who is neither greedy, mean, bad or lazy.  And if Collin wants to play basketball, stupid or not, we'd easily pay the money.  So I had nothing but misty eyes for Roman for a while.  And Collin was enjoying his company.  And really, it was so nice out.  It was turning out to be quite a good day.  And then Roman just kept talking and Collin was getting more demanding.  Collin needed to eat but he was all dirty so trying to clean him and offer him food that he would eat and all that jazz while Roman was busy chatting away was distracting and nerve producing.  It was hard to interrupt Roman and speak to Collin, I mean, I wanted to be present to this poor kid and make him feel special.  But at the expense of my own sanity and my own kid?  It started to get a little tricky.  Where was this grandmother anyway?  And there were plenty of other people at the park, couldn't someone else entertain Roman for a while?  Once Collin downed his sand covered banana and his energy was restored for more exploring, we headed back to the jungle gym and Roman began to recount to me all the details of the SERIES of books his teacher read to them this year.  And you know 7 year olds are not the best story tellers.    ""So Annie, she's King Arthur's sister.  You know King Arthur?  Well, she's King Arthur's sister.  Well King Arthur's sister's sister.  And she, um, Annie, the sister, she has a friend Jack.  And Annie, her sister, King Arthur's sister's sister, she made this house.  This magic treehouse.  And when they want to come back they just get in and it spins and spins and then there they are.  And this one time, Annie, she went to the dinosaur times.""  And on and on.  My head is now officially aching and I'm getting angry at this kid for wasting my time and distracting me with this  drivel !  Then I remembered something I read recently from Pamela Anderson in Jane magazine.  She talks about positive energy and surrounding yourself with positive energy.  And paying attention to the people you're with, do they give you positive energy or are they ""energy vampires"".  And it hits me like a ton of bricks that Roman is an energy vampire.  I'm giving all my energy away to this little blood sucker and I'm so stressed and frustrated about it that I'm cranky and miserable.  And totally unavailable for my child and husband.  I'm giving all of myself away to this stranger who is draining me so I'm now empty for Mike and Collin.  It seems like the only thing to do is to just distance from Roman, to start ignoring him and paying more attention to Collin.  So Collin and I go down the slide together which delights him so we do it ""again"" and ""again"" and ""again"".  Roman, sensing my separation, now asks for me to play tennis with him.  I explain that I need to keep a closer eye on Collin and he still persists, ""we can play in the grass"" he says pleadingly.  Those innocent eyes looking so hopeful.  I apologize and keep sliding with Collin.  The guilt is nagging at me.  I'm having internal wars about whose religion I'm going to follow my mother's or Pamela Anderson's!  The choice seems strangely ironic to me as they both seem utterly opposite and utterly attractive at the same time.    Where the hell is his grandmother?  Occasionally she comes over and speaks to him in  hushed, not so friendly Ukrainian.  But for the most part, she has left him to me.  I start to wonder if she always does this.  He did say he's at this park every day.  He explains to me that he forgot the popsicles and that he's really upset because they are going to be here all day and it's so hot out.  This is when I realize, Roman is not going anywhere soon.  I'm still dancing between ignoring him and playing with him when he starts to ask me to reach a tree branch for him so he can climb the tree.  I tell him I can't and suggest he ask his grandma, to do it.  He won't do that.  I realize of course he wants me to do something for him that he shouldn't do so I say I won't and sorry and all that jazz.  There is a tornado of guilt and obligation and woe and empathy and frustration and hatred inside me.  I keep trying to breathe deeply and ""appreciate"" the blue sky and the nice shade of the park but it's no use.  My anxious insides are wearing me out.  What would Uncle Ernie do I wonder?  I know the answer of course and I feel I've failed him once again.  The whistle finally blows to stop the game and I scoop Collin up, announce that we're leaving, say a quick and kind good bye to Roman and march off to the field for some relief in Mikie.  And wouldn't you know, as we're leaving the field heading for the car, who is heading home from the park?  Roman with Grandma in tow.  He wants to know which way we are walking, maybe we could join them.  ""We're going in the car"" I say, ""we live far from here.""  ""Oh."" he says with obvious disappointment.  And while I said pleasant good byes and was as nice as I was able, I can't help but feel I let him down.  People are always letting Roman down I guess.  In the end I didn't really choose either religion.  Just my often practiced and ever faithful tension and anxiety.  And the hope that I'll be out of this situation as soon as possible.  "
19692,3600967,"17,June,2004",2004-06-17,"   We had the pleasure this week of experiencing our neighborhood pool.  We are fortunate enough to live in the Chicago area where people take summer seriously.  We've been indoors all winter and we get outdoors all summer.  The city is bursting with fun and exciting things to do.  Our ""neighborhood pool"" is basically a water park.  Water playground is its official name and man they ain't kidding.  This place is awesome!  They have a super huge pool with lots of shallow water, 2 HUGE inner tube water slides for the big kids, and a groovy little play area for the small ones.  We naturally were in the groovy little area for the small ones.  Imagine a huge climbing structure in the middle of a shallow pool with a zillion little fountains and things.  At the top are two different water slides which we can go on with Collin.  At the very top of the structure is one of those giant buckets that fills with water and periodically splashes down on the entire area with tremendous force.  OK, so that's what it is.  Now let me tell you that last night we went to the pool after Collin's nap, we arrived about 5:00pm.  Let me also tell you that it is mid June.  Being from Texas, mid June is HOT.  Chicago has slightly cooler weather and we were a little nervous to arrive at the pool and find it not quite warm out, but not quite cold either.  We try to divert Collin's attention with hanging out in the warmish shallow end of the giant beach like pool.  Neither of us was really into getting truly wet.  But he wanted to head for the slides so we followed him over there.  Let me tell you, that water is COLD.  Like teeth chattering cold. This did not deter our son however and he started for the slides right away.  In order to do that he of course had to climb up through all the cold spraying water.  And since he's 20 months old we decided parental supervision was in order.  OK, that's the setup, here's the pitch.  You know how when you're faced with something cold splashing on you, you brace yourself, duck for cover and do whatever you can to cover yourself from the water?  Well, my instincts were right on the money and I did just that.  Except, what I used to cover myself from all this splashing was Collin!  I didn't really realize it until we got to the top of the stairs and he is sputtering and shaking and trying to get the water off of his face.  It was one of those brilliant parenting moments let me tell you.  Fortunately, it didn't seem to bother him much and I made adjustments.  We went down the slide ""again"" and ""again"".  Poor Collin was shaking and his little teeth were chattering but his smile never faded.  And Mikie and I freezing and shivering ourselves had one of those united front parenting moments I just love.  I turned to him and said, ""You know this is one of those times when you know just how much you love your kid.""  His chipper response, ""That's right, we can't ruin his fun.""  And I just smiled at this amazing man, so appreciative of the tremendous effort he and I were happily making for our boy.  "

19694,3600967,"10,June,2004",2004-06-10,"   So my husband is a bit of a Star Wars freak.  Not the dress up as a character and go to conventions kind (although he has been to a convention or two) but worse than that - he is the collecting kind.  Oh yes, you read that right.  He collects Star Wars stuff.  He has a room, a Star Wars room, of all things.  And it's filled with toys and books and comics and posters and various other Star Wars merchandise.  An entire wall filled with toys in pristine condition from all the new movies.  Oh sure he has stuff from the olden days, stuff his parents weren't smart enough to throw away (he would say they were smart enough NOT to throw it away), but mostly he has the new stuff.    I'm not quite sure where this collecting addiction stems from but he's got it bad.  And of course he's kind of a snob about it so you can't really get him anything.  He's got this bizarre and mysterious criteria for what's cool that only he knows.  He started collecting when the re-releases happened.  He was fresh out of college and flush with Wall Street cash and before you could say ""May the Force be with you"" his passion for the movies became a passion for collecting.    Now where do I fit in to all of this?  I began to see early on that this childish joy was so pure that I really didn't want to be the mean old witch getting in the way of things so I decided to accept it lovingly.  Wasn't that nice of me?  I assumed it wouldn't last forever.  Well, it's gone on way longer than expected and quite frankly he should be lucky the house is big enough and we don't need that room.  Of course I have days when I wonder, ""Hey, what about my room?""  I suggested painting the the laundry room pink and making it all girly just for me but then that depressed me.  I'd really rather not hang out there thank you very much.    Anyway, my husband has this R2D2 robot that he got from his parents last Christmas.  (Yes, they still purchase toys for their son even though he's in his 30's.  Trust me, they too think it is weird but they are those wonderful super love kind of parents who would do nothing to stand in the way of their son's happiness.  That and really, what the hell else is there to get?)  And now he is using this Star Wars character robot with our son (20 month old Collin).  Well not surprisingly, Collin thinks it is really cool.  And I think they are adorable, the three of them playing together; Mikie giving commands, R2 making these weird electronic noises, and Collin doing his happy dance.    But when Mikie isn't at home Collin points at the thing and says, ""R2! R2!"" and looks at me expectantly wanting me to give it commands to make it dance and sing those mechanical ""songs"".  Well I don't know how the thing works and to be frank, I don't really want to know.  Knowing sends me much farther down the Star Wars path than I am willing to go.  And really now, don't you think I'm far enough already?  (Remember the room people.)    But when that sweet boy starts to get frustrated and throw a terrible two tantrum over it (yes, he is ahead of his age thank you for noticing) I wonder if it's worth it just to know a few things.  But then I remember ""diversion"" and Collin and I play with good old fashioned wooden puzzles instead.  And then we'll read some books or sing some songs.  I'll let Daddy be the one to teach him all about Star Wars.  I'll let it be their little bonding thing.  Just look for me in the rosy pink laundry room.  "
19695,3600967,"14,July,2004",2004-07-14,"   We recently enjoyed a visit from the MIL and she requested we go to Ravinia one night.  Since Mikie and I both LOVE Ravinia we were happy to oblige.  Ravinia, for those of you who don't know, is one of Chicago's most impressive treasures.  Ravinia is a place, a state of mind, an event, a world all into itself.  Basically, from Memorial Day to Labor Day Ravinia, an outdoor music arena, hosts a variety of concerts from jazz to pop to classical.  As it is the summer home of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, classical is the predominant musical medium.  We decided to attend Saturday night's concert.  This season the symphony is featuring the works of Rachmaninoff and we were thrilled to learn that Saturday night, the symphony would play Rhapsody on a Theme by Paganini.  I'm no classical snob.  I basically like the stuff I've heard before.  I enjoy all types of classical, but the songs I love are the ones that are familiar tunes.  Usually made familiar by commercials and elevator music.    So I was thrilled when I learned that I would actually know some of the music.  Not only that, I do love that Rhapsody on a Theme.  You know the one.  It goes like this:  Da da da da dum Da da da Dum Da da da da dum La da da dum  And on and on.  Typically an evening at Ravinia is one of elegant sophistication and romance.  It's a giant picnic under the stars where people bring fancy little tables and place settings, everyone sets up candles, has wine and cheese and gourmet snacks.  Presentation matters.  The woman at the table next to us brought a hurricane lamp and surrounded it with fresh flowers.  This gives you an idea of the lengths people go to to make this a special occasion.  And it is special, magical even.  There's nothing quite like live classical music played by a world class symphony.  But instead of being crammed in an uncomfortable seat wearing shoes that are too tight, you are in your most comfortable (yet stylish) outfit, lying on your back looking at the stars.    OK, so imagine a 21 month old thrown into the mix whose bedtime is right around the start of the show.  Wondering how this is going to go?  So were we....  On the drive up we had lots of conversations about setting expectations.  I made it clear that we shouldn't force Collin to do anything.  That if we let him drive the bus in terms of walking, standing, sitting, strolling, whatever it would keep him quiet and happy and we would all enjoy the evening much better.  Quiet is important at Ravinia.  There's no talking during the performance.  They even have noise police in khaki pants and Ravinia golf shirts walking around with signs asking people to be quiet.  So we were a little on edge about keeping Collin quiet.  And of course we can feel the tension of the people around us wondering when this toddler was going to explode and ruin their Ravinia experience.  Well he did make a noise.  But he only endeared himself to his fellow music lovers when he did it.  You know how in a big symphonic piece there is a slight pause between movements?  A hush so you can linger in the last moment of the first section before they thrill you with the next?  Well it was during this hush that Collin broke into applause and shouted ""Yay!""  We were the proud recipients of many warm giggles and stares after that.  For the most part, Collin decided that Ravinia is best enjoyed on foot.  He circled the entire complex several times and we spent countless minutes going over the same steps and ramps and trips to see the train and the potty.  As there were three adults there it was just perfect.  One adult was always up and completely focused on Collin, his ideal.  And then two were left to enjoy each other's company back at our base camp of our blanket, chairs, snacks, and bottles of wine.    I don't mind admitting that sometimes when I'm on Collin duty it feels much more like a chore than play.  Especially when it's the weekend and I feel stuck doing the job I do all week.  It's just like if you had to go into the office on a Saturday.  I can't explain why I have that feeling and I wish I didn't but I do.  But not at Ravinia.  I'm not sure if it was the music or the wine (probably a little of both) but we both had the most amazing time.  Collin was running around in his pajamas (we had brief delusions that he would go night night under the stars) looking like the happiest kid on the planet and he easily switched partners when one of us needed a break and never lost his happy grin.    I was off duty when the Rhapsody came on and I thought we made a mistake.  I didn't see how this song would eventually become the famous tune I was hoping to hear.  And then gradually I began to hear that it might and I was switching over to ""Collin duty"" when it started.  Well, I was in heaven!  Collin and I danced in circles to the music.  I couldn't contain myself.  It was the most exciting and glorious sound I had ever heard.  My feet HAD to dance.  And I was glad to have Collin in my arms both because I love him so much and because he gave me full permission to be as bold of a dancer as possible.  (Had I not been with Collin I might have danced anyway and that would be the thing that inspired Mr. D. to start his own blog....)  When certain music plays that leads me to dance, it's as though it is the natural extension of the swells in my heart.  Classical music always makes me yearn for the stage.  And Collin giggled and twirled right along with me.  Still too young to roll his eyes and be embarrassed by his mother.  Rather he was looking at me with pure adoration.  After our big number we headed over to the stairs where we played with Isaac.  He had one of those ""be careful"" Moms and I felt sorry for her.  Collin and I had a ball playing with her child and she was so anxious and self conscious that she couldn't really let go and have fun.  ""He just gloms on to people"" she said in an exasperated and apologetic tone.  ""That's fine! How cute!"" I yelled back as I chased both boys back up the ramp.  I could have played with them all night but she was getting uncomfortable (to her credit she was pregnant and I forgive a pregnant lady for anything) and Collin was ready to move to the next big thing.  The train!  Collin has a passion these days for trains.  And the Metra, Chicago's commuter railway has a stop right at the Ravinia gates.  So wouldn't you know it, just after we left Isaac and his Mom and we were near the front gate I saw that the Ravinia staff was preparing for the arrival of the train.  So Collin and I parked ourselves behind a fence and waited for the train to arrive.  ""Here it comes, here it comes!"" he kept saying.  ""Oooohhhh, a train! A train!"" he shouted over and over as it pulled into the station, looking at me as if he couldn't believe his luck.  ""Bye bye train!  Bye bye train!"" he said and waved as it left.  With a twinkle in his eye he shared with me a conspiratorial smile as if just the two of us had seen a pot of gold at the end of a rainbow.  Next we were off to the potty, one of Collin's other new passions.  We're potty training in full force now.  But this trip Collin didn't want to go potty himself ""No"" he just hung around with me in the stall occupying himself with all the delights of the toilet paper and flushing and the little trash can.  I started our adventure in the stall by getting out a liner for the bowl.  Just as I was about to put it on the seat I thought better of it and decided to give that one to Collin to play with, undress a little bit, then put mine on the seat and pull-down-sit-down in one swift motion so he wouldn't steal my liner.  Well wouldn't you know he took the liner and placed it perfectly on the seat just like my own personal potty valet.  And then he quietly amused himself with toilet paper which he then handed me when I was ready.  I was beside myself with the bounty of my good fortune.  It's not that Collin isn't a good kid, he's actually a really good kid.  But keep in mind it is about 9:30pm and he is still in excellent spirits and blissfully happy and well behaved.    His Nannie, as he calls his grandmother, was on Collin duty when Mikie and I decided it was time to go.  We packed up our little site and looked out over the crowd searching for Collin and Nannie.  It was such a beautiful sight.  Silent reverence for the beautiful music, candle light, the twinkling of the stage lights in the distance, 16 stars in the darkening sky.  We didn't spot Collin but sure enough, when there was a pause from one movement to the next we heard his familiar ""Yay!"" and those little hands clapping and we knew just where to go.  "

I've just got an email message, informing me that  urlLink The Attendee Web site  is up and running. It took me nearly two hours just to prepare an  alpha  version of my schedule. For those of you, who haven't done that so far, I suggest you to do that as soon as possible, since it might be far more time consuming than you think. Yeap, there are zillions of different sessions you can choose from and mostly all of them extremely interesting.  Again, there is one more blog article that I would suggest you to check. It's  urlLink Tim Sneath's article  with a short list of tips for making the most out of the TechEd.  Here's the list of sessions, that I will probably attend at:    Visual Studio 2005 and SQL Server 2005 : Exciting New Roadmap To The Future   Visual Studio 2005 & SQL Server 2005 : Come get the details on an exciting new product announcement!   Visual Basic 2005 : RAD Development for the VB Developer   eXtreme Programming: the alternative way to building high quality systems   Visual Basic 2005 : Language Enhancements   SQL Server 2005: .NET Framework-Based Programming in the Database   SQL Server 2005: What's New in Replication   .NET and Diagnostics   Visual C# 2005 : IDE Enhancements for the C# Developer   Visual Basic: Tips and Tricks for Optimizing Your Applications   FrontPage 2003: Designing Customized SharePoint Services and Sites   RAD Data Access with Visual Studio 2005 â€“ the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly   ASP.NET: Best Practices for Performance   .NET Architecture Clinic   Migrating ADO to ADO.NET   SQL Server 2005: Web Services   ASP.NET: Tips and Tricks for Building Server Controls   Windows Forms: Controls Tips and Tricks    I will probably be changing this list thoughout this two weeks before the grand beginning of the TechEd.

17486,3601621,"11,June,2004",2004-06-11,"    Right now I'm dealing with the following TechEd related dilema: to bring a laptop or not?   I've found an interesting blog post by Bill Evjen who has prepared  urlLink list of things that one should bring to TechEd . I know it's been originaly written for the San Diego TechEd Event, but I guess it doesn't really matter as they're probably all pretty much the same (my guess though).  I've never been to TechEd before, so I was just wondering about the  laptop  thing. I'm not quite yet sure either I will get a laptop (don't have one of my own yet) by that time or not. So I was thinking: will you guys have your own laptops as well or not. And why? Thanks for your comments (if I get any ;)).  Other than that, I do completely suggest anyone who hasn't seen Bill Evjen's list yet, to follow  urlLink this link  and check it out - I found it extremely informative and especially loved his suggestions such as the one related with the business cards and writting messages on the backs of them.

17487,3601621,"10,June,2004",2004-06-10,"    Yupee. This is my first blog post. I must say that a few months ago I didn't have any idea what blogs are and would probably completely dissagree with anyone saying that I will have one of my own someday. Since the last couple of weeks I have come to the conclusion that it would be worth to try having my own blog where I would discuss things that I love and have passion for.  Therefor I have decided to discuss my work and things that are related to it one way or another. There are definately two subjects that I will be dealing with in the near future...first is  urlLink my own HTML editor  (which is now getting completely rewritten from VB6 code into the VB.NET and C# code) and the second is the  urlLink Microsoft's TechEd event in Amsterdam .  As it goes for the TechEd event, I hope I will be able to share my reflections from the event with the rest of you and give at least some useful information about some of the interesting stuff where I will attend at. And as for the HTML editor goes: most of all, I hope you will be able to give me some useful comments and suggestions throughout the process of developing, which will help me accomplishing the goal of creating a user-friendly and innovative HTML editor using the latest Microsoft's development tools.  I guess I should also tell you a bit more about myself at this point: I am a student in Ljubljana, Slovenia (which is one of the new EU member countries), but usualy spend most of my time developing all sorts of software. One of the major projects, that I have actually started years ago, is  urlLink my own HTML editor  that I have mentioned before and will be the source of many discussions here. Besides that I have one lovely 21 months old daughter with my lovely girlfriend that are together truly the greatest source of joy and fun for me right now! Photos of both of them will be posted somewhere in my blog soon...  Okay...that's it for now...it's 2a.m. here and I guess it's time for me to go to bed. Good night everyone, and read/write you soon!   "

25700,3602089,"10,June,2004",2004-06-10,"   Today, I attended the Laurel Festival once again that is held every year in Wellsboro, Pennsylvania.  On ""The Green"" they have many tents full of people selling neat trinkets, hand-carved woodwork, lawn-decorating pieces, tye-dyed clothes, and hundreds of other unique products.  I bought two dollars worth of marbles which appealed to me...especially the orange and white ones that look like cream/dreamsicles.  In the north section of ""The Green"" are approximately fifteen food stands; They have everything you can imagine...german bratwurst, greek gyros, candy apples, mongolian noodles, old-fashioned orangeade, bloomin' onions, sausage, meatballs, cheesesteak, pie, pierogies, cheesecake, chicken sandwiches, and other exotic food stands.  This was the list of my ""gastric-hoardings"" from today in order of first to last eaten from 1pm to 5pm...  1.)  Old-Fashioned Lemonade 2.)  Half of a funnelcake 3.)  A huge strawberry shortcake (real strawberries, real biscuits, and really       rich, buttery, whipped topping) 4.)  Greek potato salad - perfectly cooked warm-ish olive-oiled potatos with       leaves/flakes of parsley and pepper 5.)  Old-Fashioned Lemonade  I am kicking myself now because I decided against buying some oriental mongolian noodles for fear of barfing near the ""marble tent"".  I will just have to wait until next year.  As I listen to the news they are talking about ""Bill Clinton's Autobiography: My Life""...haha...what a freaker...And for DINNER (7:30pm), dad made a delicious bbq chicken sandwich with pepperjack cheese, garlic, and romaine, all on a plain flour bun...  "
25701,3602089,"10,June,2004",2004-06-10,"   I had so many carbs and calories yesterday...420 calories worth of chocolate milk, a whole bread stick and huge slice of lasagna, a clearly canadian blackberry soda, a whole basket full of french fries, a bbq sandwich w/ two slices of white bread, four twizzler sticks (all flour and corn starch), and two slim jims.  I felt so sick...but now, today, I am hungry.  I think, perhaps, I should go on a forty-day fast and not eat anything.  Fasts are quite healthy, because, at any given moment, your body is carrying five to ten pounds of toxins and other bad things.  Fasting releases these harmful byproducts of your body making you healthier.  I'm nost sure which DVD I want to watch tonight... either Office Space, Fantasia 2000, Behind Enemy Lines, or The Others.  Everyone told me it was going to be a nice day when I knew it was going to be crappy.  I woke up to ugly skies but now it is sunny...wtf is going on?!  I believe that the events that take place in the movie ""The Day After Tomorrow"" are not too far in the future from occurring.  We have all of these screwed up weather patterns that do not necessarily follow anything that we've seen in the past.  Barcodes are awesome... www.upcdatabase.com is my website of the day. I'm out...  "
25702,3602089,"10,June,2004",2004-06-10,"   Today was filled with restlessness as I struggled to find other things to occupy the hours.  I got up approx. at 10:25am and started taping Ronald Reagen's funeral for my mom at 10:37am...it had started at 10am.  I got online to see if my friend in Niedersachsen (Dissen, to be specific), Germany, was on or ÐšÑƒÑ€Ð¾Ñ‡ÐºÐ¸Ð½Ð¾ ÐÐ°Ð´ÐµÐ¶Ð´Ð° Ð¡ÐµÑ€Ð³ÐµÐµÐ²Ð½Ð°, my friend in St. Petersburg, Russia.  Neither were on but I chatted with my mom who was at work at the courthouse.  I finished watching the commentary version of ""The Craft"" on DVD, which is one of my favorite movies of all time!  I tried renaming and reorganizing my mp3s that i had to transfer from my iPod to my new computer hardrive which will be a strenuous task, seeing as how the names somehow change in the transfer process... I really wish there were a Starbucks within at least 30 minutes of here.  There are three in one city an hour from here which is not fair.  The one-pound-burrito restaurant, Chipotle: there is not one in the whole grand state of Pennsylvania.  I had one while in Baltimore on a field trip and it was extremely tasty.  OH DAMN!  I forgot that the stand up comedians on on tonight!...hmm...I hope I'm not missing any good ones!...My condolences go out to Nancy and the rest of the Reagan family...he truly was a compassionate human being.  "
25703,3602089,"10,June,2004",2004-06-10,"   ÐŸÑ€Ð¸Ð²ÐµÑ‚!  I'm glad that this day is finally over.  If all of those preps hadn't been in my last period class of the day I would have been fine.  My internet has been going extremely slow so I had to reconnect about four times.  Now I am talking to one of my friends and she is telling me that she heard a ""bad but true story"" (hmm...) about me that shows exactly how much of an ""a-hole"" I really am...that's almost funny...although, she is sworn to secrecy not to tell me the story or who told her.  And she just said that the other main person is the true a-hole in the story and not me, after she thought about it.  Hmm...I want to finish watching The Craft, but I am too tired to watch the whole thing with the commentary without passing out less than five times.  You know, water doesn't really keep your breath fresh.  I wish we had central air in this house...it becomes quite humid at points and the air flow is almost non-existant unless you were to knock down the entire front wall.  I wonder if the gas prices are going to go down and I DON'T think that the power is going to be handed over to the Iraqis by the deadline.  That new Coca Cola (C2) is kinda good.  It has half the carbs and half the sugar...although it contains phenylalanine, which is the fake sugar in diet products that causes cancer in lab rats... Ð´Ð¾ Ð·Ð°Ð²Ñ‚Ñ€Ð°!  "
25704,3602089,"10,June,2004",2004-06-10,"   Hallo alle personen!  Wir sind in die Schweiz!  I we have had a great flight with no delays.  We checked out a swiss clock shoppe and bought lots of neat stuff in the village that that was in.  The wood carvings all over the villiages are amaying...most houses are over 400 years old.  Surprisingly, in the hotel that we are staying at (in the villaige it is in) there is a musik festival going on that we have been to...very interesting but since we cannot drink beer, there is not much to do there but walk aound and look at the sidewalk shops and food stands.  The language barrier doesn't really create a problem...usually only machines.  Today we checked out lots of waterfalls as well, but I must go now...only 40 seconds left...yak  "
25705,3602089,"10,June,2004",2004-06-10,"   From today, there are only four more days until I go to Europe.  While at the mall, I went in to Holiday Hairstyles to get a haircut and saw my one friend from the skating rink getting her hair done.  She is being a bridesmaid for her one friend this afternoon.  Her hair was halfly-braided, halfly-twisted, with small butterfly clips everywhere and small curls in the back.  As soon as I step foot onto Paris concrete, I am going to buy fifty-four crepes...fifty-four because everyone else always picks a stupid number like ""fifty"" or ""fifty-two"".  Why did Coca Cola get rid of their ""Surge"" line of soda?!  I thought it was quite good...I know it's weird for me to be talking about it now since it happened many months ago (before Christmas), but I am just now realizing how much I miss it.  I like most all sodas except for Diet Pepsi (Pepsi One is ok though...).  I love the vanilla colas.  If you like both Vanilla Coke and Pepsi Vanilla, check this...v. coke contains artificial vanilla flavorings while pepsi v. contains pure vanilla extract.  Also, I mentioned in an earlier post that C2 contains phenylalanine that causes cancer in lab rats...Pepsi just introduced Pepsi Edge which has half the sugar and carbs (same thing as C2), but does not replace it with the fake sugar!  Amen to that, Pepsi!  They seem to be thinking more about what's ""healthy in an already bad-for-your-body soda""...which is enough for me.  Even though Pepsi tends to go the natural way, I still buy Coca Cola more now just because the shape of the bottle is more appealing to me than the regular Pepsi bottle...lol...what a tart...  "
25706,3602089,"10,June,2004",2004-06-10,"   Since I got my iPod from Apple about three months ago, I have gotten very poor quality output of bass and terrible sound distortion on my favorite kind of music, Russian Techno (specifically, the artists Ð ÑƒÑÑÐºÐ¸Ð¹ Ð Ð°Ð·Ð¼ÐµÑ€, Ð’Ð¸Ñ€ÑƒÑ, and Ð ÑƒÐºÐ¸ Ð’Ð²ÐµÑ€Ñ…).  I have used a little music format converter for a while and decided to fool around with the bit rate and file type.  I converted some .WMA files into mp3s because Apple won't play windows media audio formats...go figure.  Lol...anyway, I discovered that the songs sound perfect, except there is still not enough bass to satisfy me.  I don't exactly know what I did differently this time to change the format because all of the settings are the same as last time I did this.  Anyway, I have only eleven more days until I fly to Europe for twenty-one days, which is going to be very fulfilling for my travel craving for a few months.  The drivers' saftey classes I have been taking all of this week and will continue to for the length of next weeks is total hell.  The teacher acts like a younger version of Mr. Rogers on delta-9 tetrahydrocanabinol, or even crack cocain...it doesn't matter, he's a little too happy in the mornings but is annoying at the same time, which is nearly impossible for the rest of us.  Now, I must look for my camera tripod before my trip so I don't miss the perfect long exposure shot of the Notre Dame cathedral...this house is such a mess I'll never find it in the piles of shiz flooding my ""space""...  "
10688,3605346,"15,June,2004",2004-06-15,"    Three days ago, i received a text message from my father and it went like this, ""Gud pm, pinatawag kami ng parents ni richie, wag daw ang hindi kame pupunta sorry hindi ka na namin nahintay.""  I missed his three calls and two of my brother's.  I then called them up.  My dearest kuya is getting married.  Mixed emotions.  I wasn't shocked at all coz i saw it coming na.  But when i asked inay on the date, she told me, this coming month. Sad ako, excited, and surprised.    Finally, my kuya's getting married after years of unending search for the right one.  I dunno what to feel.  Affected ba ako? ""Baket kelangan ako maapektuhan eh ndi naman ako yung ikakasal?""  That's what i was thinking.  Excited pa nga ako kase, magkakaron na ko ng pamangkin na gagawin kong spoiled. Together with my nasnip, i was suddenly thinking on what my pamangkin-to-be would be calling me.  Excited na kong magkaron ng pamangkin.  Excited din ako kase magpapasukat na naman ng gown para sa kasal.  Of course, dapat ako ang maid of honor.  But, yesterday on my way home.  Because of the traffic, i had time to think, kung ano ano naisip ko, nang biglang pumasok sa isip ko yung kasal ni kuya ko.  I sent him a text message asking him san kame magpapasukat ng damit.  Naging textmates kame for the rest of my trip.  I couldn't believe that in the middle of our conversation, my tears fell.  Syempre, hiya naman ako sa katabi ko, pinigil ko, though masakit sa throat.  Ayoko pa pala mag-asawa si kuya.  Gusto ko pala nandun pa rin sya sa bahay everytime i would go home on weekends.  Pag maggrocery, pag magpapasama ako sa mall, pag magpapasundo ako sa bus stop every friday.  Yung gigisingin ko sya pag dumadating ako. Pag saturday na ayaw kong bumangon, dadaganan nya ko tapos kukulitin yung kamay ko, which i fondly called ""kulinting"" tapos pag hindi pa rin ako bumangon hihilahin nya yung kumot ko para finally bumangon na ko.  These simple things are only few of the things i would definitely miss about him.  Bigla ko ding na-miss yung lolo ko na mahal na mahal namin.  Na sana, he's still alive to this day para makita nya ikasal ang paborito nyang apo.  I'm sure, he would be so proud of my kuya.  Sayang, wala na sya.  Then, i passed by bf na.  Wala nang traffic.  In 10 minutes, i reached home.  I went straight to the room where cous and nasnip waited for me.  I burst into tears with matching words like these, ""ayoko mag asawa si kuya.  Gusto ko lang naman magkaron ng pamangkin."" And then, cous made a remark, ""Dapat kase sinabi mo na, kuya, pwede naman akong magkaron ng pamangkin ng hindi ka nagpapakasal.""  Then the tears stopped.    Ikakasal na talaga sya.  Wala nang makakapigil.  I just have to accept that we would eventually part ways talaga.  Alangan namang kami kami na lang buong buhay namin.  Today, on my way to the office, I was thinking of what gift i will give them on their wedding day.  I wanna give them something na hindi nya ko makakalimutan.  Accepted ko na, but still, i'm sad and crying.  Sana dumating na yung baby who would call me, tita pretty. "

5589,3607694,"20,June,2004",2004-06-20,"    I'm finally seeing the beginning of some brown algae. See, when you first set up a tank, brown algae will begin to grow, and then the brown algae will turn to green algae. Once the brown has turned to green, the tank has been fully cycled, and the water quality is great. I guess the extra fish in there moved the process forward because there are little patches of brown algae sprinkled all over the tank. Which is great because that means the cycle has finally started!   "
5590,3607694,"19,June,2004",2004-06-19,"    Well, it's been a week since I put the two chromis in there, two weeks since the damsel. So, I took a sample of my water to the pet store today to get it tested. He said that my cycle hasn't even started yet. So strange! But they are small fish in a large tank, and he said it wasn't that strange. There wasn't any ammonia in there at all...So, I'm going to take a sample back in another week, and see what it says then. I also don't really need to do a water change yet. So, I might wait another week until I do that. The fish store guy also told me that for a tank my size, that a 20% water change every two weeks would be enough. And since I don't have any ammonia, I could wait a bit.  And...I got another chromis! I just love those guys. So, now I have three. I was a little worried when I first put him in there because one of the ones already in there (I've named him Bilbo), didn't seem to like him. That was almost 8 hours ago though, and they seem fine now. I suppose it was just that he was a new fish and they had to get used to him being there.  So, now I have yellow-tailed damsel(Spike) and three chromis(Iggie, Bilbo, and Gordo). And don't forget my piece of live rock!   "
5591,3607694,"16,June,2004",2004-06-16,"    The fish are still doing great. They are all getting along. I kind of didn't expect them to just because of the nature of damsels. The chromis sure do like to eat. They've already figured out when I'm about to put some food in there and they hover around the place where I put it in. And then it only takes them like two seconds to snatch it all up. It's a little bit of a problem because it's hard for Spike to get any food. I have to distract them to the other side of the tank to keep them from eating all of the food. I'm going to do my first partial water change sometime this week. I'm kind of nervous because I don't want to mess anything up. They are doing so good! But in order for the cycle to go smoothly and to keep them healthy, I need to do one soon.   "
5592,3607694,"12,June,2004",2004-06-12,"    The fish are doing great! I got up this morning and fed them. They went crazy when I put the food in there. Spike(the damsel) doesn't bother the chromis at all. Actually, he hangs out with them a little bit. Speaking of Spike, he was digging around in the rocks last night. Behind this piece of shell, he was picking rocks up in his mouth, swimming out from behind the shell, and spitting them out. He was making himself a little home! I've decided I'd like to get one more green chromis. I really like them, and I think it would be better if I had a group of them. I might get one next week when I go get my water tested at the fish store.   "
5593,3607694,"11,June,2004",2004-06-11,"    Well, I've been watching my new fish, and it seems like they are going to get along fine. The smaller chromis is following the bigger one around. I've named the smaller one Iggie. :) As for the damsel, I've named him Spike because he has little spike-like things that prick up sometimes. Spike isn't messing with the other two, and hopefully he won't start to. I haven't decided on a name for the bigger chromis yet, but I'll think of one. :)   "
5594,3607694,"11,June,2004",2004-06-11,"    Well, I have just started a saltwater aquarium. It's a 65 gallon tank that came with an oak stand/cabinet. I got a power filter that hangs over the side, a heater, and a hydrometer. I haven't gotten a powerhead yet, but I plan on getting one of those in the next few weeks. I'm also going to get a protein skimmer at some point. I got some crushed coral for the substrate. Cleaning that stuff was no fun. And even after I cleaned it, when I put the water in the tank, it made everything all cloudy. I got a few pieces of rock(not live rock) and some sea shells. I left it running for a week, made sure the specific gravity was right and all that mess.  So, a week ago, I went to purchase my first fish. I had read up and I thought a couple of damsels would be perfect for cycling my tank. WRONG! One was bullying the other one terribly. He was bigger than the other one, and would constantly chase him, and not let him swim around in the tank. So, I took the bigger one back. And, I just came home with two green chromis, and a piece of live rock. The fish store guy said the live rock would help the cycling process. Right now, the fish are getting along great, especially the two chromis. They love each other. I don't know how the yellow-tail damsel is going to get along with them, but it seems like it will be okay.   "
5595,3607694,"25,July,2004",2004-07-25,"    I'm starting to get really impatient. I really want to get something new to put in my aquarium(besides live rock). I talked to the guy at the fish store, and he said that I really shouldn't put anything in there until the cycle in completely finished...and that's probably going to be a little while since my tank is so big. I really want some crabs, snails, and shrimp. I don't know why, but I just think it would be awesome to have all sorts of little creatures like that living in there. But, unless the cycle is done, they would probably die. They are really sensitive to water quality. And of course, no new fish until it's done unless I wanted to take one of mine in to trade it for another. But never! I love those fish I have too much to do that. :) Oh well, hopefully the cycle will be over soon.   "
5596,3607694,"21,July,2004",2004-07-21,"    It's almost been a month since I last wrote. Oh well. Things are going well with the tank, although it still hasn't cycled completely yet. I've taken a sample to the fish store every week. It's in the second stage of the cycle. I'm starting to see a few specks of green and red algae as well. I'm really hoping that the cycle will be over soon. I can't wait to get my next fish, plus some intvertebrates...some snails and crabs...and a shrimp. Of course, I've done a fish tank cleaning twice now. I wiped down everything with excess salt on it, cleaned the glass of algae, and changed the water. It was kind of tedious, trying to get the water the same temperature as the water in the tank, plus getting it the right specific gravity.  The fish are doing great though. I can't wait to get another one.   "
5597,3607694,"02,August,2004",2004-08-02,"    Well, the tank in finally cycled! I'm so excited. So, Saturday, I went to the fish store and got a few new things for my tank. I got some live rock, of course, because I still need a ton of that. I also got a Camel Shrimp, named Mr. Whiskers. :) He's cool, but he doesn't wander around much. He likes to hide behind things.

31242,3616679,"12,June,2004",2004-06-12,"   At this time in my life, I desperately need words to live by.  A few years ago, I collected, authored, and wrote a small journal for each of my young sons to be given to them on the day they leave the nest. Remembering this, I took one out and read what I had wrote to them and realized that some of the wisdom I wrote on those pages was abundantly appropriate for me to take to heart one more time. Now to practice what I preach:    Life is not measured by the number of breaths we take... but by the moments that take our breath away.     If you see an opportunity, and you don't know what to do... ask yourself:  ""Will it make me a better person, a better Child of God?"" If the answer is a definite ""YES!""  - then GO FOR IT!!    It takes a strong man to say ""I'm sorry"", and it's easier than digging out of the hole denial creates  somewhere down the road.    I asked the Lord how much He loved me. He answered, ""This much."" And then he stretched out His arms and died for me.    What is Love?  by young children: It's what makes you smile when you're tired. It's what's in the room with you at Christmas if you stop opening presents and listen. It's like when grandma got arthritis and couldln't bend over and paint her toenails anymore - and my grandpa did it for her all the time even when his hands got arthritis too...that's love.    A strong man never stands alone....visible or invisible, there are others holding him up and out towards the world.    The most destructive force in the world?    Gossip.    Never be afraid to try something new...remember: a lone amateur built the Ark, a large group of professionals built the Titanic.    Always leave loved ones with loving words... it may the last time you see them.    Learn that no matter what happens, or how bad it seems today, life does go on, and it will be better tomorrow.  There are more for another time.  Everyone has a favourite group of words stored in the subconscious for times of darkness and despair...don't they? Whether from the Bible, the Torah, the Koran, from their mother, or best friend.  Words that strike a choral note in the heart, sear meaning in the mind, and are tucked away for the rainy days of life.  "
31243,3616679,"12,June,2004",2004-06-12,"   I would never have guessed that 2004 would be a life-transitional time. After living for nearly half of a century, I feel as though I have been shoved back into a cocoon. I must stay hidden, quiet, and dormant for a period of time. Faith in the essence of just being alive fortifies my consciousness to be certain that I will emerge with a new life, a fresh perspective, and the chance to dream again.   I have great hope for the future...I must, or I will not survive the ""re-birth"". For this, I lean on my faith in God. And then will come the business of my God guiding me in ""getting started"" in a new phase of my life...learning to spread my wings and exploring my new world.  But for now, I am curled in my home awaiting my time. Scared, lonely, persecuted, angry...but thanking God for the few good friends who are with me. Patiently I wait for the getting-started-gun to go off to break the chains that bind me.  "
31244,3616679,"01,July,2004",2004-07-01,"   Some days I feel as though if I have to continue to be STRONG  for just one more minute....I will SCREAM!!!  I'm sick of being the strong one. I'm sick of being the one with all the answers. I'm sick of standing up straight with a stiff upper lip. When do I get to lean? When do I get to let another take charge of life, even if just for a little while? When can I lighten up?  My parents leaned on me, my friends lean on me, my spouse leaned on me, my kids lean on me, my co-workers lean on me, my bosses lean on me. Is it just my sympathetic character, or am I inadvertently doing something to attract this attention? I can't lighten up...even while I strive to help others to do so.  Yet, I love helping people.  They are unburdened, and I receive great satisfaction in giving aid. Is it selfish to find satisfaction in that? It would be wrong if I felt relief that they move on and away from me, but what I feel is a great personal sigh of satisfaction: because deep down inside I know that this is what ""life is all about"".  But I can't lighten up. I worry about others, I think about others, I work for others, I care for others, I love others. In taking on their burdens, I add to my own. Yet I do it time and time again knowingly.  And I have so many of my own burdens/problems/crises to deal with right now... I have learned lately who my real friends are. I have watched them step up to the plate as I have weakened. I have felt their hands holding me up. I have listened to their yearnings for my future happiness.  ...and they are not the ones whom I have helped, these special angels are different ones. Appearing out of nowhere,  some of whom I never knew even noticed me before.  Why don't the ones whom I have helped help me now? I sympathize with them again... it must be hard to watch the one who was once your saviour, guardian, protector...fall to pieces before your very eyes. What do they say to me?  What can they do for me?  What is most imporant is that I practice what I preach. That I do in front of these ones that which I urged them to do. And most importantly, that I show them that it works time and time again...because they are watching me.  "

And my gift to Dave was to get(hire) a DJ...so he doesn't have to ""do"" the music at his own party! I thought long and hard and asked for many recommendations from friends and colleges on who I should see/hire.  Then....one Friday afternoon...it hit me like a ton of bricks....My favorite DJ on FMU was playing some really wicked shit!  Could I ask him? I did.... and he does...do parties that is....and he likes good food....Beth and I cooked for him while He & Dave looked over our ""stuff/vinyl"". We had a mixed greens salad with gold and red beets, avocado, heirloom tomatoes, cucumbers, red and orange peppers, jicima, and chilpolte/ maple glazed Shrimp.

They are listed in ""Orange, N.J."".  I find out later that people who know him refer to him as ""that crumb"".

13980,3626700,"21,June,2004",2004-06-21,"   Ever since about a few hours ago i didnt understand why my father was the way he was, and why he was my father. What did i do to deserve him as my father? Was it just bad karma? Or does things really happen for a reason? Well in my case things really do happen for a reason. There are always lessons behind actions, and lessons that i have to learn at this time in my life, and God never fails with that. He shows me why everything the was it is, and to look beyond whats right in front of me, just by certain actions that take place in ordinary life. This lesson that i learned yesterday took place at church. And lets just say it really hit home.   The subject of the sermon yesterday was Seeing God as a Perfect Father, ""perfection vs. reflection"". Tom, our lead minister,(who is awesome by the way ;) ) gave this very heart-felt sermon which left me in tears from the beginning all the way to the end. Tom talked about how we all want and need our earthly father's blessing. We yearn for that. And in my case, i knew from that moment that i would be a wreck. We want our fathers love, blessing, active participation, and encoragement. We also want he's spoken belied in who we are and what will will become. Our Perfect Father is the Lord God himself. He is our real father. He makes up for everything our earthly father doesnt have. This is the reason why we have fathers. For the very reason. we need the love , we need the support, and we need their blessing. Its our very instinct that we rely on that blessing to get us through life, to build our self-esteem, to make us know that someone loves us and supports us through life. And when you don't get that blessing, life gets tough. And thats what happened to me.   A.W. Tozer states thats ""the most important thing about a person is waht that person thinks about when they think about God."" This is one of my standards that i live by. I try and put this into everyday life. Applying it to the people i meet and how i can change their view on the father himself. Show them what an awesome God He really is, and show them what he has done in my life alone, and show them what He can do in there life. Show them that the Lord is our Perfect Father, and that his love for us is endless beyond eternity.  ""How great is the love the Father has lavished on us, that we should be called the children of God! And that is what we are! the reason the world does not know us is that it did not know him. Dear friends, now we are children of God, and what we will be has not yet been made known. But we know that when he appears, we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is.""- 1 John 3:1-2  There are five types of Earthly fathers models. These models are similar but they have there own distinctive qualities. They are: The empowering father, the abusive father, the absent father, the possessive father, and the performances based father. They are basically self explanitory. My father was a mixture of all really. HE was more a abusive and performanced based father though. The performanced based father is when you have to live up to his standards in order to get his love and his blessing, and if you dont succeed at this, then you get the grunt, the cursing and the abuse. (This is so hard for me to write but i feel like i should be, so therefore i am.) You see my father was always like you show me you can do this, and ill give you my blessing. BUt if you screw up along the way your in for a nasty treat. And basically to him, my whole existence is a screw up. But Tom talked about that too. And he showed us that in the bible it actually says you are not accident, that the Lord planned our existence. Basically the core truth in Tom's words is that God is not the reflection of your earthly dad; he is the perfection of your earthly dad. God will always give me the love, the blessing, the forgiveness that im lacking from my earthly father. He will never frown upon nor be distant and angry with me. He knows you even before you were concieved. He made you. To me, this is what i had to hear. I had to know why. why was my father the way he was, why was i his supposive daughter, why did it always feel like it was my fault. Well i know now that all i need from my earthly father is everything i can get from my Perfect Father. I will still keep up everything im doing with my father(e.g calling him, trying to get him to listen to me if i can actually get a hold of him, that type thing..and eventually try and get him to God...it will be a challenge, but im up for it.)  ""Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened for you. For everyone who ask recieves; he who seeks finds; and to him that knocks, the door will be opened. Which of you, if his son ask for bread, will give him a stone? Or if he ask for a fish, will give him a snake? If you, then, though you were evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give good gifts to those who ask him!""- Matthew  7:7-11  This whole sermon was soo overwhelming but i really, really needed it. I needed to know that the Lord was there for me,(i really dont know how to phrase that, but to me its sounds odd) and that it wasnt my fault for the way my fahter was. I needed to know that i was a punching bag for a reason, that there was all a reason for his madness. I needed that closure that i wasnt a screw up, and that i really am cared for. The qualities of a perfect father are; Everything a Perfect father says is   true. everything the perfect father does, is   right. Everything the perfect father hears, he   understands. Everything the perfect father promises, he   delivers on. The perfect father    isnt going anywhere. He will always always be there for you, no matter what. And not all dads are bad. Many of them fit the father profile. But there are many that don't. And there are reasons for that. Just remember the perfect father is always there, with open arms.   ""even if my father and mother forsake me, the Lord will   recieve me."" psalms 27:10. This passage was the one that hit home with me. It was the closure i needed to get through life. I will always always have that one in my heart. that is the verse that should be publicized around the world for all to hear, Because once i heard it, i knew that all would be alright, for a while. Tom's message really got me throughout the whole thing. He ended it with "" The miracle today is that you can leave this place having a BETTER blessing- a blessing from a Perfect father.""  Tom had found a ""fathers love letter"" online and used it in his sermon. It was a letter from God himself, straight from the bible. Its a ""cry of a Father's heart from Genesis to Revelation"". If you want to check it out go to www.FathersLoveLetter.com   There was really a hidden message in it too. Well for some, they didnt see it. But i saw it. I saw it because i think it was only there for me to see. I saw it because it was actually happening at the same time. And it stood out because of that. God purposely did it for me to recognize it. He wanted me to see that there was someone who physically cared for me and that loved me and wanted to be there beside me through my rough times. And I just want to thank her for staying with me, because believe it or not, shes helped  me keep my cool. Just that feeling of someone sitting next to you and caring for you, its calming. It showed me how much that one person cared, and i needeed it at that time. I know my mom or someone would have hugged me or something, but then i also now there would have been a smart comment that would have ruined the moment. And i just needed one of those long, long hugs that last for life, long after you let go. One of those reassuring its alright hugs/i know that was painful type hugs. I want to let that perosn know that i appreciate her for being there with me through my rough times and to let her know that she is cared for on the opposite end of the chain that bonds us together, and that if she ever needs to talk or just someone to listen that im there for that. She is truely loved for life, and not just by me, by many.   I hope this message gets out to all, and that those people who have that rotten relationship with there father, or jsut really need to hear that there is someone else out there that cares for you. God will always always be there for you, through all times. ever.    Loved by my father,   sam.   "
13981,3626700,"18,June,2004",2004-06-18,"   I run my fastest But still get beat i land on my head when i should land on my feet i try to move forward but im stuck in reverse  Why do i keep at it? i won't be left behind  The harder im thrown, the higher i bounce. I give it my all, and thats all that counts.  In first place, myself, i seldom find. So I push it to the limits- I wont be left behind  Some people say you can't. Some say don't. Some simply give up. i reply, I won't.  The power is here, locked away in my mind, My perseverance is my excellence. I won't be left behind.  Make the best of each moment. The future is soon the past. the more i tell myself this,  The less i come in last.  Throughout my competitions i learned what winning is all about,  a plain, clear lesson: Giving up is the easiest way out.  So every night before i go to bed i hope in a small way i have shined tomorrow is a brand new day and i wont be left behind.    I wrote this poem while i was living at my dad's house. It got me through a lot. And sometimes to this day, it still gets me through...piece by piece. but for the little things now. I automatically remember it when im being challenged. From just test to other things that i have to go through in life. But now i have the Lord for my stength to get through. That, and i finally have love, that love that gets you through a lot. The Lord has donnne sooooo much in my life, i am soo grateful to just be alive. He has saved me and made me conquer all my quest. HE can do the same for you to...all you have to do is have faith.    ""He gives power to the weak, and to those who have no might He increases strength. Even the youth shall faint and be weary. And the young men shall utterly fall, But those who wait on the Lord shall renew their strngth; They shall mount up with wings like eagles, they shall run and not be weary, they shall walk and not faint.""

13982,3626700,"16,June,2004",2004-06-16,"   I dont really understand what makes my dad the way he is. I think it is that he is lacking a relationship with Christ.(He claims to be catholic, but going to church is a hassle for them and they already claim there going to hell anyways. i dont really understand why he is like that. he supports me in my ""church business"" as he would call it. He doesnt like how i do it every weekend though, how i love it too. HE thinks church is torture.) I can understand that somehow i've hurt him by moving out of his home but i could not take the unholiness and the uptight ""dont laugh your not funny atmostphere, your to hyper for our dry personalities."" But what i dont understand is that when i call him, he doesnt feel the need to answer. I mean we started talking again after almost a year in february but before then he Refused to talk to me. I felt horrible. when he finally called me on that special valentines day this year, we agreed that our relationship would get back to normal. We even saw each other on that same day. It was a bit uncomfortable but I managed. I felt like the whole time i was being judged on everything, but i just remembered thats how it was at my dads house. So i started out calling him every other day. And that went well in the beginning, little did i know that he was trying to change the person that i have become. Trying to pull the carpet out from underneath my finally stagnant feet. My foundation was nearly constructed, with tidbits here and there willing to be glued for perfection. So, willing to fill in those holes, i started to listen to him, and change back to the person that i was, little by little. Finally when i realized what he was doing to me, i was in awe of what had happened. I had trusted him. He could not see my happiness through the what he was doing.But the remark from him that made me notice what he was doing was this very phrase: You cant hide behind religion. That killed me. I knew from then on he was trying to murder me and use my body for ""the perfect child"" in his mind. trying to tell me i wasnt good enough, too fat, and that i lowered my standards, whatever that means. he didnt notice that i finally loved the person who i had become.they couldnt see the change in personality that i have now. I have the Lord. He makes up the light of the world. My Father doesnt understand that everyone needs to have a relationship with Christ. So one day after he got through ""the list of everything i need to do in order to become the person who i was in a past life"", i just told him; that i didnt like how he was trying to run my life because for once i was on the right road and that i finally found my home in life. I didnt want to change my hair color or lose weight, or kill my personality. I also told him that i wasnt hiding behind my religion, and that it wasnt a religion, it was a relationship with christ. I told him i forgive him for everything he had done to me in the past and that he was only trying to figure out what was wrong with me. and then i told him why i was acting out: I wanted out. I could stand the restraint. I needed God.( i didnt notice it then but i really did need the lord. and i believe he caused me to act the way i was. and i believe he didnt want me there anymore.) He works in extrodinary ways. I knew it then but it didnt really click. The whole time i was being tortured at my fathers house, i was always praying to the Lord to help me and let me find the way out of trouble. Just the little things. Ive never done anything drastic before, so no need to worry about much. just like talking back and disobeying...i never hurt anyone by it...i just needed out.. i was yearning to be loved, and just to be hugged. I was basically in solitary confinment.couldnt talked to anyone in the house without having consequences and the only time they talked to me was when i was ""in trouble"". no hi or bye, no i love you, no hugs, no love. That when i started to believe that the world for me was over and that no one will ever love me again. ( I think that is half the reason why i am the person who i am now.) My Dad and stepmom took me to my ""normal"" counsling appts to try to figure out what was ""wrong with me"". The counselor saw nothign wrong with me. So they decided to talk to my parents(Dad and stepmom, and occasionally my mom) and they'd basically put words in everyones mouth, meaning not being able to fend for myself because they believed my parents over me. (We've had some good times before all this though, so you know my life before wasnt strictly hell. ) And dont get me wrong i love all these people to death, i just dont see why they wouldnt let me be, just listen to me once in my life. LET ME OUT was all i wanted to say. i couldnt understand why they were refraining me back from this world that i wanted to live in. So anyways, back to the story. They told the counselors that they thought i had a variety of disorders such as OCD(obsessive Compulsive Disorder), Bipolar, ADHD, PDS (Post Dramatic Stress),and on top of that ODD(something difiant disorder), when really....all it came out to be was jsut my personality. I believed them for a little bit until i moved in with my mother and noticed that none of that stuff was really true. I just needed out. So that part of my life was  very restrained. That was a bit of background in my life. But really what im trying to get at now is that he wont answer my phone calls. Everytime i call, the answering machine picks up. And im no good with messages. So one day he answered the phone after a few weeks and told me i was going down hill and all that jazz..(when my grades werent good) and that when i leave a message to not say ""hey its me"" because he has a name. But im not directing the message to just him its basically to everyone. So yeah, im just going to leave it up to God to work on my father and our relationship. Just have to have faith and not rush myself because these things take time right? right. HEy ive notice that this thing is a good counselor. :) maybe i should tell them that i found one....theyd probably put me in for sessions again. ANNNNNYYYWHHHOOO... So im just going to live life the way i have been. Maybe he thinks that not talking to me will bring me down....hmmm... never thought of it that way. I have no clue what really brought this on to write about this but somehow it all just poured out. Dont really know what to do..there isnt much. I just keep calling and praying.   Well...   "" Then Peter came to Him and said,""Lord how often shall my brother sin against me, and i forgive him, up to seven times?""

13983,3626700,"14,June,2004",2004-06-14,"   Today i had finals. I have been praying and praying all week for them to be easy enough for me to pass and for me to have the wisdom to understand what im doing and to be able to let this week pass by comfortly without stress. I totally put everything in God's hands, leaving it up to him to carry me through all of the exams. Well ive gotten through two today, actually 1 4/5 but i can finish that up tomorrow because of my charming witts--and of course her not knowing how long she made the test. but all in all, i feel pretty good about them. there are 2 advantages to Giving everything to Christ to handle and having faith that he will pursue. One- It is A LOT less stressful then holding the world up on your own 2 shoulders. and two- It pleases the Lord.  ""But without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek him""- Hebrews 11:6  The bible talks a lot about having faith and about people who had faith. In the world, you don't often see much faith. In fact, some people are negative almost all the time. Any time you presented them with a big idea, they will start rattling off reasons why it wont work automatically. That's not faith.  In order to please God, you've got to have faith. You've got to be sure of ""the substance of things hoped for"" and to believe in what you can't see. God does give people dreams and ideas; and most of the time they seem bigger than your abilities and resources. He wants you to be absolutely positive that he can make it happen.  Start by believing in the bible. Faith can really grow as you begin to get confident in  His Word. Dont just memorize some verses. Get them into your heart. Try them and let God show you he means business. He's good for His Word. Believing Him is crucial, and no one else can do it for you. You have to develop your own faith and determine not to be shaken. You'll see it work and Gow will be pleased.  ""Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. For by it the elders obtained a Good testimony. By faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that the things that were seen were not made of things which are visible.""- Hebrew 11:1-4  ""behold the proud, His soul is not upright in him; But the just shall live by his faith."" - Habakkuk 2:4  ""Have faith in God.""-Mark 11:22  ""Your faith has saved you. go in peace."" Luke 7:50  "" watch, stand fast in faith, be brave, be strong.Let all that you do be done with love."" - 1 corinthians 16: 13-14  ""For we walk by faith and not by sight."" - 2 corinthians 5:7  ""We are bound to thank God always for you, brethren, as it is fitting, because your faith grows exceedingly, and the love of everyone of you all bounds towards each other, so that we ourselves boast of you among the churches of God for your patience and faith in your persecutions and tribulations that you endure.""- 2 thessalonians 1:3-4  ""Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, to which you were called and have confessed the good confession in the presence of many witnesses.""- 1 timothy 6:12   Carried by christ,  Samantha.

20419,3631998,"04,August,2004",2004-08-04,"   Well I got me a  urlLink gmail  today thanks to  urlLink JosÃ© Rojas . How did I get it? Go to  urlLink Gmail Swap  and find out. But I'm here to talk about all the free stuff on the web.  What really is free in the world? I know of two things 1)  urlLink Sindome  and 2)  urlLink Starwars MUSH . They are the only two things that are really free on the internet that I know of.  Why? It's simple, every free service on the internet isn't free. There is a cost to maintain a server and when there are costs there is money. Let's take e-mails for instance, there are web servers, data servers and personal to pay for. But you aren't paying for them, as neither am I. Or are we? Yes we are. Every time we access our free online e-mail we generate renevue for the ones that give us free stuff.  Renevue is directly connected to the number of times a web page is shown, but in this case it is advertising. If you thought banners, you're right. Every time you go to  any  website that has a service that is free there is at least one banner on it. And I must say that I love banners, simply for the fact that they just take a small portion of the page and do nothing until you click them. But I hate popups, popups are the devil spawn and should be forbidden of existence. They are simply the most annoying thing on the whole internet (apart from 13 years old boys who think they know everything).  But back to the topic, there is no such thing as free stuff on the internet. Someone is paying for it.  Internet = cost . And whenever you see a banner you know that the page you're seeing right there was paid for the guy who ordered that banner. And by having that banner on the page, you increased that advertisement exposure by 1.  Multiply that one by the various pages an average user goes thru on a day and by the number of users that service has and you'll know that I'm talking about a lot of money. That pays your free service and even generates income for the company, lots of income... Trust me if there isn't profit they wouldn't do it.  Now back to free e-mails, Google's Gmail will offer 1Gb (one gigabyte!!!) of space for your e-mails and that's a lot! Yahoo has raised it's quota to 100Mb in response. So what's the deal? Is Google using all it's money from selling shares on the market to buy storage space?  Not really. The space you have in any e-mail account is virtual. That means that they don't reserve 1Gb or 100Mb for each account. They raise the account space as it is needed. Something like if you have 2mb of space used you'll have like 4mb freed for your account once it gets close to that they'll get you another 2mb and so on... That's how they can offer thousands of people 100Mb of free space. Most of the users stay on the 50% usage of a 4mb account just so they can receive larger e-mails when needed. But with 1Gb people will start to go nuts and pass on larger and larger e-mails. How Google will cope with that I do not know, but I'll be testing a big fat email soon. Maybe I'll send myself a DVD rip of some movie I have or something... 600mb on one e-mail. [Edit] It appears that the maximum size of any email you can send or receive from Gmail is 10Mb Still good enough [/Edit]  The catch of Gmail is directed advertising, they want you to keep your e-mails so they have a good base on what interests you have and other stuff. The procedure is totally automated and scans for keywords on your mails. It's neat stuff, revolutionary and will be a success. Imagine having banners that are pertinent to what you like without having some type of worm or cookie installed on your computer? The rate of clicks by ads shown will raise sky high.  Way to go Google. "
20420,3631998,"04,August,2004",2004-08-04,"   I like black. I have black as the background of my computer screen, on the background of my NetBeans and text editors. I love it. But I am not fond of pastel greens over black, don't ask me why. Maybe it's just too much Cyberpunk influence, but for me green on black has to look like it will burn your eye. Full glowing green with the faint ones being at 70% when on the minimum.  And I like blue, and blue on black too so I took some time from my working day to make this thing blue on black. Gave it some fades and tried to make the colors on the sidebar not get more attention than the post itself. So there you have it, new colors and duotoneish style.  Oh yeah, if you can't read the darker stuff, your computer screen isn't set up correctly. It's not my fault. I can read them all. Fix your brightness and contrast, I won't change it back. "
20421,3631998,"04,August,2004",2004-08-04,"   Sometimes when I'm playing RPGs (either online or not), I get the feeling that everyone is an elf. Really, most of people describe their characters as beautiful people, thin, tall and even  tanned ! And when I say most people, I'm talking about a big fat portion of them, if the ones that don't have greek gods as their characters would be put on a pie graph, their slice would be slim.   I mean, come on! Why does everyone  need  to be gorgeous, sexy and fit? I'm known to have some of the weirdest characters all around and I play mostly for the fun, than for giving my ego a boost up. People, please get real and break that barrier where your character is a representation of yourself like you would like them to be. Some of the players of both online text based RPGs that I play (Sindome and SWMUSH) are already there and it's a bliss, but even in those places much of the options on character creation are left behind and overlooked.   Why? People like to look good, they feel pretty... It's the subliminal connection between yourself and your character. You want to be accepted, you want to be among the 'cool people'. Well guess what? You don't! It's a game, make your character so you get the most of it, and in the RP focus make him different. Always remember different doesn't mean better, never. On a world of elves the dwarf stands out. If everyone is gorgeous, tall and fit as a bull. Create something different, give them scars (and not those cool ritualistic ones), make a Sloth from goonies and see how much fun you'll have everyday instead of the same thing day after day.   But as far as looks goes, it isn't the biggest of problems. One of the biggest I found everywhere is what I call over-especialization. It's like you have one character and all that he can do is this and nothing more. He's the best on this but if he's ever alone and he needs to do that, he's doomed. It's like having a car jacker that only drives automatic cars, once he gets his hands on an expensive as hell ferrari he's done. He'll never take the car out... RPGs are all about diverse situations where you'll need to use lots of skills in order to get away in one piece.   On Neverwinter Nights there are loads of people that create a character that is the best at fighting and can kill a dragon alone... Guess what? One trap on the floor and he's history. Why? No variation, the same thing over and over again. See monster, knockdown, devastating critical, rinse and repeat. Even mages on nwn are repetitive as hell, the guy doesn't even change his spells to see what he can do. No it's bigby's, bigby's, bigby's, bigby's, missile storm, missile storm, rinse and repeat on the next target.   And people say that the game is getting dull. Why? Because of you ( and sometimes me too, I admit ). Try to broaden your RP by thinking outside the usual box and aiming for something that makes you unique. Once you got that, no day will be dull. "
20422,3631998,"04,August,2004",2004-08-04,"   I don't know if you noticed, but now I have a footer on every page that looks like this :         Unless otherwise expressly stated, all original material of whatever nature created by  urlLink Diego M. Diehl  and included in this weblog and any related pages, including the weblog's archives, is licensed under a  Creative Commons License .      Now what the hell is that? That is another bright idea that started on the internet and thru it became versuccessfulll. What that is? It is a copyright that allows the use of the work or part of it.  Let me explain this on a simple way. Everytime you create something, that automatically has a copyright on it. You made it, you spent your time in the creation, it's yours. No-one can copy, use part of it, distribute or any other thing without your consent. That is the 'Ã‚Â©' next to logos and on every book you'll find on a bookstore.  But since the popularization of the internet one thing came up quickly : cooperative work. We suddenly have lots of people from around the world working on the same program/book/music. And there was the single person that made something that he wanted to be distributed thru the internet. Be it a free software or a book. With that raised the GNU license that has it's pro's and cons and normally only applies to software.   urlLink Creative Commons  created a few ""copyright licenses"" for normal people. That means no lawyers, nor confusions when trying to use someone's work. Each license has two versions, the easy-to-read-and-easy-to-understand one and the legal wording one. Both say the same thing one is for the average people (you and me) and the other is for the lawyers of the world that like to speak weird stuff and read 3000 lines affirming something that can be said in one line and without fuss.  So Creative Commons made the (CC), something that states: ""I made this, but you can use it if you do this and that."" Simple, easy and fair to all. And better yet CC covers from text to music and other stuff.  Clearly everyone that has something online should check  urlLink Creative Commons  so they can assure their rights and still allow people to use their work. Like I do.  My type of CC License, says simply that you can use anything on this blog and by use I mean : copy, distributexhibitbit, execute, create something using this as a starting point, and even use commerciallylly. But you have to give me credit for what is my work and everything you do has to have the same License. It's that simple.  Use freely but add my name to the damn thing so I get the credit I deserve.  Cool?  I know I am. "
20423,3631998,"04,August,2004",2004-08-04,"   Today I updated my  urlLink Yahoo Messenger  and it came with a thing called  urlLink LAUNCHcast Radio  sure it is Yahoo pushing another of their services to their customers and shit. But since you can create your station for free and themusic quality is good, I gave it a try. And I must say this : COOL!!! &nbsp; Their casting is smooth and works well. I already have something like 2-3 Gb of MP3s at my work computer just to keep the variety going, but withbroadband internet acess and the radio I'm pretty sure my horizon of musichas just exploded. Another thing on  urlLink LAUNCHcast  is that you can rate almost everything, from genre to artist, albums and song. With that in place they'll keep playing the stuff you like and avoid what you don't like. If they're going to sell that information, or use it to clean their buttocks I don't really care. I want a soundtrack to work with and I don't care about anadvertising here and there.So if you want to check my station  urlLink click here "
21847,3639495,"29,June,2004",2004-06-29,"   Let's all pause for a second to give it up for the unsung heroes of the human race:   TRAFFIC COPS!  No, I'm not talking about the beat cops who apparate in your rearview mirror out of thin air, Dumbledore style.  I'm sure there's a time and a place for forcing people to obey basic speed law, but they never DO seem to be at the right time or place, do they?  Sure, when you're trying to slink off to school at 7:50, there's no shortage of black and whites, but when your car nearly gets tidily-winked off the freeway by a bass-thumping, low-riding, erector-set-detailed rice rocket.   Wow.  How old was that sentence?  Nevertheless, it is therapeutic to wave your fist in the air and yell ""young whippersnappers!"" in digi-rant form.   No, I mean the ""standing in the middle of the intersection with the white cotton gloves and scary polyester pants"" traffic cops.  An integral cog in the machinery of modern society that I've always taken for granted...  Until last Saturday.  Dateline: Devore, California.  A little patch of Appalachia nestled amid the junction of the 15 and 215 freeways.  Nothing but dirt and monster trucks for miles around.  And then, rising like an oasis of pure rock & roll in the wilderness, it stands: the 40,000+ seat Hyundai Pavilion at Glen Helen.  My sister and I headed out to Glen Helen this weekend to see the No Doubt/Blink-182 concert--a double bill about which Jennifer wryly observed ""we would have killed to see that show... seven  years ago!""  It DID have a major 1997 vibe up in here.  Nonetheless, it was a rockin' show, and we had a great time.  It turns out music was pretty strong in the last millennium.    So: encore, No Doubt is coming out for their final bows, and Jen and I decide to hightail it out of there to get back to the car as quickly as possible.  Unfortunately, about a thousand other people had the same idea, but that's okay: that's still a head start over the other 39, right?  We're hauling as fast as possible back to a parking lot that is somehow exponentially farther from the venue than it was when we left it earlier that evening, trying to save precious seconds by cutting in front of slow-moving couples, bobbing and weaving through people-traffic like the aforementioned rice rockets that irritate me so, but the possibility of making it onto the freeway two seconds earlier than the rest o' the dirt people somehow excuses our inconsiderate crowd wading behavior.  Finally, success!  Back at the car, squeezing into the tiny gap formed when we open the doors without scratching our neighbors' rides, throwing it into reverse without backing into the drunken hordes streaming out of the concert, and then: hurrah!  We're facing out, we're heading up the aisle, we're on our way, one of the first out, nothing can stop us now!    And then: a car about five spots up pulls out into our lane, and the two of us are trying to get out.  No problem.  Then, a convertible beamer with a truly heinous lady inside pulls in front of us.  But that's cool, we're still rolling...at a snail's pace.  Then another car pulls out.  And another.  And so on, and so forth.  And they tell two friends, and they tell two friends.  And all of a sudden, EVERY car has been pulled out of its spot, but there's nowhere for ANYONE to drive, because we're just a huge line of cars, pulled out of their spots, with nowhere to go.  Our brilliant plan of beating everyone else by sliding out juuuust at the end of the encore turned out to be  everyone else's plan , too!   But that's no problem.  Jennifer and I are good times, we can entertain ourselves, we own some kickin' tunes, we're in no particular hurry...this line will start moving soon enough, right?  Half an hour later, after having moved maybe THREE car lengths total, we turned off the engine to preserve precious battery juices, which means: the small comfort of occupying ourselves with kickin' tunes must go down the drain.  Lots of other cars started getting the same idea, so now, we're a whole line of parked cars that only occasionally grind on the engine to roll forward a precious few inches forward, so as not to let any stragglers back their cars into the tiny pocket created by unaware drivers.  Still, we're still good company, right?  Jen and I have the best of times...when we're in a happy mood, which is 99.44% of the time, a la the purity level of Ivory soap.  (David Letterman once said the other .56% of Ivory soap is filled with pure jam preserves...crack open a bar and check it out for yourself!)   You know what gets us into the other .56% of the time faster than anything else?  People.  Lots of people.  Large herds of agitated, obnoxious, drunken, mildly frightening, brain dead 909ers who haven't the foggiest notion how to MERGE properly so as to get out of the parking lot safely.    Merging.  Huge, tough concept that Los Angeles natives take for granted.  Every other car and you'll get there soon enough, we PROMISE.    But guess what?  If NO ONE agrees to let anyone go in front of them, there ends up being an eight-car can-can line at a standoff in front of the two-lane driveway, with no one able to squeeze their cars out of the spot because no one's willing to give an inch and let anyone squirm ahead of them.    And each of those eight cars in the can-can line have an ENORMOUS line of cars behind them, equally unmoving, except to close tiny gaps between cars into even tinier, nonexistent, wafer-thin slices of air between bumpers, so as to ensure NO ONE take their spots, either!  And the longer Jen and I dwell in that .56% of our personalities, the more we start becoming agitated and unsafe 909ers ourselves, such that we soon developed a rule for ourselves that, as long as we could see the printing on the top of the next car's license plate frame, we weren't too close.  Bad.  Bad, bad, bad.  As we are parked in this car...not even feigning hope that one day, movement may happen, Jennifer unbuckles to slither up out the car window and survey the landscape.  Nothing but parked cars for miles around.  No one is moving.  Lots of angry red brakelights, and even angrier fists slamming against steering wheels that really never did anything to deserve such violence.  She also sees: a few people who have given up entirely, and have pulled back into a parking spot to take a nap and wait out the traffic; the occasional pod of tailgaters numbing the pain of our hellish standstill with countless empty 40s littering the back of their truckbeds...yeah, I really want to share the road with those guys in a few...years, or whenever we'll get out of this lot; and oh-so-worst-of-all, a few hair-tossing, giggly, slithery-looking girls who have decided to pass the time by making their dates grateful that they don't need to pay attention to the road because SO many more interesting things can happen in a  parked  car!  Ick.    Yuck.    Ew.    Noooo!    Remember that convertible in front of us with the truly heinous lady inside?  Yeah, well, so will everyone else who walked up our aisle on the way to their cars that night.  Which, we must confess, did make a decent diversion for a few minutes as we watched other people comment outright, exchange horrified glances at their friends, flash their highbeams or honk angrily at the silly trashy woman.  Oh, and to her man's credit, he didn't seem too into her either, because seriously: silly trashy woman!  Convertible!  No!  Long story short, (YES, this IS short, compared to the actual agony of being there!) can you imagine our abject horror when,  two hours  later, we've made it to the can-can bottleneck of cars at the driveway, and we realize that the problem was that Glen Helen Pavilion hires NO parking lot attendants, no traffic cops, no one with the foresight to think, hmmm...if we told which cars to go and which to stop, we'd ALL get to go home a little sooner...  Anarchy in the parking lot = total automotive stagnation.  Drivers left to their own devices = unparalleled stupidity.  Dirt people suddenly evolving into polite sensible individuals who give others the right of way = as likely as when pigs fly at the speed of sound and finally master the art of outrunning Farmer John before he can saute them into full-fat bacon.  Mmmmm, bacon.  Never mind that, once we've made it out onto the street, it's still a sub-1-MPH crawl the final stretch to the freeway, where we somehow managed to anger the truck a few lanes over into a double-fisted flick off, followed by proctologically-close tailgating, high-beam flashing, and attempted faux-ramming worthy of that silly 70s B-movie,  Death Race 2000 .           Do you see how driving REALLY ought to happen faster than a mere 500 yards in 2 hours?  Maybe it's just me, but don't venues have an obligation to ensure their patrons can LEAVE the concert they've just paid an arm and a leg to attend?  Wouldn't it just be good business sense to have your customers leave satisfied?  And how much trouble would it be, really, to have someone don a pair of white cotton gloves, and do the pinwheel arm motion (go go go!) or the palm out motion (stop stop stop!) at tens of thousands of drivers?  What a waste of hosting a truly rockin' concert, Glen Helen, because  everyone  stuck in your parking lot that night would rather get their eyeball caught in a beartrap than endure your particular brand of psychological abuse EVER again.   Moral of the story: if Jennifer and I had to live out the mind-numbing agony of the Glen Helen parking lot, we'd hate to see all our pain and suffering go down without helping our friends and family avoid getting their limbs caught in the meatgrinder as well.  I'm sharing our pain as a public service, a cautionary tale, and a call to action!    Boycott Hyundai.  Shout angry things out your window as you're cruising up the 15--or, at the very least, save those angry fist-shakings for the young whippersnappers who designed the traffic patterns there.  Write strongly worded letters to the proprietors of Inescapable Labrynthine Parking Lots, Inc.  But most importantly: do yourself a favor, and never, EVER buy tickets to any concert at Glen Helen Pavilion.    Think I'm just whining? Blowing things out of proportion?  Flexing my muscles in the Hyper-Bowl of hyperbole?  Try this on for size:     urlLink http://www.nodoubt.com/band/journal.asp?newsID=13454   When was the last time rock stars flitted down from their gilded cage to apologize to  you  for forcing you to take a foretaste of the third circle of Hell?  Of course,  none  of this could've ever happened if we had a decent traffic cop on our cotton-gloved hands...  I'm just saying!  "
21848,3639495,"21,June,2004",2004-06-21,"   (Or at least, Musings Sprung from a KCOP Broadcast, but what kind of sexy title is that?)    I'm watching the Dodgers/Giants game right now.  That is, it's on directly behind me and I keep having to swivel my chair around to catch any exciting plays as I am not an owl and cannot swivel my head around 180 degrees.    Pity.  'Twould be such a fine fan skill.    You'd think it would be a brilliant teaching asset, but the truth is, my students have NEVER seen the back of my head!  I'm of the ever-watchful school of thought.  As far as I'm concerned, the best teaching advice ever is ""You know, kindergarten is like the ocean...you don't want to turn your back on it.""  Trust me, students in kindergarten and junior high are very similar: ready to climb the walls the second you let your guard down.    P.S.  Guess where that brilliant piece of educational theory came from?   Kindergarten Cop  (1990).  You know, that pre-gubernatorial Schwarzenegger flick far more famous for lines like ""It's not a too-mah!"" when the little kid thinks his teacher's headache may be cancerous?  I swear, that's one of the best teaching films EVER--my Mommy and I both love the part where he collapses onto his bed from sheer exhaustion after his first day of teaching.  That's, like, a true-life account of our lives EVERY SINGLE DAY after school.  Brilliant movie, you should go rent it or just sit still long enough for them to run it with umpteen commercials on TBS.  It may remind you of the charm that enabled Arnold to bamboozle California voters.  Oooh, snap!      But the good news is: this is baseball, so I have little need for head-swiveling and plenty of time to write between exciting plays.  Don't judge me, Vin Scully!  You know baseball is slow.  There's no need for constant TV staring like you have to do hockey-style lest you miss a second of excitement.  Strike that.  Like  I  have to do hockey-style. I think normal people are capable of movement during games, trusting in the unbridled goodness of instant replay.    Amateurs.  [By the way: I choose, at this early point in the summer,  not  to whine about the possibility that there may not be any hockey next fall because of a ""strike/lockout nobody wanting to work"" situation.  Look at me, showing restraint!  But I reserve the right to whine in the future, because SERIOUSLY, no hockey for me is like you getting your arm lopped off in a tractor accident.  Or in whirring helicopter blades, like that snarky bald man on ER.  Good times.  End tangent.]  Tied at 2, bottom of the ninth, Giants have a runner on first, in case you're curious.  Hey, guess what?    You are a  GRAMMAR GOD !   If your mission in life is not already to preserve the English tongue, it should be. Congratulations and thank you!    urlLink   How grammatically sound are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    Yea, me!  Frankly, it would be bad news for my students if it didn't say that, right?  That's from a grammar quiz that my friend Laura mentioned on  her  blog:   urlLink http://www.livejournal.com/users/tree_and_flower                                        I may be a divine grammarian, but WE (the Dodgers, remember that's how this started?  Oh, yeah!) just walked two guys, 'cuz we do that, so now bases are loaded.  Dumb.  I wish I had angry sports voodoo like my Great-Aunt Mary.  She rocked the crazy mojo or juju or whatever you prefer to call it.  She'd sit at the kitchen table, pushing string beans through this tiny razor-like contraption that split them into skinny little slivers...julienne beans or whatever, while muttering curses in Spanish at a fuzzy TV set or fuzzier transistor radio.  I should go buy a housecoat and some beans.  Maybe I could work up the serious anger with some Mary-like props.        Some guy named Ransom just hit a lame single that my sister could easily stop despite being three seasons rusty with all her softball skills, meaning we lost.    See why I need voodoo?  More than that: see why I need writing to distract me?  But the good thing about baseball, that even Saint Hockey can't offer, is that there's always another chance tomorrow.  Hurrah for hellish working conditions for my boys in blue, off days are for wimps when you get a six month winter break!   Still, boo for making me waste an evening of head and chair swiveling on a San Fran win.  Ewwwwww....  "
21849,3639495,"15,June,2004",2004-06-15,"   ""The time has come,"" the Walrus said, ""to talk of many things.  Of shoes, and ships, and sealing-wax; of cabbages and kings.  And why the sea is boiling hot.  And whether pigs have wings.""  - - from Lewis Carroll's  Through the Looking Glass .   Out of context, that section of the poem has become a charming little cliche for ""I have a lot to talk about"" or ""Gee, I have a myriad of interests!""  In context, actually, it's a bit less cute.  The English teacher in me wants to pique your interest enough that you go look up the whole thing and rediscover some poetry.  Sufficed to say, the walrus and the carpenter are using cutesy small talk to lure unsuspecting baby oysters to their death.    Really!  Check it out for yourself:  urlLink http://www.jabberwocky.com/carroll/walrus.html      And if you're too lazy to read, (well, you wouldn't be having this little exchange with me, now would you?) go rent the Disney version of  Alice in Wonderland .  In it, all the oyster-slaying barbarism is acted out for you by little cartoon walruses (walri?) and carpenters. (That one I know, a la the 70s brother-sister act of ""We've Only Just Begun"" fame. By the way: I make it a point never to sing love songs to my brother--but then again, I  always  make it a point to eat on a regular basis, so I guess Karen Carpenter is not my role model in many things.) Ooh, and the ""barbarism"" has a friendly ""G"" rating, no reading involved.  The time is long since past for me to talk of many things, it's just I finally have the time to do something about it.  And seeing as I'm going to be staying in the teaching biz for at least one more year, I need to have an outlet for all this pent-up writing energy.  While all my colleagues run out into the real world brandishing new Journalism School degrees and an armful of clips to gain entry at elite newsrooms in Boise, Bakersfield and Barstow, I'm left behind trying to get my writing out into the world.  The cult of the journalist, just like any job worth doing, is wrapped up in a major Catch-22: you've got to be published to get published.  In other words,  my  J-School degree means very little on its own.     The Polish side of my family has a saying: ""Find a way.""  It sounds much fancier in Polish, but then you wouldn't know what I was saying, would you?  As long as the writing bug is in my soul...and it's in there good, I tell you...I've got to find a way to get my ideas out there.  So if no one will publish me just yet, I'll publish me.    Really, it's not so silly as it sounds!  Just ask Izzy Stone.  Izzy--officially I.F. Stone--was an amazing investigative journalist who worked just about everywhere in New York throughout the 30s and 40s muckraking to kick up the big stories.  But it wasn't until the 1950s when he started his own paper, the  Weekly , that Izzy was able to make the biggest impact.  His small paper became a cult source of information for politicians, city bigwigs, and just about every journalist at those big papers he left behind because his work was so thorough, passionate, and unfiltered.    That's every writer's fantasy, even if they're too faux-modest to admit it.  So Izzy?  Here's  my  Weekly in weblog form..give or take a steady timetable.  So Dad?  I've found a way.  So everyone I've lured over to this site for a first look at this blog?  Don't let the title scare you off.  Sure, being a demi-Pole, there's bound to be some talk of cabbages.  And okay, being a hockey fan from Los Angeles, there will undoubtedly be talk of Kings.  But beyond that?  Movies, politics, friends, brilliant ideas, complaints, celebrations, half-formed thoughts, real-life, and everything in between.    Get set for talk of many things.  Some of it important, some of it Seinfeldianly insignificant, but all of it pure, unfiltered me.  Cheer, cower in fear, scratch your head, read, skim or ignore...but know this: the time has definitely come!    I can only hope this opening post strikes you as a charming little cliche to let you know I have lots to say, and not a sunny diversion just before I lead you into a barbaric slaughter by unchecked rambling that even those poor, devoured baby oysters wouldn't envy...

21850,3639495,"02,July,2004",2004-07-02,"   Hey...I hear those people who are able to regularly update their blogs do so because they actually PUBLISH things, rather than building one epic rant piece over several evenings.   I guess it's time for  VH1's Behind the Blog: Maimed Snail .  Reliving the parking lot experience kept making my mind so weary, I'd fall asleep.  It happened, like, four days in a row.  Uncool.  Must get better at this.  Okay, that's all.  Happy Fourth of July, everyone.  Happy 228th birthday, Declaration of Independence.  Only a John Han-cocky person like me would bother taking up so much room on an uberimportant historical document, or take up so much room in your busy day reading a fulmination on the poor driving habits of dirt people.  Ugh.  The thought still gives me chills.  If you don't think Hancock was an obnoxious fellow for writing so big, then you must have the proper tolerance for me.    If so, read on...  "
21851,3639495,"10,August,2004",2004-08-10,"   So, with an eye on dusting off old rants and raves (see: August 9th for the full-on blustering explanation of why these old ideas are just finishing now), here's one bit of schlock I started way back on July 16th...     Check this out:      ""Five charming sisters on the gayest, merriest manhunt that ever snared a bewildered bachelor! Girls! Take a lesson from these husband hunters!""    -- An honest-to-Pete quote from the honest-to-Pete trailer for the 1940 version of  Pride and Prejudice , starring Greer Garson and Sir Laurence Olivier.   Wouldn't I love to take credit for finding that gem on my own? If only. Actually, I just finished reading  The Jane Austen Book Club , by Karen Joy Fowler, and she has this whole Reader's Guide worked out in the last 40 pages of her novel with 200 years of responses to about Austen's work. That quote was the definite winner.  [By the way, a close second in the race for pure excellence is ""Every time I read 'Pride and Prejudice' I want to dig her up and hit her over the skull with her own shin-bone."" - Mark Twain, 1898. Note that, as torturous as he finds Austen, he  does  subtly 'fess up to repeated readings!  ...One can only dream that my writing will be so repugnant to the authors of the future that they will long to exhume my rotting corpse to beat me down with my own femur (which is a sturdier bone and could do MUCH more permanent damage than a delicate shin--I know enough of Twain's brilliance to presume he would choose THAT bone instead, given the chance to choose again!)]  So tell me, fellow citizens of 2004: how do you like  them  apples?  Manhunt? Husband hunters? Snaring a bachelor? Taking a lesson from their example?  Oh, the gall of MGM! I'm so shocked!  Right?  Well, I was. Actually caused me to drop the book in surprise and run it to Jennifer for show and tell. ""Can you believe this?"" and the like.  It's condescending and chauvinistic. Tacky and trite.  Not to mention just plain silly.  And then, with an inward gasp of outright horror, I realized something:   I'm  a husband hunter.   Of course  I am. Not only is that idea unsurprising, it's expected. Understood. Implied.  It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single woman in possession of good breeding hips, must be in want of a husband.  That's not the shocking part.  The shock comes in openly admitting such a hideously antifeminist thing. In 2004. With an Immaculate Heart education, no less!  ...that's just NOT done!  Which is a very antiquated notion in and of itself. Subjects being taboo, admitting such a thing is unladylike, everyone's thinking it, but no one's saying it, yadda yadda yadda.  It's ""Elephant in the Room"" syndrome.  You know, like that little dance we all have to do when we try to describe people without reference to race, body type, physical disfigurements, Siamese twins welded to their foreheads, etc.  Instead, we learn to refer to people as, ""you know, that guy who was standing to the left of that girl who was wearing orange that one time?"" Rubbish. When it would be far easier just to bust out with ""I know a man with a wooden leg named Smith..."" without fear of seeming like an a-hole for pointing out his general pegleggedness.  Poor Smith the Wooden Leg. The PC police won't let us speak of him anymore. Curious how being subtle about something is far preferred, albeit entirely less efficient.  ""I'm a husband hunter"" is the PC-equivalent of ""Well, he's black"" on the tact-o-meter. No one with an ounce of class would ever say that.  Which is precisely why  I  can.  Although (to be fair) I'm of a generation that has traded in cotillions for  Girls Gone Wild , so I'm not exactly a pith-helmeted, tranquilizer-totin' big-game hunter compared to some ladies...  And thank goodness for that! But:  Even a person who seems Zen as can be--sitting in her rowboat, casting a line out onto a seemingly fishless glassy pond--is ultimately hoping to pierce through a trout-brain or two herself! Don't be fooled by the lack of outward-bound showiness...hunting is hunting either way; ""getting your hooks into someone"" isn't an expression that appeared out of nothingness!  As I was saying: I  was  shocked when I saw that MGM quote--especially the bit about ""Girls! Take a Lesson!""  Jot down notes, learn their moves step-by-step, do as they do!  ""Ew!"" said I, for that is how I was raised to react.  Except we really do, you know. We take down notes.  Not out loud. Not in any notebook. Not in the secret depths of our girlhood diaries and journals. Not even in a way that we ourselves notice or recognize. But deep down (where we all know those fish are hiding!) we're taking  mental  notes. Imprinting ideas, thoughts, reactions, attitudes, responses deep in the subconscious levels of our brains.  We're using pop culture to program ourselves for future mating rituals. It's all very anthropologically sound. I'm sure, had I the formal sociological training, skills, knowledge and information, I could perform a formal study that would arrive at that very conclusion. We upload tidbits onto our own cerebral diskettes at a teeny-tiny age.  Ergo: everything I know about snaring bewildered bachelors, I learned from watching TV. And movies. Reading books. Or any time I  stopped  singing along with pop music long enough to comprehend the meaning behind the words.  Maybe I never enrolled in Olivier's school of man-snaring, but there's a whole stockpile of course notes coiled deep in my cerebrum from sources as far-flung as  Anne of Green Gables , The Beatles,  When Harry Met Sally ,  The X-Files, The Baby-Sitters Club  and the Colin Firthization of Jane Austen herself.   Pride and Prejudice  went on to be a monster hit in 1940 and is still in constant rotation over at Turner Classic Movies to this day. Most people would credit the widespread popularity of the source material. All apologies to Miss Jane, but that's fantastically naive. Advertising! Pure and simple. Savvy, match.com ""Your ideal mate is waiting!"" SPAM filtered into the inboxes of moviegoers 60 years before email.  In the age of political correctness, the League of Women Voters or Planned Parenthood or Gloria Steinem or Oprah's Book Club would tackle MGM in a second flat for throwing a movie tagline like that out into the open.  That's a bit of a shame. Still, I don't think I'd be comfortable in a culture where everyone felt free to wave their every inappropriate thought about completely unfettered. I prefer to be the only one lacking an internal monologue.  Although I can't have completely abandoned tact...after all, I made it all the way through this post without  once  mentioning MGM's description of their movie as the gayest manhunt ever.  Aw, phooey.  ... almost  made it!  "
21852,3639495,"09,August,2004",2004-08-09,"   Have you ever had someone disappear on you for such an unbearably long time that the morbid half of your brain pauses now and again to wonder if said someone is, in fact, dead?  Yeah. Me too.  Sorry to have been the cause of your latest death-musings.  -------------------------------------------------  Seriously, that would make a  sweet  greeting card. ""Sorry I faked my own death"" and the like. Very popular among Mafia goons, eccentric billionaires and soap opera characters.  Not only am I alive, I am chock-full of interesting things to say and share and contemplate. So why, you may ask, haven't I written for the last month?  Two things, really:  a)  I'M BUSY!  No, really. It looks like I'm on vacation, but I haven't had a free day in a loooong time. And YES, I know I can't whine, MOST jobs never stop at all, blah blah...  Society as a whole has a big ol' chip on its collective shoulder about teachers getting a summer vacation when the rest of the civilized world has to work nonstop. Trust me--not only have we earned our time off, it's the reason why more students aren't killed by their teachers each year in an act of frustrated rage.   Know how I know? 'Cuz golly by golly, that almost happened to me...but that's another post.  Anyway...even without official work happening, the days keep filling themselves! Sadly, the bank account does not. So in that sense, it will be nice to get back to work, but it is kind of a fun existence being faux-unemployed. Like I could fulfill some excellent professional hobo riding the rails fantasy because I have time on my hands, without falling into actual, crushing unemployment that involves having to search want ads and employ head hunters.  P.S. This is also why, if you live within the sound of my voice (no, really, I'm uberloud, that IS all of Southern California, stick your head out of the window right now and see if it isn't true!) you not only haven't read anything I've written lately, but you haven't seen much/any of me, either. My existence at this point is something of an urban myth. Blurry photographs exist, and a few people claim to have sighted me at the gas station or In-N-Out or something, but really, at this point, I'm like Elvis: only my rabid fans hold out enough hope to believe those stories.  Which brings us to:  b)  I DID WRITE!     No you didn't, I'm looking at your blog right now and I can SEE nothing's been written since July...do you think us totally daft or what?  Bear with me, irritated readers!  I really did write--in fact, right on time, within a week of the last post, I totally brought an entire off the wall essay together, and then I  lost  it! No lie. I went to check a preview of my post to see what it would look like (because I'm so vain and previews are the mirrors of the writing world. In case you're curious, or feeling smart-alecky, YES, I do think that song is about me. I've gone on record several times about that fact!) and when I came back, the page was BLANK. Oh, it was tragic. That was a gorgeous post, it was.  So, I set out to rewrite the thing, and in doing so, a lamentable thing happened: I got too tired to type. Combo of two things: I write very late at night as it is, and I was frustrated at not being able to replicate the gorgeousness of the OG post. Which is when I discovered a VERY dangerous thing:    Save as Draft   As in...start this now, come back to it when you feel like it, I'll hold your place 'til then!  ""Save as Draft"" is a sexy little icon at the bottom of the typing page I use that reassures procrastinators like me and gives us free reign to put FINISHING our work off for infinite mananas.  Very dangerous. Because when I came back, I didn't feel like THAT post anymore, so I started another. Got tired. Saved as draft. Came back. Had lots of good ideas, but really wanted to get this new idea out into the world. Started a third post. Got tired. Saved as draft. Went on vacation. Came back. Wanted to write about the vacation...you know, ""while it's still fresh!"" Got tired. Saved as draft.  Yes sir. Yes ma'am. I have four works-in-progress on my behind-the-scenes page. And remember than unfinished for me is like an encyclopedia for a normal kid, so we're talking about a decent chunk of hidden work.    See , I'm  not  a nasty old liar. I  did  write. I just never got around to actually PUBLISHING, is all.   Oh. That's an important step, I guess.  So what did I do when I signed on this evening? Why, started a fifth post, of course! You see, I needed to explain what all this silence from the cabbage-front was about. But fear not, loyal readers: I'm not allowed to Save as Draft here...I need to be strong and face my fear of endings.  As school is starting again soon, I have to pull together all my summer vacation loose ends--and THIS is one of them. Hidden work must be given a chance to play in the sunshine!   Stay tuned over the next week for posts on: 1) Why sexism is really quite refreshing, 2) The worst form of psychological torture, 3) The future will be a scary place, 4) The band so incredible I asked security to rebound my poorly thrown panties back toward the stage.  I kid you not.  And as I do better with deadlines, even artificial ones, I figure if I finish up one unfinished symphony per night, I'll be all caught up by the weekend. Which should give me plenty of time to write one more new thing: ""Germans: Not just for world domination anymore!""  And then, seriously: don't ever expect that kind of flurry of activity from me ever again. Once a week is plenty, thanks!  Please consider this my contract with you, dear readers. Then, if I don't deliver...you can come after me with a pitchfork and lit torches.  Until then!  "

16339,3642942,"15,June,2004",2004-06-15,"   Over the past few weeks, ever since we came back from our honeymoon, ""how is married life so far?"" seems to be the question I get asked the most.  ""So far so good."" comes naturally as my standard answer. Yet a bit of reflection makes me understand that this is not just a simple clichÃ© comical commentary on the current situation of marriages in the country. This answer has slowly been brewed over years by watching other couples get together, split or sometimes live happily together. The cruel reality of our time.  Yet the cold uncertainty suggested by such an answer is a constant reminder that, in the words of uncle Cesar, relationships work only as good as the work we put on them. Our marriage is â€œso far so goodâ€ not because an inevitable malady has not yet arrived but because we have worked hard, so far, to make it be â€œgoodâ€.  As we move into our second month of marriage all I can hope is that the word â€weâ€, will keep on creeping into my writing so that the ""so far so good"" answer keep on comming, naturally, making people smile as the years go by.

24431,3644724,"28,June,2004",2004-06-28,"   Catchy title, huh?  Now, I am a Yankee girl, who grew up with the notion that roaches are a sign of a dirty home.  I never in my life saw a roach until I moved South where the climate is more inviting to them.  I do the quarterly pest treatment, and feel pretty confident in my housekeeping.  Unfortunately, I am married to a man who sets out a midnight roach buffet before retiring.  My post dinner cleanup includes washing all dishes, wiping/cloroxing down all surfaces, and vacuuming up all crumbs.  Dog dishes are emptied, garbage taken out, and food is put away.  I usually go to bed before DH is done watching Monster Garage/Pimp My Ride/American Chopper/Overhauled.  I wake up to a living room littered with Little Debbie wrappers or a cereal bowl, and a glass of milk or juice on its side with just a tiny dribble leaking out onto my carpet.  The kitchen counter usually has a trail of crumbs or wrappers/empty boxes that just can't make it those last few inches to the garbage can.  I don't care about the cleaning up after DH, but I don't see any point in hanging a welcome sign on our house to my German, Oriental and American ""friends"". My husband mocks my paranoia - he grew up in FL where you can probably saddle up a roach and ride it around the house.  Here are MY experiences with them.  1.  I used to work with a young woman of questionable hygiene, who announced to me one day that she had to leave her microwave outside in the sun.  ""Why?"" I asked thinking it was just one of her quirks.  ""Well, it's full of roaches.  I mean, I can see them behind the number pad.  The sun should kill them.""  Swallowing my disgust, I asked the obvious, ""Why don't you just buy another microwave?""  ""Nah, I can still use this one."" Note to self:  don't eat anything she brings in to work.  2.  We went on vacation to Myrtle Beach, and around 5 am the first morning I felt something on my cheek.  I thought maybe it was a moth or even a fly, but when I brushed it away, it felt pretty substantial, and I could hear it hit the carpet.  I flipped the light on, and saw that it was indeed a roach - ON MY FACE!  After waking up DH and probably our neighbors on either side of our room, I scrubbed myself down, and called around town to get another hotel (not easy during Bike Week).  I waited until 7 am to go downstairs and cancel the rest of our vacation.  I tried to be discreet to the clerk at the counter, but she kept arguing with me that ""That's not a roach.  That's a Palmetto Bug - that's our state bug!""  I've never heard of a state bug - does South Carolina also have state vermin?  Palmetto Bug - a roach with an endorsement - unbelievable.  3.  I have found these critters in my dishwasher, utensil drawer, front porch, back patio, and upstairs hallway.  A sighting - though VERY RARE - sends me into a tizzy that only my sweet bug man, Tim, can soothe.  He assures me that I have no infestation, and that it's just a stray that gets in through crack or opening in the doorways and heads to a water source (hence the dishwasher sighting which now forces me to use the heat dry cycle to nuke any infiltrators).    Truthfully, I really only see these critters outside - where it's to be expected. But I still remain ever vigilant against them crossing my threshold.  As Tim says to me, ""You Northern people sure are funny about roaches!""   "
24432,3644724,"22,June,2004",2004-06-22,"   Ahhhh...summer vacation.  Time to kick back, relax, and have endless fun with my children - just like the pictures in my latest Parents magazine.  The sun will be shining, our yard perfectly manicured, and my children and I will all be tanned and cute in our coordinated summerwear.  Ahhhh...summer vacation.  It's raining - again.  Our ""Simple Set"" pool, is leaning - again - and we're looking at our fifth go around at draining/refilling. My two oldest kids are at each other's throats, and I've finally had to implement the ""kiss and make up"" rule to cut out the squabbling. T-ball has ended, so my contact with other adults will be limited until school starts up again in August.  As for my tan, when I take off my t-shirt at night, it looks as if I'm still wearing one.  No one wants to hear just whining, so here are some of my bright spots:  DS has learned to tie his shoes, DD#2 has learned to walk, and as I type this she is scaling the mountain of books and magazines by my nightstand, and I've taken the first baby steps to pursuing my teaching certification.  Oh, and today, I'm visiting my ""Happy Place"" - Target!  I love Target, as do most other stay at home moms.  I think once we get discharged from the hospital with that new baby, there's a homing device in those hospital issue receiving blankets that propels us to the red bulls-eye.  When I first became a SAHM, I had to watch costs, so I frequented Wal-Mart.  The upside of Wal-Mart is that you can get EVERYTHING you need - food, clothes, tires, etc.  The downside of Wal-Mart is that it's not as peaceful as Target.  If you're escaping from chaos at home, Wal-Mart is chaos magnified.  It is crowded, noisy, and in need of a good cleaning - not unlike my own home.  Target, however, is an oasis of calm.  The minute you step through the automatic doors you are hit with an icy blast of AC.  It is well lit, not glaring, the floor is actually white, items are in order on racks and shelves, and I have yet to see a mother/father beat their child over a Tonka truck.  This is no exaggeration, I can actually feel my breathing and pulse rate go down when I walk in to the store.    Well, I would love to write more, but Spongebob is almost over, and I need to get ready for my Target outing.   "

1662,3646978,"23,June,2004",2004-06-23,    See I knew it would be hard to keep it up every day.  I really have been busy though!  Let's see...baseball Saturday and Monday. My youngest son had his last game in his minor league. He will move up to MAJOR league in the Fall where the boys pitch harder and faster. He is a pitcher now as opposed to a catcher and he is so much happier. He does really well and enjoys it. Then my older son played his last game Monday night. They played 13 games and won one. That was their last regular season game.  Then my dryer finally bit the dust so my DH got a new one last night that matches the washer we got last year. Man does it make a difference! I spent the whole day yesterday cleaning the garage to make way for the new one.  Then last night we took a party over to my grandmother's house for her 80th birthday! I can hardly believe that she is 80. I lived with her quite a bit growing up and it is really hard to watch her grow old. She has had a lot of health problems lately and it is harder for her to get around. She also seems to be losing her memory functions somewhat and she is afraid she is getting Alzheimers.  But we had a great night eating and celebrating so that is good.  Anyway....off to do some stuff.  :) 
1663,3646978,"18,June,2004",2004-06-18,"    My baby is the most beautiful baby in the world. It's true! One look at her and it is obvious. But she is a handful! She has about a fifteen minute limit on time spent in any type of constraint. Exersaucer 15, carrier 15, high chair 15, etc. She either wants to be held or be put on the floor where she can freely explore and pick up loose change, marbles, small bits of paper and legos. She has fully developed what someone called the cheerio pinch with her forefinger and thumb. So now she is able to fetch the smallest item and deftly aim it toward her mouth. I usually watch her like a hawk and catch anything she sneaks in but I did find a piece of paper in her ummm...diaper remains one day. She is not really crawling yet but she can sure move. I am afraid that the pack and play will have to come downstairs soon to contain her. Have you ever noticed that toys hold little appeal to an infant as opposed to smallish dangerous items? My baby likes to play with the strangest things. I gave her a toilet supply line (clean of course) and she spent more time with that than any of her toys! Maybe all toys look alike? We as parents choose the cute bright (expensive) toys that WE like and they take one lick and throw them on the floor.  Kenzie now is the proud host of TWO teeth. They have popped through in less than two weeks after all that time teething! Nothing gives her greater joy than biting my finger with her little sharp teeth.  Aren't babies neat?    mary "
1664,3646978,"17,June,2004",2004-06-17,"    It is late but I wanted to try to stick with making a new post each day.  My son had a game tonight and it was a great game. He pitched very well and only gave up one run. The problem is that we lost. :( But the bigger problem is that my husband fell into the role of coach dad. He was picking out the things my son didn't do instead of what he did. I think I will have to remind my DH that it really is just a game and the bigger lesson is good sportsmanship and trying your best.  I was thinking about that little boy who was all over the news because the jerk man got the foul ball and wouldn't let the kid have it. The kid is like 4 and has no clue what has been happening. He was on GMA and couldn't even sit up on the couch. It was apparent that he didn't know what the cameras were and that millions of people were looking at him. (or maybe he didnt care) Anyway, the guy was a jerk. He should have given the kid the ball. BUT, the kid had no interest in the ball. His mother flipped out and started hitting the guy with her cardboard. (It was very hot that day) I think the guy has given in and said he will give the kid the ball now. All that for a foul ball from the TEXAS RANGERS for pete's sake! It's not like it was Red Sox/Yankees World Series or anything! He is a jerk and the mom was a typical mom and the kid is just another goofy preschooler who probably didn't watch one second of the game.  Have you ever been to a game with a 4 year old? They act like they have a whole MOUND of ants in their pants!   Nuff said Time to go to bed    mary "
1665,3646978,"16,June,2004",2004-06-16,"    One of the things I despise in life is laundry!     I have 6 kids and a husband so my laundry pile just grows and grows. I do laundry like a mad woman and get the pile down way far and then I say ""whew, I can slack off a bit now"" and the next trip out to the garage is like BAM! This huge mountain of dirty laundry! The funny thing is that I am in this group that is supposed to help you get control of your house and chores and all that. I have been in it for years,,,,it hasn't done much! I guess I am just so worn down that when I have a free 15 minutes all I want to do is sit down and zone out!  My youngest child is the most precious 8 month old in the world. BUT she won't nap for more than 15 minutes without me beside her. This severely limits what I can do. She wants to be held or be crawling on the floor. Well, kind of crawling....more like the army training slide.  Anyway, Life is kind of tight right now as far as time.  My boys are playing baseball day and night, my daughter is in a training camp at the military base for her JROTC unit, and then my 5 and 3 year olds are on a constant mission to destroy my house.  Back to the laundry....what is the deal with being able to fold it but not put it away? I have these piles everywhere! Piles on my dresser, piles on my chest, piles on the kitchen table, piles on all the kid's dressers. I had the bright idea to use the dining room table as a folding area since we rarely use it. Do you know how many piles you can fit onto a 5 foot oval dining table? A LOT! So I scrapped that idea. Right now I have two piles on the sofa in this room and instead of putting them away I came over to check the voicemail and then decided to check my email. That's how my life runs. One distraction after another!   Well, the demons just walked in and they look suspicious so I better run. Yesterday they threw toilet paper wads onto the mirror in the bathroom. Fun.     mary "
24259,3647581,"20,June,2004",2004-06-20,"   Well haven't done anything for a while but play my guitar and eat and sleep, its been pleasant but it is getting lonely. So you ever just wish you had that special someone right by your side but it feels like their a million miles away? It sucks even more when you know they could be right in front of your face I wish I could see heather more. Is describe the events of this weekend but I don't have the drive or motivation not to mention it was extremely uneventful. Well that's all for now. "
24260,3647581,"17,June,2004",2004-06-17,"   Today was eventful I played my guitar for the latter of it. As for the rest I helped my aunt move out yes she's moving to Dallas, whish sucks on two levels 1.)now I cant stay over and sneak out to see heather 2.)im actually going to miss that crazy girl. Well I am really committing my self to this musical aspiration of mine and im infatuated, I also cant stop thinking about how awesome today I went, I saw heather last night and at school she just made me laugh over and over she makes me ridiculously happy. I don't know what id do if I didn't have such wonderful person in my life. Im happy content and sleepy... "
24261,3647581,"16,June,2004",2004-06-16,"   In my previous blog I spoke of ""josh"" as a threat and it was by far a mistake... the biggest yet. I trust I wont be mislead and I just thought too far into a friendship but through thorough examinations of myself and chatting with longtime friends I've discovered everyone needs a buddy. I've got mine(mostly my journal and brain) and that's all they are so im sure that's all heather and josh are. Anyway all you indie rock fans out there on June 22 go to www.team-love.com for buttons stickers t-shirts and other sweet goodies from the tilly girls and boys(tilly and the wall). Check out this band world they are coming up them and willy mason hes on the TL site too. So long for now. "
24262,3647581,"15,June,2004",2004-06-15,"   Hello everyone on the information super highway, this is my first blog so bare with me its going to be full of grammatical errors. Well let me start by saying today was eventful...It started last night I slept till about 2:00 a.m  then off I went to go see my ""girlfriend""(the quotation marks are there because I think the title is cliche, and needs a more proper name) it was hectic a 30 minute walk to the edge of the other side of town where I risked getting beheaded by Heather's(my girlfriends name is Heather more on her later) soulless vicious mother or arrested the two are both equally terrifying! I made it wow it was a step and a drudge a step and a drudge the whole way, i first had to get past the hounds now and into the dim room which nestled a heavenly body of which i was more than willing to hold. Anyway in and out by 6:00 we spent the night listening to Bright Eyes first full length effort ""Fevers and Mirrors"" it set the mood for a night full of all sorts of marvelous things. Needless to say neither of us had a full nights rest knowing all to well we had to wake up in about an hour to attend prison i mean summer school but hey we had fun and cherished every moment. I headed back to my aunts as soon as possible where i arrived at 6:32 exactly and slept till 8:00. Now time for school which was fun and full of all sorts of little twists and turns of which I have no passion of typing every single event. So it was all gravy a good day today heather, school, and an evening of boxing my friends for fun and getting the shit knocked out of me. Well that was today in short... But something still troubles me and my mind will not rest until I have someone I can complain to all about how im too jealous and worry about heather spending more time with her friend josh than me. Of course she's grounded from me and anything rob so I guess she has no choice I guess I just wish I made her as happy as he does or at least was there for her but Satan#2 makes that impossible(cute nickname for a older mom type huh?). So I guess ill just call up an old buddy to help me through these times of adolescent wonder, and jealousy. By the way nonantiestablishmentarianism(I think that's the way its spelled, shit I hope that's even the right word) is the longest word in the dictionary...Thanks Johnny what would I do without a friend who can debate politics and chug a beer in the same sit in. "
23906,3650032,"04,August,2004",2004-08-04,"   These pics are from a bike ride to the north of Yonezawa. I was guided around by Andrew (a 2nd year ALT also stationed in Yonezawa), and we spent most of the time following the main river out of the city. I spent much more time biking than taking photos, so there isn't much to show unfortunately. Should be exciting for river fetishists though.   urlLink     urlLink     urlLink     urlLink  "
23907,3650032,"04,August,2004",2004-08-04,"   Here are a couple of shots from a Buddhist temple on the outskirts of Yonezawa.

23908,3650032,"04,August,2004",2004-08-04,"   These photos were taken during my commute to Yonezawa, from Tokyo. I quickly learned that I would have to keep my camera at the ready, otherwise the shinkansens (bullet trains) would vanish out of sight.  There were a couple of varieties of shinkansen that went by while we were there. The two most interesting ones were the ultrasleek stupidly high speed variant (not pictured), and the double-decker version (*sigh* - also not pictured). I did manage to get photos of the type that I travelled in though (hooray!).   urlLink     urlLink     urlLink     urlLink  "

23910,3650032,"04,August,2004",2004-08-04,"   After an 11 hour flight to Narita Airport with 50 or so other JETs, I was shuttled to the Keio Plaza hotel in the Shinjuku district of Tokyo (the bus that took us there was a Mitsubishi 'Powertard' *giggle*). A bunch of orientation seminars took place in the hotel, in an effort to better prepare us for our work and living in Japan. During the orientation there I met up with a ton of different people from around the world and went on random excursions into the city.  Although I only visited two areas of Tokyo (Shijuku and Shibuya), the experience was almost overwhelming. Video screens the size of buildings were common in many areas of Shibuya, spouting advertising for J-Pop, movies, and personal hygiene products. Neon signage crept up to the sky, and all around there was an insane amount of activity. It is however kinda scary how quickly the city changes from cool exciting techno land, to unsettling dodgy porno land without much notice. Although the streets were well populated with people going about their business, there were guys handing out porno fliers every 30 paces or so. Strangely they were all black dudes, and seemed to target foreigners exclusively. Saying 'no thankyou' didn't seem to do the trick so I would instead mention that I was a 'good Christian' and that seemed to ward them off (apologies to the good Christian's out there).  Among other things, I checked out several electronics stores, including Yodobashi. The particular Yodobashi store that I went into in Shinjuku was a 9-story building selling nothing but electronics. There was some really really cool stuff there, but I restricted myself to the purchase of a digital camera. The camera is a pretty swish Canon limited edition 5MP unit. I bought it on my last day in Tokyo so unfortunately I only had a limited opportunity to snap off some shots. I took some from the hotel, looking out of the sprawling metropolis that is Tokyo, and got some of the Shinjuku station and the Shinkansen platform (where bullet trains arrive and depart). Unlike pretty much every other place in the world, the trains here run exactly on time. I was told I would be arriving in Yonezawa at 2:47, and I arrived there at 2:47 on the dot.  The bullet train I took was one of the slower types, but we were still racing along (at a guestimated 150-200kph). The seats on the train were kind of interesting because you could swivel them around through 180 degrees at any time so that you could face the people sitting behind you. It made for a rather intimate seating arrangement (especially for anyone larger than your standard Japanese businessman), but it was really cool.  Upon arrival in Yonezawa city (my new home for the next year or so), I was met at the station by my Supervisor (Kanomata-sensei) and Andrew Clare - a British JET in his 2nd year of the programme, and a really cool guy. They were both dressed down somewhat more than me in my full suit, and with good reason: the ambient temperature was around 34 degrees. The high humidity made things even more uncomfortable as the air was so saturated with moisture that sweat couldn't evaporate.  We high-tailed it to the office in Kanomata-sensei's car, where I met with the entire office and gave my self introduction in Japanese a couple of times. The people were really nice and friendly, doing a cool job of laying out the welcome mat. I filled out a bunch of forms with a little bit of Andrew's help (he reads and speaks Japanese well), and we were given the rest of the day off to look around the city. Yonezawa isn't an enormous city by any means, so bikes are very popular as a mode of transport. I feel somewhat lucky as I have one of the only mountain bikes in the area, whilst 99% of the population ride granny bikes.  An interesting difference between NZ and Japan is that cars are considered to be at the top of the food chain. Next are cyclists, then the lowly pedestrian. This means that unless you are in a car, you best have your wits about you. Another thing is that bikes are allowed on the footpath as well as the side of the road, which is fun if you're on a bike, and less fun if you're on foot.  At the end of my first day, Andrew took me to a 'beer garden' where they have an all you can eat and drink offer for two hours. He was noticed by some of the Japanese dudes there and we were invited to join a party. They were a rowdy bunch but extremely friendly and generous and a good time was had by all. Andrew called up another JET in the region and we met for a few more drinks afterwards.  Something to note at this point are the cell phones (keitai) available in Japan. It seems that the flip open design is the most popular, with two screens - one on the outside of the phone, and a larger screen on the inside. Its also possible to receive TV transmissions on your cell phone - so... err... thats good I guess.  I returned to my apartment around 12pm and set up my futon. I was a little bit anxious, as I had sent my luggage ahead from Tokyo a day ago, and it hadn't arrived yet. It turned out that it wouldn't arrive for another 2 days, so I had to wear the same shirt and socks twice - a rather icky proposition given the climate.  The next day involved some more paperwork and another early finish at around 2pm. We were taken out to lunch by a person in the office for soba noodles which was a first for me. We sat down at a traditional table on tatami mats, and one of the guys started handing out magazines. These particular publications are like Women's Weekly or New Idea, except they cater mainly for men. What this means is that the centre of the mag is porn.  Porn is treated here in an even more relaxed fashion than I was expecting. You can go into pretty much any combini store (convenience store) and the porno section is RIGHT THERE. Another pretty much ubiquitous feature of Japan is the vending machine. These machines are everywhere and stock beer, food, coffee, toys and several other things. The panty machine is as yet elusive, but apparently you need to go to really dodgy areas of Tokyo for that 'privilege'.  I have only had a bit of time to check out the TV here and man its some crazy shit. The advertisements are hilarious and the misuse of the English language makes for some great moments. A memorable example is a music show called 'Barfout!'.  On Friday I spent some time trying to get an 'Alien Registration Card' sorted out. Later on I went shopping with Andrew, to pick up some essentials for the apartment. We also went for a bike ride out to the countryside, riding along the side of a river looking for cool bike trails. We found what looked to be a temple, and went up to the entrance to check it out. We were welcomed in by a priest and were asked to sit and have chilled tea with him and his wife. They showed us around the place, and with their permission, Andrew and I snapped off some shots. The mixture of ancient ways and high technology that defines Japan was deftly illustrated when the priest commented on the quality of my camera, and that he suspected it was purchased from Yodobashi!  After a few more glasses of tea, we said goodbye and set off back towards the city. I stopped off at a video game store to see what was available, and was pretty amazed at the selection, considering that Yonezawa is a relatively small place. The XBox has virtually no presence here, its mostly PS2, or GBA. The store sold a lot of repackaged games and consoles, including some more exotic machines such as the NeoGeoCD, PCEngine, 3DO, and original Japanese NES with disk drive.  It looks like there's a lot of crap software here, but one of the games that caught my eye involved a giant bikini-clad woman, stomping across various city environments and melting tanks with her laser vision. I have no idea what part you play in the game (if any) but it had quality written all over it.  The remainder of Friday was spent watching the annual fireworks show, held just outside the centre of the city. There was some pretty exciting stuff there, and I caught a number of photos and some movie footage on the trusty camera. We went out for Karaoke afterwards, and had a pretty good time running through J-Pop and Eminem tunes with a bunch of people.  Saturday was spent trying to get the apartment sorted out, and I went out to the best place in Yonezawa for sushi with some JETs and their Japanese friends. I feel somewhat guilty that I have been eating out pretty much every night (under the guidance of Andrew-sensei!). The food here is nice, although some of the stuff available in the 'foreign' food stores is a bit pooey. Peanut butter is a gelatinous mess. Most cereals are sugar encrusted cardiac depthcharges. Its just a matter of being persistent and eventually something palatable turns up.  "
23911,3650032,"05,August,2004",2004-08-05,"   Here are a couple of pictures from the Uesugi shrine, a moderately famous attraction in Yonezawa. Apparently the Uesugi clan brought great prosperity to the people of Yonezawa and are still highly revered by the locals. It was a bit late to go running around taking photos, but I didn't let common sense get in the way.  Note that even in the temple grounds, you can still score a refreshing beverage from one of the three(!) vending machines there.   urlLink     urlLink     urlLink     urlLink     urlLink     urlLink  "
23912,3650032,"05,August,2004",2004-08-05,"   Vending machines are cool. I chucked 200 yen (about $NZ3) into one and a cute little robo kitset fell out. The sword is a bit floppy, but its still a neat little toy.  Some of the electronics stores here have fantastically elaborate kitsets, with huge (and hugely expensive) assault suits available.

Some of the features that caught my attention: - Video conferencing functionality - TV tuner - 2 Megapixel camera  Oh so saexay.  Unfortunately, I have to wait until the 16th of August before my Alien Registration Card is available (Vodafone requires this to set up a call plan).  "

Despite being loads of fun (especially when you play with two shuttles at one time), you are sure to end up totally drenched after an hour of play.  Recently, I biked to the onsens in Onogawa as Andrew lead the way (an onsen is a natural hot pool). For someone in better shape, the ride there and back wouldn't have been so bad, but at this stage even marginal inclines are a killer on my body. The onsen we went to was quite nice, although we cut it rather fine when it came time for the change over (when the male only pool switches to become the female only pool and vice versa). Apparently the sight of two gaijin in moderate states of undress was enough to ruin one old lady's day, and she slammed the door behind us as we left.  This sort of moodiness is all the more disturbing in Japan because it is so rare. Ho hum.  "
16888,3654666,"28,June,2004",2004-06-28,"   Everyday is the same.  I wake up assuming that I'm going to have a good day.  It never fails though, by 10AM, my stomach is in knots, my heart rate is throttling about 30% above average and I'm lighting another cigarette.  I've thought about this for a long time and I really don't think I'm over-reacting or delusional.  I seriously think that, at minimum, five people out there exist for the sole-purpose of pissing me off.  What a conspiracy theory that is.  The other question at hand, are the motives of these people deliberate or sub-conscious?  Either way, I'm starting to wear very thin.  I need to find some way to channel all of this negative energy into something good. Is that possible?  I really don't know.  What I do know is the countless nights I go home and just want to be left alone.  Now, this wouldn't be such a problem if I were the only one affected, but there are other people in my life that suffer from my inability to be content.  Oh, by the way, all of you self-help gurus out there, who have suggested breathing exercises to me, screw off and get a life.  Those remedies only work for the poor f*ckers who can't breath and hyperventilate when they get upset.  Yes, I'm thankful that I'm not prone to wheezing.  However, I don't want to live my whole life this way.  Will I ever be completely content?  Am I really asking for too much?  I don't think so.  "
16889,3654666,"18,June,2004",2004-06-18,"   Am I the only person who feels like I'm surrounded by nothing but stupid people?  Have you ever stopped and counted the number of stupid people and then the number of intelligent people you know?  It's completely insane!  Now, I know that I'm not the smartest guy in the world, but I'm constantly being tortured by the misdeeds of the special people, as I like to call them.  They're everywhere you turn.  It does not matter where you are, your bound to be subjected to their unintelligible ways.   And it just so happens; the greatest concentration of these people is your place of employment.  Now, I'm not asking for everyone to have an IQ of 145, but can Wal-Mart or Target please start selling common sense.  I don't know, I always thought that intelligence and common sense came hand in hand.  Maybe I'm wrong, but is it really too much to ask for everyone to at least have one of these traits?  I'm tired of cleaning up after the mistakes and misadventures of these cracker jacks.  What ever happen to the thought of working hard and doing your best?  Of course, maybe they are doing their best.  If that's the case, I pity the children of these buffoons.  Another thing, have you ever noticed that the moron or dumb ass that you went to high school with has not changed?  Is there not a rule somewhere, describing survival of the fittest?  If there were such a thing, wouldn't you think that all of these half-wits would be squashed out?  Or maybe we're spending all of our time and energy catering to these people.  What a concept that is.  "
16890,3654666,"17,June,2004",2004-06-17,"   What a divine pleasure it is to be escorted by a child through the grocery store, well any store for that matter.  Those of you without children have no idea the pain and frustration we go through just to pickup a few items to prepare dinner.  In fact, I envy those of you who are completely oblivious.  Before I had children, I was also unaware that any such phenomenon existed.  For those of you unaware, I have provided before you an enlightening experience.  The excitement begins right after you proceed through the doors.  Instantly, you have two bogies streaking off into different directions.  You catch back up with them and have this crazy idea that you will be able to go about your business.  This is not the case.  You get the two year old into the cart, no problem. However the four year old is a completely different story.  The imagination and level of excuses that he bestows upon you are unprecedented.  He either wants to ride on the end of the cart or walk, promising to behave and not to unleash his wrath upon you.  You have heard this before and make an attempt to levitate him into the cart, big mistake.  You have now awoken what I like to call Satan's minions, because nothing else could create such a horrific sound.  Oh, by the way, this is the part where everyone in the store has now paused to see who is beating there child.  Be smart, give in, and let him walk and be on your way.  First stop, the produce department, you couldn't forget bananas for those little monkeys, could you?  Your thinking now this isn't so bad, right?  Just what you thought, the infamous cereal isle is right around the corner.  This is the second worst area in the store, we'll get to the first later.  A kids dream, more chocolate, marshmallows, and sprinkles than you can shake a stick at.  Did I mention that all of those items are placed on the bottom shelf?  Geez, I wonder why.  Now your being bombarded by two high pitched screaming voices who feel that their world is going to end if you don't get fruity pebbles, cocoa puffs, and crunch berries.  Being the diplomatic guy you are, you attempt a compromise by allowing one box of the sugar filled toxins.  This idea does not go over well.  What do you know?  You now have one child imitating a screaming fire truck and one trying to show MJ a few new dance moves while spinning on the floor.  Once again, you are looked upon as the evil parent abusing his kids.  At this point you throw all three boxes in the cart along with the squirrel, which has been rolling around on the floor and make a mad dash to the check out.  Just when you thought this nightmare was almost over, you've arrived at what you perceive as the light at the end of the tunnel, afraid not.  Not only are you subjected to evil marketing schemes throughout the store your are now faced with and endless array or candy bars, suckers, gum, you name it.  It not over yet.  You now have to children hurling themselves fearlessly over the sides of the cart to get their hands on anything possible.  You try as you might to contain the little monsters while giving the cashier the look.  To those of you who are not parents let me describe the look. Imagine a face filled with helplessness, anger, and anxiety all rolled into one.  You struggle to reach your wallet without releasing your new found prisoners, and hand over the cash.  You are now on your way out the door with two wiggle worms in hand, 3 boxes of cereal, and a bunch of bananas.  In to the car they go, when you know realize that you'll be making an emergency stop at McDonald's, because you somehow managed to leave the store without dinner.  "
16891,3654666,"16,June,2004",2004-06-16,"   Does anyone really know where they are going?  I'd really like to think that someone does.  However, I go through this state quite frequently where I feel lost and destined for a higher purpose.  Right now, there are only a few things that I'm sure of.  I know that I am a father of two beautiful boys that have been an exhilarating force keeping me headed in the right direction.  I don't know where I would be without them.  But once again, I feel like I am at a crossroads in my life.  I have been separated from my wife for a year now and the divorce has been initiated.  This last year has been such a weird experience for me.  Iâ€™ve always had this perception that I was a completely independent person and now Iâ€™m not so sure.  I really have to say that up until about two months ago I was unable to embrace this new life of freedom.  I was unable to escape this endless feeling of loneliness and boredom.  Iâ€™m finally to a point where I feel like my true self again.  Itâ€™s funny how one person can mold you into something you donâ€™t even know you are.  Actually its scary, the whole thought of our lives and existence being so strongly influenced by people who come and go.  Itâ€™s not really a new concept.  I just never thought about it.  So here I am now, feeling free, focused, and more powerful than ever, but what now?  "
16892,3654666,"11,August,2004",2004-08-11,"   If I could pick one movie to portray my workplace it would be Office Space. If you havenâ€™t watched it, I suggest you drop everything and go rent it. Iâ€™ve worked in a lot of different environments, but Iâ€™ve never experienced so much bureaucracy and confusion in one place. Most chaos can be attributed to our ownerâ€™s habitual nature of changing job duties and authority on an almost weekly basis. At this point in time I am the poor fool in charge. This will last until someone else has some bight idea on making the company profitable or until our fearless leader gets pissed off at me again. Either way, Iâ€™ll accept this mission and be happy that Iâ€™m not currently on his shit list.  Our office is made up of a variety of annoying personalities, one of which, a man I like to Mr. Limp Dick. He possesses the most annoying personality of all. He wanders around the office aimlessly, putting his nose into everyoneâ€™s business, and tries to convince us all that he is the office manager. In reality, he is nothing more than a brown noser and tattletale. He possesses absolutely no leadership skills what so ever and is unable to handle any forms of pressure being bestowed upon him. Iâ€™m not complaining about his inability to lead, because this company would be the next titanic if he were in charge. It just kills me that people like himself, one of the special people, have brainwashed themselves into thinking that they know shit, when they donâ€™t know jack. Iâ€™m thinking that the majority of his malformed personality stems from the fact that he inhabited his parentâ€™s house until the age of 40.  I also have the pleasure of working with Amnesia Man, another delusional personality, who makes my day almost unbearable sometimes. He was sane at one time, yet here we have another man whose mind was fucked up by a woman or should I say by her rejection of him and his mommaâ€™s boy tendencies. I would really feel sorry for this pathetic soul if he didnâ€™t piss me off all the time. I have never known anyone who could fuck everything up beyond recognition in the half-hour between him and I coming into work. I depart in the evening and everything is chronic bliss and I arrive in the morning to nuclear meltdown and upon questioning his actions, he remembers nothing of his foolhardy demise. I just really hate it when I am trying to take a proactive approach and trying to make things flow more efficiently, and I have to step back and react to an unneeded disaster and waste of time. It wouldnâ€™t bother or surprise me so much if he wasnâ€™t at one time a great guy to work with, but heâ€™s inevitably lost his mind. Picture a grown man, in just a diaper, curled up on the floor, sucking his thumb and you would understand my frustrations.  Six months ago, I would have complained about working with women. However, we are now only graced by one female presence. You can all say what you want, but when you have two or more women working together in a small office, there is bound to be trouble. Donâ€™t get me wrong, when they were friends all was well, but women are always conspiring against each other. I would get one day of peace and then act as a mediator the next. I finally got fed up with these frequent occurrences and let the claws fly. Needless to say we no longer have the afternoon catfights.  Anyway, though this place drives me crazy on a daily basis and Iâ€™m constantly scanning the web for new employment, I do realize that no workplace exhibits an aura of perfect harmony. I have accepted this hell for the time being only, because of the experience and knowledge that I might gain and who knows one day I might be the all-knowing one.  "
16893,3654666,"06,August,2004",2004-08-06,"   I canâ€™t wait to pick up my boys tonight. Itâ€™s only been three days but I feel empty when there not around. I canâ€™t wait to see Chrisâ€™s constant smile and Mikeâ€™s scheming face. Iâ€™ll arrive at their momâ€™s apartment. Mike will run out the door with cars and trucks in hand yelling some line from Fast &amp; the Furious. Chris does something extremely different yet interesting. Heâ€™ll run towards me doing a combination of running, jumping, and skipping. I really donâ€™t know what you would call that, but I know heâ€™s happy to see me. Their mother weâ€™ll be trying to make small talk, but Iâ€™m completely oblivious to anything she has to say. Iâ€™ll walk them down the hall and out the door to my old Chevy beater. Theyâ€™ll fight over who get to sit next to Dad in the truck, but before long weâ€™re on our way.  Itâ€™s crazy how much excitement they get from my driving. We wonâ€™t even round the first corner and mikeâ€™s screaming for me to squeal the tires. Drive faster and rev the motor up are among other requests that I receive. The funniest part however, is the fact that they think that old truck is the fastest vehicle around, believe me its not. Iâ€™d be lying if I said that I didnâ€™t enjoy it. It kind of makes me feel like God, toying with their reactions.  Iâ€™m not sure what weâ€™ll do tonight. Iâ€™m excited to see them, but tired as hell. I really hate having them one day at a time. I always want them to have the best time ever when there with me. I guess I sort of feel like if they donâ€™t leave happy that unpleasurable thoughts swirl in their minds about me. It wouldnâ€™t be so bad, but when I pick them up on a weeknight and theyâ€™re tired, cranky, or just plain evil, itâ€™s hard to have a good night and then theyâ€™re gone in the morning. Iâ€™m trying to get something arranged with the EX as far as having them for a few consecutive days during the week, but obviously have seen no success thus far.  I know that I shouldnâ€™t worry so much about it, but Iâ€™ve always wanted to be the best dad possible. I want them to know that Iâ€™m in their corner and that Iâ€™ll always be here. The divorce has really got to be confusing for them. I donâ€™t want them to feel like I did and think their dad didnâ€™t love them. It was a real eye-opener to me when Mike was born. At that point, I realized just how much of a piece of shit that my father was to me. I never will understand men that donâ€™t take and donâ€™t want any part in their childâ€™s life. Those kids are a piece of you that will be here long after your gone.  "
16894,3654666,"03,August,2004",2004-08-03,"   First of all, sorry to those of you who have read this blog on a regular basis and have seen absolutely no activity, but I have been busy as hell for the last month. God that was a long sentence! I just moved back in with my parents. Out of all of the things, Iâ€™ve had to do this year; it was definitely the hardest. I felt like a looser at first, knowing that I havenâ€™t had to run back to mom and dad, since I moved out, 6 years ago. I just couldnâ€™t make it anymore, financially speaking. Itâ€™s funny how you go through life, honestly believing that you can make it through any obstacle, untouched and unscaved. It just isnâ€™t so. Through the course of the last year, I have lost my house, car, financial stability, and pride. I fought for every one of those things and inevitably lost. What can I say? I have been struck by the joys of divorce, among other things. Oh well, such is life. I havenâ€™t given up though and I donâ€™t plan on it. So, to all you motherfuckers out there who are trying to break me, itâ€™s not going to happen. Iâ€™ve come to the understanding that anything that holds me back or wears me down only makes me stronger. Iâ€™ve also acquired a new outlook on life. Itâ€™s time to focus on the important things. Iâ€™m going to slow down, absorb as much as I can, and try to live everyday as if itâ€™s my last. My first two priorities in life are Chris and Mike; everything else is just detail. All I can hope for is to influence their lives like my dad influenced mine. Its kind of funny, how I realize now, how much my parents are responsible for who I am today and what I have accomplished. I wouldnâ€™t be anything without them, thanks! Thereâ€™s also another moving force in my life thatâ€™s helped me keep my head above water, she knows who she is, thanks to you also. Its hard to say how the last few months would have fell into place without your reassurance and support. Another piece of enlightenment that I have acquired, is the fact that life means nothing without your friends and family. So here I am ready for anything, refreshed, and never more confident.  "

20137,3655173,"21,June,2004",2004-06-21,"   As of the date of this post, my profile pic is of three dudes wearing interesting outfits standing with their arms crossed. Let me explain.  As I have discussed previously, I am an instructor at Indiana University. I teach Brazilian Jiu Jitsu as well as an academic course, Criminal Procedure. Brazilian Jiu Jitsu is unlike most martial arts which award technical expertise with a Black Belt. Technical (book smarts) expertise in Jiu Jitsu is realized during the early stages of the blue belt level. At this point, a student should be able to speak with authority on the history, benefits, and detriments of Brazilian jiu jitsu (BJJ).   An upper blue belt (I would say 3 and 4 stripers) would be a black belt by most Karate, Tae Kwon Do, and Judo standards if those standards were applied to BJJ. However, this is definitely not the case for BJJ. Belt level promotions are controlled by several factors. First, one must spend at least a minimal amount of time with an instructor capable of promoting. There are relatively few such instructors in the U.S. Next, one must show not only technical prowess, but practical ability! BJJ is an art that allows you to train ""all out"" and test your abilities to their extreme without imposing significant injury to your opponent/partner. Thus, unlike Eagle Claw Kung Fu, we as BJJ practitioners cannot hide behind the statement ""well if we really showed you how much we know, you would be dead."" LOL  So back to the explanation. The man on the left in the pristene white uniform is my friend Kelly Wherley (a.k.a. Que Si, KCDubya, Wherldiggity). The man in the center with the black uniform and a very worn black belt with frayed white edges is Professor Caique. He is a BJJ legend! He is my black belt instructor and friend.  The guy in the blue uniform and blue belt with three white stripes is Me. I had just received my third stripe that day and Caique and I discussed my continued pursuit of my jiu-jitsu goals which include remaining with his team and instruction.  So, I don't mean to hate on other styles of Martial arts, they each address different aspects of what Bruce Lee entitled the 4 ranges of fighting, but I will proudly boast that BJJ is the toughest style to achieve black belt, technical, and practical mastery of, and that is why I love it so much.

20139,3655173,"16,June,2004",2004-06-16,"   YOUR training family   Posted by Tim on Monday, 17 May 2004, at 11:07 p.m.  Today I was reading an article by Royler Gracie (one of the legends of BJJ). He reiterated the importance of forming a quality training family within your jiu-jitsu club.   Let me explain how I view MY ""training family"":   Grandpa Caique: Offers the soundest jiu-jitsu wisdom though he is not physically present all the time.   Greg Lucas: Is like a father figure when it comes to jiu-jitsu. This guy has laid the smack down on me many times and punks me anytime I get cocky!   Chris Hayre: Also a father figure with more patience for my questions than Greg (plus he lets me think I ""earn"" positions on him :))   Kedar: Definitely an older brother(though years younger in age and pounds lighter in weight). Here is a guy who can throw new riddles my way that make me think. We battle hard, have different approaches to the game, but I have MAD respect for the man! Kedar may be the first relevant member of your jiu-jitsu family... he may be your father figure... if so, damn you are lucky! This guy is stellar.   John Hill: Spiritual mentor who helps me keep reality in focus.   Matt Stratta: When it comes to a jiu-jitsu family, this guy is my close brother. He is silky smooth with his technique and has a steele trap mind for the details. In the perfect world, he would be watching every class I teach to remind me to show the one technique I slipped on.   Jeremiah Ashe: I have mad love and respect for this brother. He has helped my game significantly. Laid the beatings down repeatedly, and has the humbleness and control over his ego that we should all aspire to mimic.   Steve Corenflos: Another brother that I feel a strong sense of loyalty toward. At 135lbs, this guy is a tough MF'er! His game is going to get tough the more he trains. Oh, yeah, watch out, this guy is going to Lucas for training! That extra effort will reap him significant rewards!   Paul Hogan: I was ducking you bro! Hogan tough as nails. I am happy to have him in my training family. He has legitimately tapped me freqently. He makes me play my game tightly, and even then it is not enough. At 19 or 20 whichever it may be, he is a force to be reckoned with. I promise that I will reckon that force every chance I get because I get better each time.   Jim VanAtta: New member to the family, but valued nontheless. Jim is strong, wirery, and has great mental prowess when it comes to jiu-jitsu. I enjoy teaching him the moves because his follow up questions force me to rethink the game.   I could stop here and be a very fortunate jiu jitsu student! But to stop here would be to leave out some other very valuable members that I call upon to help me train.   Little brothers include: Will Buck, Ryan Kloman, Andrea Robertson (yep a brother), Lobato, Joe Sunderhaus, Ben Markley, Rebecca Remilard (another yep a brother), Julie Kedzie (though many of you have seen her whip my ass with gloves on!).   I know I have forgotten others, but I trained with Lucas tonight which means I took a beating an my mind is not all there. I apologize.   What I want you to do is find a familial makeup that works for you. Some of you will need to have more brother's than fathers, some of you will be comfortable having many fathers and few brothers. (Gender's can be flipped for the women!)   We are very fortunate to have a jiu-jitsu club that is large and inexpensive. Make the most of it!   Tim   P.S. DTM  "
20140,3655173,"16,June,2004",2004-06-16,"   Preparing for Battle   Posted by Tim on Wednesday, 2 June 2004, at 10:21 a.m.  Currently our club is in preparation for an upcoming tournament. Of course not all of the members of the club are going to compete.   We don't require it! Nor do we expect it!   The strength of our club is the fact that even those who are not going to be competing show up to practice to push those who will be competing. It has been awesome to see the turn out to club practices and the efforts put out by all.   Some of the guys are going to compete to gain exposure and experience and have a good time. This is an important opportunity that competing in practice does not give. Approaching a tournament with this mind set allows one to compete without being concerned about being in PERFECT condition, or feeling superior. One can go with the flow and meet great grapplers, watch awesome matches, and become inspired to work a new aspect of their game.   Others in the club are looking to continue their tournament improvements. Their objective is to confront a rival, place a little higher, or simply survive the first or second round. I emphasize to these participants that conditioning and mat time are crucial.   Finally, there are some in our club that are going to compete to Win. This is the toughest challenge! In order not to be ""bs-ing"" one's self, the competitor must train like a champion. They must train not only their body but their mind. There must be no question that when you step on the mat you are SURE you are going to win!   If you are not interested in competing, don't feel lost or left out. Come help us train! I promise that you will learn some valuable practical concepts by being around. Our competition team will be eternally grateful as well.   So, the date is set, June 26th. The divisions are relative mysteries, so focus on making yourself as prepared to wage the battle you want to wage at the tournament, whether it is just to get some mat time, improve your finish, or take the trophy!   Train Hard and I will see you at club.   Tim  "

Mostly what I want to get out of this is a place for me to dump information that I am feeling, thinking, realizing, or finding useful.   Hopefully this will a great way for me to express myself so that I can come to know myself better and those who wish to know something about me will be able to feel a pulse.

20143,3655173,"11,July,2004",2004-07-11,"   An explanation of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu: >(as posted on my web page two days ago)       Brazilian Jiu Jitsu (hereinafter BJJ) is a martial art that focuses on minimizing the damage done to combatants. Striking of any sort is de-emphasized due to the potential for self-injury as well as the likelihood that the party absorbing the strike will be injured. You may be asking, how can BJJ ever expect to work against a 'real life' angry person who wants to knock your head off? Answer: we carefully measure the distance between our attacker and ourselves. Then we move in to clinch or take-down the attacker to take away the space necessary to employ an effective striking attack.        Once the clich has occurred, or a take down has happened, the object of BJJ is to gain a dominant position on the attacker so as to either 1. convince them to calm down and cease their attack, 2. employ a BJJ attack such as a joint lock or choke, or 3. utilize short range strikes to overcome the opponent.         BJJ is also a sport. Competitors start on their feet and seek to defeat their opponent by gaining a submission (opponent taps the body of the competitor signaling desire to stop the match) or by points which are awarded for positional dominance. Matches vary in length based on skill level, ranging from 5-10 minutes with no breaks.            BJJ is unique in that its moves do not require great strength or speed. (Unlike striking styles, wrestling, or judo). Instead, the more advanced fighters win using a mastery of leverage, baiting, and techniques that emphasize the weakness inherent with the human body. Submission holds focus on the weak joints of the human body, chokes focus on the easy availabilitly of blood sources to the brain to be impeded, and sweeps take advantage of the awkward centers of balance in different positions. Through a mastery of these concepts employed in various techniques, a very small BJJ student can quickly render unconscious or incapable of fighting, a much larger, stronger, and tougher attacker.            Many find the allure of BJJ to be the complex mental components necessary to excel. It has been called 'human chess.' When two fighters are at the same skill level, the one who will win the match will be the one who is thinking more moves ahead of the adversary. Unlike wrestling where a match is ended based on body positioning (i.e. the opponent's back is flattened to the mat), in BJJ you must cause you opponent to submit... they must signal defeat. This can be quite a feat!  Tim 7/11/04  "
20144,3655173,"11,July,2004",2004-07-11,"   Wow, since my last post (June 22) there have been some eventful weeks. On June 26, I competed in the Hoosier Open Jiu Jitsu tournament held in Indianapolis, and put on by Caique and Greg Eldred of Indianapolis Jiu Jitsu. It was a very well run tournament with great competitors. The purple belt divisions saw some great battles as Angelo Popofski took on Mike ""Joker"" Aref of McVicker's Competition Team. These guys battled three times in very technical and competitive fights. Bernie Ash of Louisville's Caique Academy won his Purple Belt division.  I was able to win my division! The first match was a hard battle where I was on the defensive nearly the whole match being down 3-0 very early. I was able to secure a sweep in the last minute of the match and pass the half guard into mount to make the score 6-4.   My second match was against a very strong opponent. I attempted several of my best takedowns to no avail. Finally, he pulled guard. I was able to pass his butterfly guard and secure knee on belly from two different sides making a score of 7-0. At one point he was able to get to his knees and ahold of one of my legs. Just as I had suggested in club, the sprawl drill came through for me. I was able to fend off his attack and front one of my own. I attacked his collars looking for a choke. I tried to get both hooks in, but stayed in control with one. Time ran out with a score of 7-0 me!  I called Angie and got in the car. (She was due any minute)!  That next week we got to meet our sweet daughter! Let me tell you the story:  The doctor told Angie that Friday July 2nd would be the day we could have Angie if we wanted. Everything was ready, we were simply waiting for the contractions. Upon hearing this, Angie got excited and her normal aches and pains decreased. She openly prayed for natural initiation before Friday, but the light was at the end of the tunnel we were finally going to get to see her.  Friday morning Angie woke up earlier than I did, and organized our things. When I got up, I took care of the dogs, and we were ready to go. Upon arrival to the hospital, we both were nervous, but excited. We ascended to the Maternity Ward and met the nursing staff who promptly put us in ""room 5."" It was a nice room with a couch, two chairs, the fantastic birthing (transformer bed) and a stool. The room itself had woodfloors, a large window, and wooden cabinets hiding all of the ""medical equipment"" and monitors.  The room was comfortable.  Angie was put on the typical monitors (One measuring duration and intensity of contractions while the other listened and measured Ella's heart). Almost immediately after being placed on the monitors, the nursed asked Angie if she was aware of the contractions she was having at that very minute. Angie did not.  On time, the Doctor came in and broke Angie's water. From that point to nearly 10 hours later at 5:46p.m. Angie worked to deliver Ella, everything from walking lap after lap of the ward, to intense labor, to about 45 minutes of timed pushing. The process is an absolute miracle (cliche but absolutely true)!  There is nothing like seeing the birth of your child. The first, verified, facts I learned about Ella were that she had lots of hair. In fact, her hair was 'born' quite a while before her head followed.   Another cliche about having children is that they will change your life. I was skeptical, but again, the cliche is true. I realized how heroic it is to be a mother, from the birth process to feedings, women are awesome!   My priorties have shifted as well. I will drop anything to tend to Ella. (This is not characteristic of my steadfast belief in seeing through of planned activities). She is much more important. I am excited for the point when I have adjusted to her presence and can involve her in my activities, but for now, she is running the show.  So, I may post infrequently, but there is a reason. A fantasticly beautiful little squawk box named Ella Delia.  "

I am sure all my colleagues think I am in sane, I sit here groaning and sighing, cheering (not too loudly) at every chance missed and foul, every close call.  I don't follow football all the time (rugby's my game) but this is England, my home my land. I don't know how can explain it any better. I am sure others love their homeland too, but there seams to be something about England that green and pleasant land. An Englishmans belief that God lives there, that almost certain knowledge that whatever happens England will be there.  I know many who might read this will no doubt disagree or even cuss at me. But these last fifty years something has remained dormant, sleeping but if it ever awakes then the world I fear will be shocked. English nationalism.... Many think England a spent force, an empire in decline or gone.  When the English awake, with dreams of empire, then all should worry, all should tremble, for these peace loving English can still bring to bear that mighty sword, bringing down all, be it Hilter, be it Neolpeoan .... England did bring them low in their hour of victory.   I know the above may be pompous but remember well June 18th 1815..... Come on Ye noblest English...   "

I can't vote (not a citizen yet), but I read the papers, watch the TV and have to say that Canada has some of the most incompetent politicians in the world.

9313,3663701,"19,July,2004",2004-07-19,"   Four days and counting until we set off on our biking adventure.  There's so much to do this week between our normal working hours and last minute purchases and preparations.  We also have to practice packing the bikes as they will be on the trip, just to ensure that everything fits.  It's nuts...I can't believe I chose this as my holiday...it's gonna be dope.    In other news, there was a massive accident on the autobahn on Thursday of last week.  It happened directly in front of the exit to our house.  A tractor trailer carrying flammable goods crashed into the support pillar of a bridge and exploded - just like in the movies, man.  The heros of the day were two brave Dutchmen who pulled the truck drivers out of the vehicle before the whole thing blew sky high.  The bridge started to fall apart as a result of the explosion, so part of the autobahn was shut down for the entire weekend.  Traffic jams galore.     We were in Dortmund on the weekend, visiting the in-laws.  Nando's parents are great.  His mom was a home economics/family studies teacher and so whenever we go there she has elaborate cakes made for the Sunday afternoon ""coffee and cake"" session.  She is Betty Crocker and Martha Stewart rolled into one. Definitely the hostess with the mostess.      Europeans really are more cultured when compared to their uncouth North American counterparts.  They regularly eat dinner together as a family instead of everyone grabbing something on the go.  They never drink tea or coffee without a saucer, and they are much more skilled and efficient when it comes to handling cutlery.  Whenever I have dinner with the Laumanns family, I feel like the kid in the jungle book who has been raised by wolves and is reintroduced to civilized society when he's like ten years old or something.  My big clumsy paws are a running joke at the dinner table.  I am praised and congratulated if I actually get through a meal without dropping something on Nando's mom's lovely white table cloth.        Nando's nephew was also there this weekend.    urlLink     Leo and Lulu&nbsp; urlLink      This kid is the sweetest.  He's about 9 months old now.  It's really amazing to see how quickly babies grow.  I've never been around one for any extended period of time until now.  I love being able to play with him and then give him back to mummy and daddy as soon as he starts getting cranky.  I like being ""Tante Jackie"".  I think I will keep it that way for a very long time.  Got loads to do so until next time...  Jaxxx  "
9314,3663701,"14,July,2004",2004-07-14,"   I find it slightly amusing that I've seen more low-budget Canadian films on German TV than I ever have in Canada. It's a given that film making isn't exactly Canada's forte, but it confounds me that the people in charge of programming for the movie channels here would actually buy our crap. How do I know they are Candian productions, you ask? Well, by the usual giveaway of course...the National Film Board of Canada logo that rolls with the ending credits. Until now, I think I've only ever seen the NFB logo on the films I was made to watch as a child in elementary school. (You know...the ones about bicycle safety and saying no to strangers). ""If someone you don't know offers you candy.  Say NO! Then GO! And TELL someone!"" I remember the early days of Jim Carey's acting career from those cinematic works of genius.  In other news...  I had my first visitors in Brausnchweig two weeks ago. It was really nice to see a familiar face. My main Aix-en-Provence partner in crime, Lee, and his main squeeze, Jon, came to visit for a few days of shopping, sight-seeing and reminiscing.      urlLink    Jon, Lee and Jax deciding where to have dinner&nbsp; urlLink     It started out a bit rocky when the boys' flight was delayed by 5 hours. To make matters worse, when Nando and I arrived at the airport, traffic was backed up and there were  ""Polizei""  everywhere! According to the officer that was checking each and every car, terminals A and B were closed off due to a bomb threat! Luckily our visitors were arriving in terminal C.   We spent the next two days shopping, bar hopping and wandering about the city. The weather was grey, cold and rainy (as usual) but I don't think these British boys minded. I guess you get used to that on the island.   On Friday afternoon, we took off for Nando's summer home at the North Sea for some fresh air, even worse weather and pure relaxation. We ate well, drank well, sat by a cozy fire and played Scrabble until the wee hours of the morning.    urlLink    Ferienhaus in Burhave&nbsp; urlLink     All in all, a great weekend. We have a reciprocal visit planned for September so that the boys can show me all around Newcastle.  Can't wait. This weekend it's off to Dortmund to spend some QT with Nando's folks. So, until next time...  J  "
9315,3663701,"13,July,2004",2004-07-13,"   Hello out there...  I've decided to hop on the blog-wagon after my good friend Vickie began her very own blog and graciously decided to send it to me. Why am I creating a blog, you ask? Well, since I don't keep a journal, I think it's a fun way to document my thoughts for future retrospection. It also lets those I love (who are far, far away) know what's going on in my life. Basically, this is how it works: A couple times a week, I will post my rants, thoughts, feelings and observations on the web for all of you to view at your will. You can read and post comments, if you so desire. It's as simple as that.   So...let's begin shall we? I will start with some basics and an update on my ""current situation"".   First off, this is me.   urlLink    Jax - sitting in a pile of garbage at the SARS concert.&nbsp; urlLink     I am presently shacked up with my boyfriend, Nando  urlLink    Nando - car fanatic&nbsp; urlLink     in  urlLink Braunschweig, Germany.    urlLink    Scenes of Braunschweig&nbsp; urlLink     I am working as an English teacher at the local uni and at a private language school. (My German is shit so I can't really do much else). Nando is working on a Phd. in integrated vehicle dynamics (or something) and working for Volkswagen simultaneously.  Smart boy. We live in a cute one-bedroom apartment with our geezer of a landlord (Mr. VÃ¶pel), living above us.  We try daily to avoid running into him, as a quick ""hello, how are you"" soon turns into a half hour monologue about any trivial matter he can dream up.  I wish he'd get some new material...I've heard the same stories a hundred times.  At the moment, life is humming along smoothly.  But I must admit, I miss my friends and family tremendously. I am finding it very difficult to stay close and keep in touch. I hope that this little journal will help bridge the gap somewhat.  I am planning to be back in T.O over the Christmas holidays, but that's a long way off.  In the meantime, I am enjoying all that living in Europe has to offer.  The best thing is undoubtedly the close proximity of neighbouring countries.  Germany shares at least 7 or 8 borders with other countries and they are all no more than a six hour drive in any direction.  And with the insurgence of discount airlines, flying is fast and affordable.  In the past few months, I've been skiing in Switzerland  urlLink    Near Zurich&nbsp; urlLink     and chillin' in the Corsican sun  urlLink    the view from our room&nbsp; urlLink     Over the next week or two, Nando and I are preparing for our summer holidays.  We are planning a three-week bike trip from Oberwald, Switzerland to Aix-en-Provence, France.  We will mainly be following the Rhone River as it winds its way down from the Alps to the Mediterranean Sea.  As this will be my first long bike trip, I am not really sure what to expect other than some breath-taking scenery and a great adventure.  You can be sure you will hear all about it upon my return on the 16th of August.  Well, this concludes post #1.  Feel free to bookmark this link and check back often.   Luv Jax  "
9316,3663701,"16,August,2004",2004-08-16,"   I just returned from an amazing three weeks on the road and am excited to update you all on our adventures. I kept a journal while biking through Switzerland and France and will post one entry per day until all of them have been posted.   So without further ado...   Prelude: July 23rd - 24th   We arrived in Zurich late Friday evening. Flying with the bikes wasn't as difficult as we imagined. Marco met us at the airport and the three of us biked to his apartment together. We spent most of Saturday shopping and buying last minute items. Thankfully, I picked up some kick-ass rain gear that would prove VERY useful on our trip! Revital cooked up an amazing meal for us on the eve of our departure and then we relaxed over wine and great conversation until bedtime.   urlLink    At Marco and Revital's apartment in Zurich the evening before we set off on our trip.&nbsp; urlLink          Day 1: Sunday, July 26, 2004    Daily Stats: Kms - 39.76 Average speed - 23.16 km/h Time - 1:43:02 Max speed - 62.8 km/h Total Kms - 39.76   Today we started our journey from atop the Rhone Glacier (The Furkapass near Oberwald, Switzerland).     urlLink    Jax at the Rhone Glacier&nbsp; urlLink     Marco, Revital and Leo were kind enough to accompany us to the top of the glacier by minivan. (I felt sorry for the poor bastards I saw biking up that thing and was so thankful for the lift). We stopped for a lovely picnic near ""Andermatt"" where Leo had a few laughs on the swings.   urlLink    Leo on swing&nbsp; urlLink      Once at the top, we were able to actually go inside the glacier (for a small fee of course) via a cave-like passage that had been dug through for tourists.    urlLink    Entrance leading into the glacier cave&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    Jax inside the Rhone Glacier&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    Nando and ice sculpture inside the Rhone Glacier&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    We look like we're having fun but we're actually freezing our asses off!&nbsp; urlLink     It was upsetting to see the photos outside the cave illustrating just how much the glacier had receded in recent years (probably as a result of global warming).   urlLink    Rhone Glacier - a wet, dripping mess&nbsp; urlLink     By the time we set off on our journey it was nearly 5pm.     urlLink    Ready to hit the road&nbsp; urlLink     We planned to make our first day on the road a short one. We said our goodbyes, did a final check on the bikes and set off down the side of the mountain at speeds of up to 63 km/h. It was absolutely exhilirating...a total rush!  The scenery in the Alps was just spectacular. I wanted to take everything in but full concentration was needed on the road as the turns were sometimes sharp and we had to be careful of cars and buses.   urlLink    The road that lies ahead - view from the top of the Furkapass&nbsp; urlLink     Once on less steep ground we found the bike path (Route #1) with little trouble and continued to follow the Rhone River. It was interesting to think that we had just begun our journey at the source of the Rhone and had actually seen it as nothing more than a trickle of water. By this point it was still pretty narrow, however it had changed from a clear blue to a cloudy jade colour.   urlLink    The Rhone becomes a real river&nbsp; urlLink     On our way, we ran into a short but extremely steep hill that posed somewhat of a problem. The back end of the bikes were so heavy that the front end came off the ground when we tried to ride the bikes up the hill. We were forced to push the bikes to the top (brutal). In the process, Nando gouged his shin on one of the peddals and began bleeding profusely...ouch. We took a quick rest at the top and then continued on toward Fiesch where we were planning to camp for the night.  The countryside was peaceful and we enjoyed the quiet solitude of the ride at dusk.   urlLink    Countryside in the Rhone Valley&nbsp; urlLink     We've just arrived at our campsite,  Camp S'Moosji  , in Fiesch. Since it is our one-year anniversary today, we are going to splurge on a romantic dinner at the Camp S'Moosji restaurant. Woo!   urlLink    Camp S'Moosji at last&nbsp; urlLink     Switzerland is so beautiful. I can't believe I'm here. I wish I could share it with all my friends and family. Everyone needs to see this and photos can't possibly do it justice. Tomorrow will be a long difficult day. I hope it goes well.  Nighty-night...  Jax  "
21013,3667102,"22,June,2004",2004-06-22,"    Well, yesterday was a bust as far as the points go.  I didn't even keep track of them, and I am sure I was a little over.  However, I did not snack at all.  Went to the pool with Liz after work and actually mananged to do 6 laps.  Not one right after the other mind you, but, I did 6.  :)   I will stick with the 6 laps for now, and try to decrease the amount of time between them.  Once I have done that I will add two more laps.

21014,3667102,"20,June,2004",2004-06-20,"    Well, here we are, it is Fathers Day.  A little depressing for me, but, the nice thing is that Liz gave me a little cash to take Gary out to dinner for celebrating both Father's and Mother's day.  Tomorrow I am beginning WWatchers again.  I think I have plenty of wise choices on hand, and I hope to get our pool passes tomorrow during lunch.  I have also started de-cluttering the house.  I decided that just because DH doesn't care about living in a pig stye, does not mean that I have to.  I will de-clutter and clean MY HALF of the rooms as I do them.  Lets see if that gets him moving. "
21015,3667102,"19,June,2004",2004-06-19,"    Hopefully this will be a restfull weekend.  So far, so good.  Found out today that Michael made All-stars, so, he and Gary will have practice everyday this week.  This will actually make it a little easier for me to regulate food etc.  On the food issue.  WWatchers will start on Monday, and I will be off to the store in a little bit to stock up on some things.  Although, I must say, that is the beauty of WWatchers, NOTHING is out of bounds as long as it fits into the points range.  I will however be limiting refined carbs, so, I will need to be sure to get plenty of whole grain bread options for lunches etc. I will be posting my previous days food log each morning.  I am hoping that this will help a little with the accountablility. "
21016,3667102,"17,June,2004",2004-06-17,"    Well, I was going to start this out as a log for my weight loss journey.  I guess that will still be my focus, but, I do plan to use this for other events in my life as well.  Daniel, my older son, just Graduated High School on Tuesday, what a tough time it is going to be, letting him go.  I NEVER thought watching one of my kids leave home to go to school would be so difficult. Oh well, life will go on, without as much humor as before, since Dan is our resident comedian.   Weight Watchers is the name of the game from this point on.  I am really not a fan of flex points, but, I REALLY need to get off this medication I am on.  The only way I will be able to accomplish this is to loose, loose, loose.  I plan on going to get our pool passes tomorrow, so no more excuses about exercise either. "
12153,3668030,"29,June,2004",2004-06-29,"    i have serious problems. i am such a fuckin slacker. i have no modivation to wake up in the morning and it is bad news cause i keep skipping the only case i really should be going to. oh well i am sure it will be fine it is always fine.  i had lots of fun last weekend also. i am warn out from it though. the party was fun but being the cup person sorta blows cause you have to be all responsible. i love going on my roof and the night ended with the roof talk so im happy for that. if you havent been on my roof before you should come over and we can kick it together except for im a huge pussy and am rather slow so you have to deal with that when we go on the roof. everytime im a little less inhibited though.   i am at school i have to write this paper for thursday and i need to interview lynn, naomis old roomate but i dont even know how or what im supposed to be asking because i didnt go to class to ask the teacher today. oops. im gonna email the ta and see if she can email in time to find out what the fuck im doing. (oh incase you were curious im interviewing lynn because its a community psych class and i wrote a paper earlier on homeless women and the second paper is to either summarize 4 more papers on homeless women or interview someone who works with homeless women and lynn does.. yeah)  muffy is in town and that is super exciting. she is coming to chicago tonight so if you wre not doing anything you should come  i would like to note that when i say ""you"" i am referring to any of my friends that read this.  well im gonna go email some TA's sorry this is so boring "
12154,3668030,"24,June,2004",2004-06-24,"    i am at school and i am super fucking tired. i went to bed fairly late after pretending to study. i really didnt study at all i have winged one test and i have another one in 3 hours that is more important so after this blog im gonna spend the next 3 hours trying to stay awake and studyng for the test. my memory is shit so wish me luck.  as you may know jessica explained how to fix the no one can post problem so now everyone can post and please do cause well it makes me feel good.   did i mention how fucking tired i am. i have a problem i think i may need help this. i am addicted to sex in the city. ginny has every episode available on DVD i am on the 4th season now and its just so addicting i find my self making bullshit excuses why i cant go out so that i can just stay at home and watch sex in the city. there are only 6 seasons so im almost done and than ill move on to movies and twin peaks AHHh!  the last few days have been uneventful due to the fact that i have these midterms today. we are throwing that party though so thats exciting. i hope to see everyone there.   oh wait also my brother hooked it up with tickets to the sox vs cubs game at comisky park on friday. realy exciting. it sucks sorta cause a lot of my good friends had to work but its cool cause i feel special. apparently the tickets are worth more that 150 bucks and i am very lucky to have such an awesome brother. me sarah, josh, and kevin got the 4 tickets that i got but than omar rizvi had kevin call me and tell me that he would buy a ticket for 100 bucks and so i told my brother and he talked to omar directly and sold him 2 tickets. im happy that im going with friends. im gonna be so fucking wasted on friday before i even have the party. bad news bad news or good? i dunno but its gonna be fun.  yawn okay im off to read jessica's blog and than go study "

12156,3668030,"17,June,2004",2004-06-17,"    the movie i saw was called Route 181: The South. 181 was the resolution created in 1947 to split Palestine giving 57% to jews and 43% to palestinians. Although jews accepted this, palestinians did not because they felt as if the land was theirs and giving 57% of it to jews would be equivalent to giving 57% of your house to the dude who stoll your car last week. yeah so anyway The South was because it was a three part movie based on geography (which I though was a really cool way to do it) it went through the south, north and center of Israel and the unrecognized territory of the gaza strip and west bank giving personal interviews to basically anyone they came into contact with that would talk to them. it was very interesting because you got a feel of how israelis and palestinians think. unfortunately i did not get a chance to see the center or the north but apparently its on dvd and im going to buy it. the south of israel is predominately israeli and therefore the movie was predominately of one opinion. being palestinian i understood where they were going with the movie. an important fact is that there was two directors of the movie a palestinian and an israeli. so its almost like a joke really. ""a palestinian and a jew decided to take a road trip through israel, the west bank and gaza and take interviews.."" anyway in the south they interviewed an eldery israeli man who worked for the israeli water museum. although they didnt discuss politics in the begining they did discuss water in israel. they asked questions hinted at the fact that israelis have all the water they could possibly ever need while palestinians were living in ghettos without water supplies. once any political talk about the oppresion of palestinians came up the elderly man freaked the fuck out no joke like he turned red and screamed it was kind of scary. anyhow even though i havent seen the other movied i know that when they go to the poor palestinian areas they will touch on the fact that they have no water. i might be saying this confusing but i just think its super cool. i cant wait to buy and finish it. unfortunately the movie can be very very boring i wish they could have made it in one movie instead of 3 but i am assuming it is virtually impossible to film the entire country in one movie. part of the movie is landscape because you watch them physically drive while they film outside from inside a car. you never see the interviewers only the interviewed and the landscape of the country through their eyes.  I feel this method of filming the opinions of the poeple of such a controversial area can be the most unbiased. Although there it still can show a biased view based on the questions asked by the interviewers it also shows random people with all different opinions. I also believe that the questions weren't very biased but I do feel the directors have an opinion.  When i buy the movie i hope that everyone will watch it. "
12157,3668030,"17,June,2004",2004-06-17,"    so i used to have one of these in a time of my life that was very fun and very painful at the same time. jessica has sparked the want to leave my thoughts for others to read. i attempted at choosing about 15 titles for this damn thing and this is the one that finally was not taken. apparently i am very unoriginal. oh well. anyhow hopefully you poeple will read and comment or else this is just not going to last. that is really how the old one died.  i am in the computer lab at school right now. that will probably be where i am when i write these since i no longer have internet. i have class in 15 and so i need to leave in 5 so this wont be to long.   i am taking 3 classes this summer. i have more school in the summer than i did during the year. i have class from 9-4 on T and Th and class from 1-3:30 M, W, and F.

6301,3674747,"07,August,2004",2004-08-07,"   >>>>  Think back to the day when you first laid eyes on her, you found yourself charmed by the way she talks, the way she dresses herself to show off her best features and the way she embraces life with her laughter. It seemed as if a mysterious ""chemistry effect"" has suddenly developed to draw you closer to her.       You two then began to meet regularly, and you discover more things that you admire about her, her clever ideas, her healthy values and the way she stands up for you when others doubt you, you find yourself thinking of her not just as a normal friend, but a very good friend.       It is often during this period that a boy and a gal will start thinking of bringing their friendship to another level. After all, the kind of wonderful experience you have between each other can only become even better if it develops into uniqueâ€¦ no one else seems able to replace her in your heartâ€¦ so both of you agree to go steady and work even harder on the relationship, you guys ""graduate"" to become a couple, and are the envy of the sea of singles.       Howeverâ€¦ at some point in your relationship, you forgot how it all began. You start to take your partner for grantedâ€¦ why can't she laugh in a more ladylike manner? Why doesn't she dress herself more trendily? Why must she assert her views and point out your silly mistakes? Is she really the one for you?       To be fair to yourself and to her, take some time to reflect on your ""love memory"". The ""love memory' contains all the reasons that you fell in love with her right from Day One. It contains rarely accessed snippets of how your life has changed since meeting and loving her.       Pre-steady days, did you heap compliments on her for the brave way she spoke her mind on bullies and snobs? You probably did. Did you like her unusual fashion sense that makes her stand out from the crowd?       Right-o. So why are you criticizing or finding fault with her now that she is your girlfriend? Because you have forgotten the fundamentals of loveâ€¦ like so many of us. You have forgotten the reasons you admired her during the friendship phaseâ€¦ insteadâ€¦ once you went steadyâ€¦ you put your ""love memory"" in cold storageâ€¦       As her boyfriend, you take up a new set of demands and expectations about her. These new ideas are not necessarily better; they could put your relationship at riskâ€¦       A healthy relationship, like learning to walk properly, follows a step-by-step development; you can't possibly become part of a couple if you aren't friend in the first place. Ok, I know some of us break the rule and plunge straight into whirlwind courtship, but how many of those couples can go the distance? Couple hood works well when there is something you like about her (and vice versa), and Iâ€™m not referring to merely the physical aspectsâ€¦ dun think too hard huh!       So whenever your relationship hits a rocky path, don't give up without checking on your ""love memory""â€¦ rediscover the reasons why you fell in love with her, and watch your relationship flourish with a newfound vigor.       Love is to listen to the needs of the other party: giving without asking for returnsâ€¦ overlook the faults and find the plus point of the other partyâ€¦ voice out &amp; say sweet things and express your happiness and words of encouragement for the other party, just like me giving kisses to the person I likeâ€¦ kekekeeâ€¦ putting in effort, keep putting in more time to find the world of loveâ€¦   Give comments....^^   "
5189,3677153,"18,June,2004",2004-06-18,"   I've got waaaaaaaaaaaay too much time on my hands. It's the longest summer break I'll ever have, and on only day two I'm bored. Thought that's probably the fault of these things-  1) Rain, insecent rain!!!!! 2) two huge bruises on my thighs, a nailed wrist and two twatted elbows. Cool bandages though. 3) The fact that everyone appears to have vanished. Hello?  So, I've decided to make this. It's for when things actually kick off. And they will- this summer I've got loads of stuff planned. On the summer soltice I'm off on an uber bike ride from sun up to sun down. Thing is, my other bike mates are either in school, at work or they've got the food tech exam. I'm just praying for good weather- according to the BBC sun up is at 4:36, so I've got to wake up at 4 o'clock. Sun down is twenty to ten. And it's lighting storms. WOOOOOOOOOOOHOOOOOOO! I don't give a toss- I'm doing it anyhow.  The weekend before that it's the southern area championships for our class of boat. Mmmmmmmm needless 5-6 hour drive burning 122kg of carbon dioxide. To put things into perspective, walking for 6 hours burns only 300 grams. But what dad wants, we must do.   Then there's the olympics to watch (sailing and mountain biking only for me), two weeks in Greece ourselves, the national sailing championships (where I'll get 1st junior even if it kills me), my birthday the day after that, then 4 days in the lakes with Oli and Will, home on the results day. Then it's back to the grinder at college.  It's going to be mint, and even if it hoons it down all holiday, I'm going to make it mint. "
5190,3677153,"21,June,2004",2004-06-21,"   This Weekend Thanks To- Big fat waves, surfing, sunshine, rainbows dancing in the waves, talent  No thanks to- Big fat waves, rain, falling in, crap rudder fittings, huge southern prices  Quote of the weekend- Bloomin' 'Eck  OK, I know you're not all sailors, so I won't bore you to fuck with technical stuff.  Getting dragged out of bed at 5am (FIVE FUCKING AM!!!) by an angry father is never a good start to the day. Off and out by 7, my dad angrier than ever, and onto the motorway.  Why do so many people walk their dogs at such unsociable hours? Why are they not in bed?  Anyhow, after enduring 6 traffic jams (howl!) and getting stuck behind just about every slow driver in Kent and Sussex, we arrived at Bexhill-on-Sea (the name says it all).   It's howling a gail, and the sea's rougher than a Barnsley lass. Oh dear.  Throw the boat together (we're late), get out and sail. We survive (just) the huge 6 foot waves, I get soaked through and we finish 5th. Out of only 13.  The evening livened up when we went to the club and joined int eh getting drunk. I wandered round the town (my god, there is a lot of talent on the streets of Bexhill- and some sail!) for a while, and then we headed back to the tent.   The 2nd day was windier, wetter nd it rained for a bit. We were doing ace- and then the rudder fell off! After that we capsized, and so we gave in on that race. The 2nd race of the day resulted in me nearly getting knocked out, and two capsizes which really knocked the energy out of me. But it was fun. We came 9th overall.  The drive home, well, the less about that the better- 2 hours in a traffic jam...  "

It's the longest summer break I'll ever have, and on only day two I'm bored. Thought that's probably the fault of these things-  1) Rain, insecent rain!!!!! 2) two huge bruises on my thighs, a nailed wrist and two twatted elbows. Cool bandages though. 3) The fact that everyone appears to have vanished. Hello?  So, I've decided to make this. It's for when things actually kick off. And they will- this summer I've got loads of stuff planned.   This weekend it's the southern area championships for our class of boat. Mmmmmmmm needless 5-6 hour drive. But what dad wants, we must do. It's looking wet with no wind, and I'm wrecked as it is.

17278,3683867,"17,July,2004",2004-07-17,"   Let me not to the marriage of true minds Admit impediments.  Love is not love Which alters when it alteration finds, Or bends with the remover to remove: O no! it is an ever-fixed mark That looks on tempests and is never shaken; It is the star to every wandering bark, Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.   Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks Within his bending sickle's compass come: Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks, But bears it out even to the edge of doom. If this be error and upon me proved, I never writ, nor no man ever loved. (Sonnet 116)    Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind, And therefore is winged Cupid painted blind. (A Midsummer Night's Dream, 1.1.231-2)    She never told her love,  But let concealment, like a worm i'th' bud, Feed on her damask cheek. She pined in thought,  And with a green and yellow melancholy  She sat like Patience on a monument,  Smiling at grief. Was not this love indeed? (Twelfth Night, 2.4.115-120)     I love thee so, that, maugre all thy pride, Nor wit nor reason can my passion hide. Do not extort thy reasons from this clause, For that I woo, thou therefore hast no cause But rather reason thus with reason fetter, Love sought is good, but given unsought better. (""Twelfth Night"", 3.1.151-6)     Love comforteth like sunshine after rain... Love's gentle spring doth always fresh remain. (""Venus and Adonis"")   "

It's a fantastic book but I have to say it contradicts Christanity. Notably and claimed as a free thinker but in a way a christian I was quite surpriesed and irked by the way this book depicted Christ and about the Holy Grail. Who knows whether it is true or not but I being christian, I'm quite against this ideology that Christ was not divine but just pure human. But then this book certainly could cliam its righteous position of #1 International Best Seller for its great contenta nd suspense. A thumbs up for it. Religiously, it's different.

It is  very noticeable that the more civilized and developed society and country is, their people gradually grow more and more frightened of death. They cannot accept death. They think death as negative and should be avoided which is of course, sadly to them, not possible.

8098,3693380,"14,July,2004",2004-07-14,"   Wow, I just got a phone call from Tiz, my agent and he wants me to do a film with stars such as Billy Crystal, Reese Witherspoon,Keanu Reeves,Jude Law, Drew Barrymore and Arnold Schwarzenegger, haha nice mix huh?  Anyway the film is about a girl(me of course) who gets lost and cant find her way back home because she was on the way to Russia with her family to see her dad who was in the mafia but he quit and ever since he quit people wanted to track him down and so the family decide that the only chance to visit him would be now, so to go undetected they have to find someone with fake passports who can make them some, then hitch rides(on the way encountering several funny personalities) and then when they get there they find that their father (Arnold Schwarzenegger) had turnes into a Yoga teacher for the stars. Well, while they are there people started to get suspicious and the family had to split up, The girl (me) starts on the journey to their meeting point in China in Bejiing, she then meets a guy and falls in love with him but  he turns out to be one of the people trying to track her down but doesnt know she is the one he has to track down. And then it goes to the journey oft the other family members and they get caught before she does and they get locked in a flat. Then the girl finds the town of Bejiing with the help of her guy (bad)  and he realises that shes the one hes trying to catch but since they are in love he helps her to get his family out of the mafia buisness.

31525,3693954,"30,June,2004",2004-06-30,"    JKR has released the title of the 6th Harry Potter book yesterday. I signed up for HPANA yesterday to chat about it. So if you wanna know go to  urlLink Mugglenet  they tell you there. Well, I have a theory so read below if you want but If you don't then...don't.  In OotP Harry was talking to Dudly about beating people up. Here is some of the conversation. ""So, who've you been beating up tonight?"" Harry asked, his grin fading. ""Another ten-year-old? I know you did Mark Evans two nights ago-""... Yes, the Mark Evans everybody in the Harry Potter fandom knows about. JKR hasn't said if he has an important role in the books or not. If you go to  urlLink JKRowling.com  and got to FAQ, there is a poll to which question JKR should answer next. One of the choices if for her to answer if Mark Evans in an imporatnt character or not. Well, here comes my theory, if he is, he may be the Half Blood Prince. He shares the same last name as Lilly did before marrying James. He is also ten years old, which means in HBP he will turn eleven and that is when you get your Hogwarts letter. So, if this Mark Evans is an important character, and if he is a half blood, and if this Half Blood Prince is a person, Mark Evans may be it. Just a theory of mine. An opinion. Please comment about what you think of it. "

It's definitely something genetic because my brother is rapidly going gray and now my sister is starting to find gray hairs as well and she just turned 18.  Grrr.. "
8930,3699072,"21,June,2004",2004-06-21,   There are just some features I can't get installed where I have my journal hosted now.  So hopefully this will be my final move.

8932,3699072,"11,July,2004",2004-07-11,"   The gall of Brad never ceases to amaze me.  He didn't work one day last week and was off on the holiday but didn't get paid for it so his check was short.  He gave me what he owed me for bills but his cell phone got turned off.  I told him he could take mine  to work with him , since I turned mine off during the day anyway.  He's been off for the past couple of days and is never home when I ask him to be.  All I ask is that he be home by 9pm since I have to go over to my parent's house to take a shower since our gas is turned off.  He can't even do that, plus he takes my phone with him (which I never told him he could do) so that I can't even track him down.  Yesterday he took 20 dollars out of my money -- without asking, of course -- and claims he used it to buy food and beer for himself, even though there's stuff to eat in the kitchen.  He's been over at my brother's all day so needless to say, I don't believe that's how he spent the money.  He then has the nerve to ask me to buy him cigarettes in the morning.  I originally told him no because he has 20 dollars of my money all day long yet ""forgot"" to buy himself a pack of cigarettes.  He couldn't do that while he was buying his beer?? Bullshit.  I asked him for receipts from his purchases today and of course, he couldn't provide them.  So now in addition to what he owes me for bills next week, he's got to pony up and extra 23 dollars as well.  I'm starting to get pissed because he's using and taking advantage of me now.  I just think it's really sad when you're reduced to having to hide your phone and money from someone you'd think you could trust. "

6304,3699086,"22,June,2004",2004-06-22,"   Alot of people around here have been bugging me to hear this thing that I wrote. I don't know if it's supposed to be a song or what, but it's kinda cool, i guess. If you want to, go ahead and tell me what you think:  I need one thing to make this right,  To stop this never ending fight,   Between what I feel here in my heart,   And what my mind wants to impart.  I only need on little thing, but a wall stands in my way,  What I need I cannot have, not now or any day. I've tried so long to grasp it, but it still exceeds my reach,  If only it were closer, then they wouldn't have to preach,  That ""It's not worth it, you'll never win,  All that's left is to quit. Give in."" But I won't stop until it's mine,  This one last thing I have to find,  Because just one more thing remains,  To rid myself of depression's stains.  But they do not see that I need them now,  More than I ever have. And how? How could I ever make them see,  Make them once again believe,  That what I feel is true, no doubt, but then, why bother to try? Would it not be easier to hide my face, to turn away and cry? Why do I try, why do I strain,   For what I know I can't obtain? Why must I sacrifice myself this way,  When what I need just runs away? Perhaps it's true, what they all said, That all that's left is to turn my head Away from this foolhardy quest? To just take the whole thing off my chest? And now I see, they're right of course, and have been all along,  I don't need this grief, this torture,  or to write this unsung song.  I'll stop this foolish journey now, because what I finally see,   Is I don't need this childish feeling to be who I am to be.  I do not need this uncatchable dream,  Although my heart wanted to fool me, it seems,  Into believing that if I did not win, that I would lose a part That still has not been touched in me, deep inside my heart.      Well there you have it. There's another four lines at the end, but I have them all scratched out so I can't read them. But anyway......ya, hope you enjoyed it.  "
6305,3699086,"06,August,2004",2004-08-06,"   I am a moron. I just admitted my feelings to her. Every time I do this, it always changes things. Even if they say it won't, it will. So maybe it's me. Maybe I'm the one who changes. You know, sometimes I just think, 'Is anything ever going to come easy for me? Is anything meant to be for me?' But apparently not. It looks like I'm just gonna have to figure everything out and work for everything I get on my own. Not that it hasn't always been this way. But with everything that's going on right now, I really notice it alot more. And it seems alot worse. I wish I could change my circumstances. I wish I could have my life laid out before, and all I'd have to do is just follow the directions. Unfortunately, things don't come so easy. But maybe it's a good thing. I'll probably value whatever I gain or lose a lot more because I'm working so hard for it. If I didn't,  I'd probably feel almost cheated when I reached the end. But that still doesn't make it any easier.  "

It would actually work out pretty well, because then I could focus on cross country. Someone I thought I could get into a relationship with is now a no-go. A girl has a huuge crush on me, and I can't let her know that I know or that I return those feelings. My parents are really riding me, I just had a poem published, I'm getting academic acheivment letters from all over the place, and if I make choices and change things, people get hurt. Not including myself. That's the worst part. Is I'm sacrificing everyone else's feelings, and not mine. Whether I make choices or not, someone get's the short end of the straw. But never me. I never get shafted. I can only shaft other people. Which sucks. I should just quit it all. Everything. Just screw the world.  "

24140,3700421,"22,June,2004",2004-06-22,"   some events are better written down before they are forgotten. like meeting daniel. daniel is hungarian, about my age. we studied together at the university college utrecht and after his graduation daniel took off to stanford to follow a phd program. maybe he got bored of stanford, he arranged a transfer to harvard. still within the ivy league range, i suppose it gives you a kick to have this all on your cv. anyway, every now and then daniel and his polish wife ania fly over to europe and make a short stop in the netherlands. compared to the united states, distances are so small daniel and ania fit several countries in their visits of differing lengths. sometimes i should ask why they always include the netherlands: for the nostalgic thought of having lived here, for the purpose of seeing old friends, or maybe the reason is less poetic and they simply use the cheapest airfare. leaving all this aside, it's always a pleasure to see them. one of those friendships that have a high lasting coefficient.  one week ago i got an email from daniel. the subject line read: what are you doing on thursday? i thought, what am i doing on thursday? since i decided to quit my current job, free time has taken on an air of indulgent luxury. it's not necessarily that i work less, it's more that i'm better able to enjoy every bit of it. i am also more efficient with using my time now that the burden of the job has been lifted off my shoulders. for some time i gave it some serious thought to continue the job while keeping the thought of quitting in the back of my mind, but finally i figured this was not a very healthy approach to life. so i'm quitting and for the time being i have all the time in the world to do things like meeting daniel on a thursday afternoon.   on thursday i took the train to utrecht. the weather wasn't too good, neither warm nor cold, a prototypical day in dutch spring. disregarding the fact that the train takes only 15 minutes to get from amersfoort to utrecht, i decided to enjoy the journey and treated myself on a bottle of coca cola. i also brought a book, another murakami's classic the norwegian wood. i wore my favourite dark green top and thought the setting was perfect.  as i walked from utrecht central station to the cafe we were supposed to meet, one of the nicest cafes in utrecht carrying one of the funniest but also most stylish names 'winkel van sinkel,' i got stopped by a guy with a cheerful looking face. he said: 'hi! my name is daniel! how are you?' i didn't really know what to say. 'do we know each other?' (hesitation on my side) 'yes, of course,' he replied. 'i used to work here and always told you about jesus!' thoughts were rushing through my head: jesus? here meaning on the street? is his name really daniel? but this guy never waited for me to say anything. he went on and on talking, and the more he said, the less it made sense. 'i got some money from my mother and bought this suit! a suit of a hundred euros, a real bargain, don't you think? now i work in a hotel, making up beds and so. you know, the one on the malielaan!' i thought: what the heck the suit and the maliehotel! i know the maliehotel, it has this posh atmosphere around it, and louk always says it's one of the best hotels in town. so i always look a little suspicious: why should i automatically like everything that louk likes? but he has a point, the maliehotel really is pretty. and this guy was in any case very proud to make their beds.  i didn't have a lot of time to spend on this unexpected encounter. after all, i was meeting daniel, the real daniel, in about five minutes at this winkel van sinkel. so i tell this guy: 'the suit looks really good on you. good for you to work in the maliehotel. nice to have seen you again, but i really have to go now.' he stopped talking and after a short pause went on: 'yes, i am very busy. i must go now, it was nice to see you. i am really so busy with the new job and all!' i added one last question: 'are you sure your name is daniel?' 'yes, my name is daniel!' he maintained. 'okay, bye!' when you don't know what to say, an okay always comes in handy.  i walked to the cafe and met my real friend daniel, his wife ania and a couple of other friends. i tried to sketch this story but nobody paid much attention to it, just a weird coincidence, stuff like this can happen. but it did leave some impression on me. maybe i read too much fiction these days.

24141,3700421,"21,June,2004",2004-06-21,"   i call this 'blog spot' the well. the well is a regular feature of murakami's novels and i figured the line blog-spot-well read quite funky, like the song of some old 1980s rock music band. so what is a well? good question, in each of murakami's novels it has a different role, and i choose to use it following the wind-up bird template. a well is a place you go to to sort out your problems. what is more, entering the well implies you accept to enter a different reality, a reality of dreams perhaps, but still very real and promising of a solution. murakami's novels are like david lynch's movies, exploiting the same kind of mysterious playfulness. anyway, i like to think of this blog as such a well. the virtual reality of it forms a charming parallel.  the only trouble is, going to the well presupposes that you're in search of a solution to a specific problem. you know what you're looking for and it's really just a matter of time before you find it. i don't have anything close to a specific problem or question. or better, i just might have too many. and i hate keeping diaries.  so what am i looking for in this blog spot? at the moment i can think of at least one reason, to invest in friendships which are otherwise difficult to maintain. and it gives me the opportunity to write down my conversations with myself.  for more than two years i did an awful lot of commuting to my university, some three hours a day, at least three days a week. everytime i walked home from the train station i let my thoughts lose and talk to myself about different events of the day. i can go on and on complaining about a mismatched skirt and t-shirt to an imaginary stylist, continue conversations with my colleagues, and very often scheme imaginary fights with almost anybody to let go of silent aggressions. the fights and the fashion concerns i like the best.  starting with today. i walked from the train station and thought over and over about my first contribution to the blogger, a very well-intended theme for a change. i was very pleased to come up with the name (the well) and immersed myself in a monologue of wells, problems and virtual friendships. i guess none of what i'd written is as well formulated as when i imagined it while walking. i suppose it usually goes like that with finding the right words. it certainly goes like that with my imaginary fights. angry alone is far more creative than angry face-to-face.  nevermind, so far so good. best regards to my sister and thanks for introducing me to the blog phenomenon! :-)  "
24592,3700686,"29,June,2004",2004-06-29,"   A spectacular action flick, with Killer Whales hunting humans, high-speed hovercraft chases and shootouts. By his own admission, the authors attempt at a Hollywood-style action movie. The hero (Call Sign Scarecrow) is the leader of a military unit that specialises in securing and protecting sites of turmoil. The reason for the strange name - scars that run down from the top of his eyebrows all the way beneath his eyes, along the eyelids. His eyes were cut-out as a mode of torture, and were restored by the miracles of Science, the eye-damage being mostly superficial. He always wears reflective glares to mask them.  The story begins with a research team in Antartica discovering something resembling an alien spaceship in a large underwater recess of the iceberg that holds their ice-station. The news gets out and Scarecrow's team sets out to secure the area. We realise that the dynamics of isolated areas are completely different from that of the civilised world, where even the most friendly nations have only their best interests in mind. And they will go to any lengths to achive it. For that matter, even your own country does not trust you, and would rather get rid of you than have the secret made public.  There are many heart-stopping moments for the hero and his friends figuratively, and one literally, during the many twists and turns the story takes, before it is brought to a satisfactory conclusion. A good read if all you want for your money is thrills and don't care about too much violence and mayhem.  "

24594,3700686,"20,July,2004",2004-07-20,"   This is a very informative book for aspiring MBAs-A chronicle of life during the first year at Stanford Business School. Peter is a â€˜Poetâ€™, and like some of his batch-mates, is uninitiated into the complex world of number crunching and usage of dense formulas. As a result he has to enroll for a pre-MBA Math course, and here begins the journey through the Hell that is MBA.  Peter was previously employed at the Whitehouse as a speechwriter for Bush (VP at the time) and then Reagan. Completely out of depth at Stanford, he has to come to terms with a punishing schedule, working till late at night, completing assignments and preparing for lectures. He has also come to Stanford with the noble purpose of learning for the sake of knowledge, but finds himself increasingly swept towards exam-oriented studies.  The book also gives us insight into the workings of Ivy League institutes. We identify with the misgivings and apprehensions shared by students on the heavy investment they have made in terms of their finances as well as 2 years of their lives in favour of their careers. Though they are students at one of the top business schools in the US, will they survive the ordeal of the course to get lucrative offers from the high-paying corporate firms, or will they find that they have made a terrible mistake by joining this school?  The personal lives of the students are affected, and frequent mood-swings and irritation are common at the beginning. Grades are all-important and the fact that few of the lecturers are young, inexperienced PhDs (some of them with strange foreign accents) makes matters worse. Complaints about instructors fly from the tense students as exams approach. The management appears apathetic, increasing the studentsâ€™ frustration. All of this would ring true at any institute.  The Institute has problems of its own. Being on the West Coast, far away from the corporate hub in the East, there is a constant migration of talent. Why would anyone want to stay in the West coast when they can earn much higher remuneration if they migrate towards Wall Street and fulfill dreams of making it big? As a result the institute has to pick up promising PhD students and train them in the art of teaching. A slow process. Things reach an abysmal level when Stanford ratings fall to a low of ninth place, from second.  Peter also delves into the emotional insecurities of female students. Though they would not freely admit it in public, they are uncertain about how to balance career and family life, about finding partners who are not intimidated by their degree and so on.  Yet life goes on, and Peter and his batch of 333 students somehow manage to plough their way through the course, and towards the end of the first year, their courses become less demanding. This allows them to prepare for what Peter reluctantly admits as the reason for which they were there in the first place â€“ Jobs. Time is spent preparing impressive resumes, discussing with others on each aspect of these, and then revising them. The company representatives come in to present a rosy picture of life as an employee. At the end, the students decide what they would like to take up, and, after the usual interviews, are awarded with summer internships at reputed firms.  Peter himself lands up a job at an investment-banking firm. His relief is enormous, and his apprehensions about whether he would fit into the world of money and business are temporarily cast aside. Yet, he finds that this world is not for him (as do the people who hired him).  The 2nd year of the MBA course is not discussed in much detail, since there is nothing new for the students, and each of them becomes engrossed in their own specialized subjects. At the end of the 2nd year there are 3 categories of students â€“ those who land up the jobs of their dreams, those who do not manage to do it, but still end up with decent jobs, and those who have to rough it out on their own. As you guessed, Peter belongs to the 3rd category. His search leads him to meet eminent people of the business and technology world, like Rupert Murdoch and Steven Jobs. He opts for a career in Television Journalism, and joins Murdochâ€™s firm. Then comes the depression of the early 90s. With job-cuts being the order of the day, MBAs start getting laid-off and the Stanford students, Peter included, are no exception.  Peterâ€™s conclusion is that though a Stanford MBA does little to mould a person into a good, or indeed, successful manager, it does have its merits. The respect it commands in the industry is enormous. In Peterâ€™s own words, the likes of Murdoch and Jobs would not cast a second glance at his Resume, had he not been a Stanford alumni. Stanford also gives students the confidence to face lifeâ€™s situations with dignity and confidence (If I could get through Stanford MBA School, I can get through this situation!).  A very readable book, and recommended for those who want to know what theyâ€™re getting into, by enrolling for the MBA at reputed business schools.  "
24595,3700686,"12,August,2004",2004-08-12,"   Rollicking story of a boating trip that three young men and their dog make. Though the book was written around a hundred years ago, one can identify with it even now! The 3 friends- George, Harry and the author (referred to as 'J' by his friends) take up this exercise for a change from their mundane lives. Of course, they also have fears of age catching up on them and fear that they suffer from diseases with complicated-sounding names! The author's dog Montmorency, always willing to be a part of the excitement also joins in.  The book is a chronicle of their travels upriver interspersed with the author's musings on various topics ranging from the silly, like how entertaining and exasperating it is to observe women towing boats, to events with historical significance like signing of the Magna Charta.  The humour is decidedly very British; the kind that one comes across in books by Wodehouse. Both Jerome and Wodehouse have perfected the art of describing incidents with dry wit, sticking to the British tradition of maintaining the 'Stiff Upper Lip' in doing so.  To be read by one and all! It takes you out of this world into one that is filled with fun and laughter! In Jerome's own words - the world persists in recognising him as the author of ""Three Men in a Boat"", though he has written other books that have far more to offer in terms of literary significance and humour in his opinion.

24010,3715376,"30,June,2004",2004-06-30,"   Well! Its been a few days since I have updated, sorry to all my die-hard yet apparently non-existant fans, but I have been a busy little beaver...   So like I said, on the weekend, I was shipped off to some friends of the family for the weekend, Gitte and Bent, they were both in their early fifties but they were sooo funny, and they have travelled like EVERYWHERE in the world!... ok not quite everywhere, but close enough...   So, I arrived there friday arvo and together the three of us cooked food, sat in the lounge room and drank wine while and spent half the night just talking togetgher which was very nice. Turns out that they both love Les Miserables, too, which was very nice. Which remindes me, I am still waiting for SOMEONE to send me over my copy... (hint hint mum) Anyway, just before we went off to bed, they gave mde a present to remember them by, a dressing gown thing made from real chinese silk with embroided dragons on it, it is soooo nice! They got it when they were in china..... obviously..... OH and I also went grocery shopping with them, and we bought fresh artichokes and ate them for entre which reminded me of our old artichoke plant back home. Which is now 'expired' as the three of us would put it.   So the next day we were up bright and early and on our way to Nyborg, a small harbour town on the island of Fyn. To get from SjÃ¦land to Fyn we had to cross the longest hanging bridge in the world... well, it was ONCE the longest hanging bridge in the world. For about 2 months until the Japanese built a longer one...lol. Ayway, we were there because their son, Kenneth, is in the Navy and his ship was docked their for the weekend so we went to visit him. The boat was very cramped and kind of crappy, I dont know how he has managed living the past 4 months on it!... so we made Swedish pizza for lunch which was super dooper and then went for a walk around the town of Nyborg and looked in an old church... came back to the boat for coffee and biscuits. I ate the buiscuits but didn't dare touch the coffee, the machine looked as though it hadn't been cleaned in a long, long time!... and besides, I dont like coffee... Kenneth took photos of EVERYTHING using the phone camera which was funny. We all made fun of him for it.   So after our boating adventure, we took a car trip (minus Kenneth who had to watch the boat) so a place where Gitte og Bent could stock up on beer (and stock up on beer they did!) and we went to the biggest rock in Denmark, Damestenen (The Lady Rock)of a whopping 42 metres! Not quite as big as Ayres Rock, but well, Denmark is a very small country. Gitte and I had a photo shoot on the top of the rock :) If I ever find the pics I will find somewhere to post them so you can see them...   And second last on our little sightseeing adventure was a castle, I can't remember what it was called, but I do know that it had over 1,000 singular window panes (it said so on the brochure!) So we looked around the castle for a while, it was the nicest castle I have seen in denmark yet, but I have only seen 4. And yes folks, Katie is now part of history, having been to a real, danish castle toilet! I'm sure you all wanted to know that. So anyway...   Then we looked around the castle grounds, and they had a little museum thing with all these old antique cars, very nice indeed! Then Gitte and I needed to pee again so we went on a bold search for the museum toilets... which we didn't find. But what we did find was a secret hallway, called 'Draculas Mansion'... It was like this creepy, really dark hallway thing with crypts and spider webs and creepy organ music playing in the backbround. And at the front it had the story of the real dracula and how the dracula stories began, which was really interesting....   So there were Gitte and I, standing at the edge of Draculas Mansion, neither of us daring to go foreward... 'Shall we go in?' I asked Gitte, clinging to her arm... it was a very creepy hallway... 'Uh... I guess.' Gitte replied. We both took a tiny step foreward. .... .... We both looked at each other. 'uhhh... Lets wait for Bent..' We decided we needed a strong, male presence to protect us from dracula.   So we went back, collected Bent and walked into Draculas Mansion, both us old ladies clinging onto Bent like glue. It was so funny, Just as we were going in, we stopped for a few seconds. Gitte looked behind us and screamed, jumping five feet in the air... which made me scream and jump five feet in the air. This German tourist just suddenly appeared behind us, and because of the rain outside, had a hooded jacket on which in the shaddows looked sooo much like a cape! Lol, anyway, Gitte, Bent, the German tourist and I stod there and laughed for like 5 minutes because it was so funny... i guess you just had to be there!   After the museum, we walked through the gardens. The castle grounds had 4 mazes, although we didn't have enough time to go in any of them. I noticed one of them was made out of bamboo. I thought this rather pointless as you could pretty much see through the hedges... and wasn't that NOT the point of a maze. There was a small tree top walk, where we could walk on little hanging bridges 15 metres in the air, among the tree tops... although certainly not as big nor impressive as the one that was like 80 metres high in Australia, I thought it was still nice. After that we continued our way through the gardens... 'sampled' a strawberry or two from the strawberry patch, and a raw gooseberry... then exited the gardens. Because it was the castles 450th birthday, a single entry fee will automatically come with a year pass... Gitte spelt my name as 'Catie' rather than 'Katie'which I thought was rather cool.   So then on the way back, we stopped at this little resteraunt thing for dinner. Its a quiet little cottage in the middle of a forest, I liked it a lot! Anyway, it was a buffet kind of thing, help your self deal. And we sure helped ourselves! There was soooooooooo much food there, seriously I dont think I can write just how many different kinds of food! So, naturally we wanted to try everything there... and the good stuff we wanted to try twice... we had marinated steak, spare ribs, chicken kabads, curried lamb, baked mini potatoes, fried potato, potato salad, pasta salad... and the list goes on! So yeah, we were very very full indeed when we went back to the car, and I slept until Copenhagen. It was an early night that night, we had a big day! Lol!   The next day they said I could sleep in, they had no plans. Now, I'm not sure what they ment by 'sleep in' but when I got up at 11am, they were all like 'Woooow! Good Afternoon, Jonas!' (they have a joke with this guy they used to know called Jonas who slept all the time... so I became Jonas) It was funny, though. So that day I did not a lot, just sitting around and talking to Gitte and Bent, and then I scrubbed and peeled 50 million potatoes. Fun fun fun! Now, this is kinda strange for denmark, but Gitte and Bent have a little pit fire in their backyard and that night we cooked fresh salmon and potatoes in the fire, and as much as I dont like fish all that much, it was sooo good!   That night I went home with Marianne and Anne and Niels, normal life back at the host families!   Anyway gtg,   Update again another time!   Luv Catie/Katie/Jonas "
24011,3715376,"25,June,2004",2004-06-25,"   This weekend Marianne and Neils are going to a rotary weekend, and due to my temporary loss of host siblings, I'm being shipped off to a friend of the families for the weekend... I've met them once already and they are very sweet, I'm sure I'll have a nice time there. We're going to visit their son who is in the navy (I think) so we'll go down to the harbour and see all the boats which will be nice. So around 4.30 this arvo I'll be moving to another house, but only for 2 nights.   And at 1pm today Im going off to the airport, again, to say goodbye to yet another oldie, Angela. Which I'm sure will be very sad...   I got an email from my host-sister-to-be when I go back to Australia today, v. exciting, I can't wait! She's invited me to visit her and her family in Denmark so I will definately do that :)  I probably wont be on for the next three days, but I'll be sure to update when I get back!  Cheerio,  Katie "
24012,3715376,"24,June,2004",2004-06-24,"   So, yesterday was the summer solstice, or Mid-Summer as they like to call it here. The longest day of the year, where its tradition to go down to the beaches and light huge bonfires and (in the olden days only) burn witches!... but only one problem, there was a thunder storm. All through the day it rained and rained and rained and rained... and even at one point hailed... and just as it was hitting the bonfire lighting time, the rain all of a sudden stopped! And not a moment too soon! So we got our bonfire in the end, although it had to be started with petrol because the wood was wet and then the petrol made this really gross brown smoke stuff... but the point is, we had our bonfire, and we burnt some witches! (fake stuffed witches, but witches none the less) And then just as it was getting dark (around 11.30 pm) everyone was setting off fireworks, very pretty!     So we (me and Marianne and Niels, me hosties) came back to the house and ate freshly picked danish strawberries with vanilla ice cream and watched more fireworks on the tv from Ã…rhus... and at exactltly midnight the rain started again and then the power went out which was kinda cool... so that was my danish mid-summer   Toodles  Kaz "
24013,3715376,"23,June,2004",2004-06-23,"   Looks like I'm an only child for the moment... My sister Anne (16) has gone off to Jutland for the week with a friend from class, and my brother Christian (19) is touring Berlin with his band. So its been nice getting to know the new hosties better.   So... my host family have just finished booking the accomodation to Austria and the Czech Republic, where we are spending around 2 weeks in beautiful central europe! On monday night my host mum and I took a spur-of-the-moment bike trip to the local library to get some travel guides for Prague (they even got a Lonley Planet guide in English for me :D) and we spent the rest of that night reading over the guides together which was quite fun... I am sooooo pumped about our Summer Holiday!!!  Denmark played sweden in the football (soccer for all you non-europeans). If both teams got 2 goals, then Italy would be out of the compitition which is what all us scandinavians wanted... Denmark led for most of the match, but the final score was 2-2, perfect! Ciao Italiano! Next match Denmark plays is against Czech...  Aargh, I can't believe just how fast the past 6 months have gone... its so crazy, and they say that the last 6 months goes the fastest... so before you all know it I will be home again.  ...oh and by the way I think you can register as a member of my site here, so if you figure out how to do that, I would be much obliged!   Cheerio!  Kaz "
24014,3715376,"22,June,2004",2004-06-22,"   Hi everyone! Well, guess whos back from the dead? Ok, not the dead, but at least the 3-months-with-minimal-contact-to-australia phase I was going through... so I have found a solution, a blog (short for web-log) here I can post messages... or if I'm feeling too lazy to type then I can post audio messages so you can hear my beautiful voice again!   So... what has katie been up to in the past 3 months? Hmm... probably too much to write in one simple post, so I'll just skim over the highlights...  1. Euro tour, 18 days in a bus with 57 other exchange students going around europe... my fav. countries being austria and italy...  2. Survived a near death experience involving a faulty safety harness and a 20 story drop on a ride called the 'the golden tour' (or 'den guld tÃ¥rn')... but yes I am alive and in one piece!  3. Moved host families, my new family are sooooo sweet :D   4. Met some of the coolest people in the world... one of whom is going home on saturday :'(  5. FINALLY got around to watching Pirates of the Carribean... very cool movie and I highly recommend it  6. Um... thats about it... I'm sure I've done lots of other cool stuff but I just can't think of it at the moment but when I think of all the other cool euopean things I've done I'll be sure to tell you...  OH and on the 4th of July I'm going back to Austria and the czech republic again with my hosties, w00t!  Anyway, gotta get a move on!  Love yas all, Kaz "
24015,3715376,"18,July,2004",2004-07-18,"   So, this little exchangeable is finaly back from  Austria and Prague with the hosties. Had an AWESOME time, twas lots of fun. So here is a quick scedule of what I did...  &nbsp;   Sunday, 4th July: We figured out the car trip to Austria would take around 14 hours... so logically we would leave at 7pm that night and arrive 10 the next morning. Yes, with 5 people in the car plus baggage and a whole night in the car, we were all looking foreward to the long drive ahead... need I point out my sarcasm? No, it really wasn't so bad really... of course, me being the ever impressive exchange student ended up stuck in the middle seat for most of the trip, but well, despite the fact I had next to no sleep and I was stuck in between Christian with the pointiest most triangular shoulders in the world and Anne who wouldn't know the words 'move-over-your-squashing-your-poor-little-exchange-student' if they came up and bit her in the nose!&nbsp;So after being sat on, poked by pointy shoulders,&nbsp;a long long time, I was rather looking foreward to the end of the journey. However, there&nbsp;was one highlight of the&nbsp;journey. Let me tell you, theres nothing like&nbsp;watching a German sunset at 4 am squashed into the back seat of a crouded car... unless of course you count sleeping, which is&nbsp;in fact what I was doing as the sun came up. I guess all that lack of sleep finally caught up on me! Which brings us to...   &nbsp;   Monday 5th July: After&nbsp;around 12 hours in the car, we stopped in at a truckstop for some 8am breakfast. We were all tired and grumpy&nbsp;but thaks to my 'Rotary Plastic Smile' I managed to come out of Breakfast without biting anyones heads off. So I atre some joghurt, bread with cheese&nbsp;and some with nutella and had a hot chocolat. There was a huge toy kanargoo in the corner. Over breakfast Christian enlightened me as to why Danish people dont like German people. I had known about this fued for a while, but I never knew where the arguemant had actually sprung from. 'Well,'&nbsp;explained Christian, 'Its because they're all big and fat and smell like sausage.' Hmm... yes very good explanatin indeed... but I guess its&nbsp;at about the same level as the why Aussies dont like New Zealanders or&nbsp;Tasmanians. And just to prove his point, the very next person to walk past our table was indeed, as Christian had said, a big fat German... and&nbsp;yes, he smelt like sausage, but then again he&nbsp;was the chef of the cafe there so I guess he had an excuse... So&nbsp;with wide, bright eyes and cheerful faces all round, we willingly&nbsp;squashed ourselves back into the car for the last leg of our journey... only 2 hours thank goodness!&nbsp;     &nbsp;   So we arrived in our little Austrian town, I can't remember the name of it but&nbsp;it was very close to Salzburg, where The Sound Of Music was filmed.&nbsp;We were to stay in a 3 storied apartment type thing with three floors,&nbsp;and we had booked the 2nd and 3rd floor of it, as another family (friends of Neils and Marienne) would also be joining us in austria. We arrived at 10 but we werent supposed to check into our rooms before 3. We couldn't find anyone who worked there around so we just waited and walked around for a bit.&nbsp;The apartment thing was on a&nbsp;farm thing. Also on the farm was a&nbsp;little herd of deer, some rabbits, some sheep and 2 goats (one of which bit me, lol). An hour later at 11am the family, (Henerik, SÃ¸ren, Lars and Nies) arrived, along with the land lady of the place. So we unpacked, socialised, played table tennis (at which i lost badly) ate a BBQ for dinner and then caught up on some much needed sleep!  &nbsp;  Tuesday 6th July: When Niels and Marienn &nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;   To be continued, will get some food now&nbsp;cause I'm hungry)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "
24016,3715376,"04,July,2004",2004-07-04,"   Ok... believe it or not... I have like no idea at all what I actually did on the Tuesday after the 3Â½ hour rotary meeting on Monday.... really no idea at all, which is really quite strange.. maybe I rang someone? No, I honestly have no idea... so lets just skip Tuesday and go to Wednesday...     Wednesday - Today I said my goodbye to my little Jill from Oregan, MISS YOU JILL! So got up bright and early at 11am and was at the airport by 12. However, did not come away empty handed - scored 2 bags of her hand-me-down clothes and some old hair products and that kind of stuff. Woohoo! Ok must of it was olf beyond use but it was free, and in an exchange students world, ...well, now ords can quite describe it. Of course it was sad when Jill had to leave, she is so cool and funny and I will miss her heaps but we will get our newbies soon, so that will be fun... that afternoon I went to see My host Mormor and Morfar (granparents on the monthers side) they are really nice, and speak a little bit of english too which is a plus!   Thursday - Ever had just one of those mornings? Ok this was one of those mornings! I had planned to visit the Danish girl who will be my host sister in Australia. The plan was, be in Slangelse by 2, have lunch and dinner there and meet her family. So, it takes around an hour by train to get to Slangelse, wasn't sure how long it would take to organise tickets and what not, so I set my alarm clock for 10, which would give me plenty of time to be there.   So my morning went like this... mum rang and woke me up at 8.15... and as much as i liked talking to her ai was so tired and really wanted to sleep... so i went back to sleep. When I woke up I looked at my watch... and almost had a heart attack! 11:59! Aargh! I had slept until 12! Ok, I did a quick figure of sums in my head... 2 hours... I had one hour traveling time, it would take me half an hour to get to contral station, 5 minutes to bike to the station... so poor me is left with 25 minutes to be up, dressed and showered! So going into superman mode, I sprung into action... Was ready in just under 25 minutes! Wow, new world record! So Jumping on my bike I pedaled as fast as I could to the station... that us, until I got a flat tire... so I ran with my bike as fast as I could the rest of the way (which wasn't too fast considering i had just woken up and i was lugging a bicycle!)I arrived at the station JUST as the train was leaving. This was just too typical! So I waited 20 minutes for the train... which turned into half an hour as the next train was delayed... so after getting off the central station, I rushed into the ticket office, ordered a ticket to Slagelse... and JUST missed my train there! By this stage I was ready to strangle anything and anyone that came near me... but no I fought down my anger and bought a hot dog since I hadn't had time for breakfast. The next train came in half an hour, and in the end I was only half an hour late which really wasn't too bad!   My afternoon - I was a little nervous about meeting Katrine, what if she were big fat and hairy? (sorry personal joke... i really have nothing against big fat hairy people)But no, she was really sweet. We discovered that we both love the same rock music and we both looove horse riding. We got on really well, I can't wait until she lives with me in Australia!   So we went shopping together for gifts for her mum, as it was her mums birthday. Our spoils of war were - some eyeliner, a pair of white pants, a cd and a shaver. We looked around the town of Slagelse for a while and were just on our way back when it started raining. But not just that little harmless rain... this was fig fat heavy drops of rain, and lots of it too! So arm in arm we sprinted to the public library and took shelter in there for a while and we had fun emailing people from her account, and I was going to show her some websited about shepparton but then the rain stopped so we continued on our way back home. We made it home and I met her sister (i had already met her mum at the station) and had dinner of chicken, salad and potatoes, very nice indeed! Then some of her mum's rellies came over so say a quick happy borthday and we ate cake and stuff...mmmm...danish birthday cake.... then Katrine and I sat on the couch together and I showed her some photos of the family in Australia which was nice, she's looking foreward to comming here.   Then we raided her room and figured out what clothes she would need to take to Australia... and with a 20kg limit on luggage we managed to sort out what she would need! Then Nicholas came home, the brasilian exchangeable staying with their family, came hoe from rome and the theree of us just sat around and talked until it was time for this little piggy to catch her train back home...   And it seemed by bad luck with the danish transport system was following me still... half an hour into our journey the train suddenly stopped in the middle of nowhere for like 20 minutes for aparently no reason... but all was well after that and I arrived home safe and happy and very looking much foreward to hosting our little danish student! "
24017,3715376,"03,July,2004",2004-07-03,"   So, the day after I got back from Gitte and Bents, the last monday in june, I gÃ³t up at 10 and patiently awaited for Claire, my cool danish friend from class who invited me to go to this kick-ass 5 day music festival on the island of Langelands. 2 other girls from Claires swim team would be comming too, so we arranged a little lunch so I could meet them. They were both very sweet girls, and only laughed when it was discovered that Claire and I had... well... 're-arranged' the pizzas we had bought for lunch. Ok... I know the simple rules of gravity say that when you hold a pizza on a right-angle degree, the topping will fall off, but we weren't exactly thinking about gravity when we needed ot figure out a way to transport the pizzas from the store to louise's house on bikes... anyway... it was kinda funny... :D  Anyway, the two girls, Julie and Louise were both really sweet. And Louise has this huge-ass oversized greyhound which is sooo soo cute!   So after that I went home and got ready for the Rotary meeting that night. 3Â½ hours of wholesome Rotary fun.... yeah as if! no, it really wasn't too bad, in fact, I actually kind of enjoyed it! I spent most of the meeting talking to an old Norwegian guy in Danish... which was funny because my danish is soooo bad. And then I spoke to the lady who was Emily (the last exchange student with the TÃ¥rnby Rotary Club) and she was soo nice and said she would invite me over to her house one weekend, which I am looking foreward to because she was cool.   Anyway, signing off for now  Captain Katie "

13053,3719233,"29,June,2004",2004-06-29,"   Well, I just finished reading the March 2004 J.C. Blog archiveâ€¦  [*  wipes brow  *]  Boy-howdy, the onset of the Iraq War sure circumvented the nostalgic nature of the place, didnâ€™t it? --- And yet, in reading it now, less than 48-hours after we turned the keys over to the interim government thereâ€¦ [*  shakes head in recognition (literally)  *] â€¦I have to say that I am truly impressed with the degree of deep insight and suspicion that some of my old JC friends and acquaintances exhibited, even as early as the very first days of the war. --- And itâ€™s also damned ironic that Michael Moore somehow managed to be a topical â€˜go-toâ€™ throughout that particular month-long run-on conversation, particularly in light of his most recent cinematic release (and most notably, the subject thereof!)   My sweetheart, Kathy, commented on something yesterday that I thought Iâ€™d mention:  Apparently, reading the J.C. Blog has been very therapeutic for meâ€¦ hell, perhaps invigorating evenâ€¦ because Kathy noticed a certain enlivened shift in my overall day-to-day deportment, and surmised (I believe, 100% correctly) that it is most likely related to my recent reading habits. --- Just simply being reminded that there was a time, once in my life, where I was completely surrounded by high-caliber cogent beingsâ€¦ and of the free-thinking, free-spiritedness that once coursed and surged within meâ€¦ and of who I was and what I was like  BEFORE  I met Kathy, and was married to a diagnosed sociopath (with multiple personalities, a severe prescription drug addiction, reverse-misogynistic tendencies, and a veritable whoâ€™s-who case of nymphomania) â€“ but thatâ€™s a whole`nuther story â€“ It is as though a weight has been lifted from meâ€¦ and I thank each and every member of the old â€˜sceneâ€™ for helping me reconnect with that long-forgotten part of myself.   Unfortunately, even with this newfound (rediscovered?) lightheartedness and optimism, I fear that my well-honed curmudgeonistic tendencies are here to stay!

13054,3719233,"25,June,2004",2004-06-25,"   Iâ€™m still busy reading ( and I do mean READING - not merely skimming or browsing ) the â€˜Johnson City Storiesâ€™ Blog.  Despite my busy schedule, Iâ€™m now up to the February 2003 archiveâ€¦  WOW! - I had almost completely forgotten what an amazingly talented, thought-provoking, and uncommonly articulate bunch of people were among us back in â€˜the dayâ€™â€¦ and it pleases me to-no-end to see that, despite all self-induced questionable-substance-fueled efforts to the contrary, apparently the vast majority of everyoneâ€™s brain cells somehow survived intact!   Truly; I canâ€™t remember the last time I have so thoroughly enjoyed the act of reading!   So many formative experiences and life-altering (corruptive?) influences derived from my â€˜doing timeâ€™ in JC ( circa 1988 to 1992, or there-abouts ) â€“ I have quite literally laughed to the point of tears upon reading some of the accounts.     Starting the JC Blog e-venue was an EXCEPTIONAL idea!  _____________________________________________    Please forgive the following, but I really have no one else to tell ( least of which my life-mate/almost-but-not-quite-wife of 10-years! )  As a direct result of my recent reading practices, and the subsequent jarred memories that have ensued, I was awoken this morning by a dream that replayed for me, in vivid-technicolor detail, a number of scenes from one of the all-time greatest nights of my lifeâ€¦ and being a tale of wanton lust and debauchery, its romp through my subconscious resulted in some truely momentous physical side-effects.   In addition to a racing pulse and a dead-cold sweat, I also happened to possess  the  be-all/end-all of sunrise statuariesâ€¦ Ladies & gentlemen, Iâ€™m speaking not of mere morning wood here, but rather the sort of remarkably raging erection thatâ€™s (supposedly) unattainable for a man whoâ€™s quickly approaching 40-years of ageâ€¦ `twas a straight-up cast iron coat rack of a boner, I say; worthy of proportional effigy within any-a third world countryâ€™s urban mythology!  ( Let the congregation say 'Amen!' and brother's an sisters, can I get a 'Doy-yo-yo-yo-yo-yo-yo-yo-yoing!' ?  )   Ahhâ€¦ and to the delightful and breathtakingly beautiful young lady who inspired such a provocative salute ( who, for proprietyâ€™s sake, shall remain nameless ), I offer my deepest and most heart-felt appreciation for choosing me that night to share of herself with such awesome expression and hedonism, without even one solitary thread of restraint.   NOTE: Once I finally manage to read all of the archives, and then submit myself for membership at the JC Blog - perhaps, upon request, I might be coerced into recounting the NC-17 version of that nightâ€™s events for ""posterityâ€™s sake"".   _____________________________________________    On decidedly different note entirely:  To whomever it was that mentioned him, I wish to thank you for finally putting a name to the face; one that I have been completely unable to recall for so long nowâ€¦ Josh Morris - To this day I have yet to find another opponent at backgammon of his caliber (or even pinball for that matter).    Yes, despite all of the small-town banality, they were indeed good times!   OK, I suppose thatâ€™s about enough rear-view yammering for nowâ€¦   Cheers! Gonzo "
13055,3719233,"22,June,2004",2004-06-22,"   What can I say?   OK... Right now I'm listening to the MP3 â€˜albumâ€™ version of 'Don't Eat the Yellow Snow' by Frank Zappa, and drinking my third Warsteiner, after a long, hard day of pretending to be a Relational Database Consultant.   For my own personal entertainment, I am about to embark upon what will undoubtedly become an outlandish and mystical journey down Remembrance Quay, over at the Johnson City Blog.   BTW: For anyone who might be looking here, solely in the hope of unmasking meâ€¦ Trust me; my identity is not anywhere near as important as all of the crystal-clear, uncannily accurate memories that I can still vividly recall about those wonderfully twisted misspent youthful years.   Oh, and one more thingâ€¦ The first person to correctly put a name to this enigmatic former JC resident wins their choice of either a Free Rolling Rock Beer -or- a dupe of my prized bootleg VHS copy of Stinky Fingerâ€™s reunion show at Websterâ€™s!

14533,3721842,"22,July,2004",2004-07-22,"   hello all, well i broke my promise and didnt post pictures sunday, but here they are for real this time. in celebration of this coming weekend's beach trip and hopefully crab fest, i will finally post the rest of the pics from my first beach trip with shel and boyle...     thrasher's fries are so good. as you can tell both shel and boyle think they are money. shel is a nice guy. he will probably blog here soon about food that is good. trust me, shel is probably one of the world's preeminent authorities (along with myself) in classic, as well as, modern foodology. im thinking if you ever meet shel, you would have to at least refer to him as dr. shel. anyways... hopefully that was enough shameless plugging of shel that he will continue to read this blog and not cut my readership by 33%. oh by the way, did i mention that shel is very good looking and very much what the ladies want?      anyways, back to the beach trip. the boardwalk is always tons of fun at the beach. here you can see me having tons of fun spraying pirates with water. haha... silly pirates....     well... as you can see after all the fun at the beach, one can get really tired, especially after eating thrashers, grotto pizza, a couple of lemonades, water, a soda... yep its a tough life at the beach.  so that was my beach trip. maybe next week you'll get to see some pics of guys eating crabs. oooh... doesnt that sound delicious?  talk to you all soon. otto  "
14534,3721842,"17,July,2004",2004-07-17,"   sorry the posts aren't coming as frequently as before. once a week is still pretty good right? first off let me respond to some comments... no alan, gmail doesnt mean gay mail or girly mail or g string mail or... galapagos islands mail. it is a free email account from google who owns blogger.com. you get 1gb of storage which is a gigando amount of storage which i intend to fill with pornography, bootleg movies, and illegal mp3 downloads - the only 3 useful things to use the internet for. this is contrarty to what most people believe the internet is useful for.  in fact, practically no one uses the internet for meaningful research, doing online banking, or keeping in touch with old friends. even if people do use the internet for such activities there are vastly more people using it for downloading porn, and illegal movies and music. anyways... thats what gmail is.  right now not everyone can get it. you must be invited to receive it and i hoped that starting this blog might get me one of those coveted invites. contrary to what jd said, you are basically not cool if you do not have a gmail account. it is a known and proven fact that people with gmail accounts are money. they are more likely to be cool, successful, and have a much higher percentage of scoring with insanely beautiful women. so you see jd, it is very important for me and also for you, and for that matter, everyone to get gmail accounts. if we dont get one soon or have to wait till gmail gets released to the general public we might as well shoot ourselves in the face.  ok, enough with that now on to today's pictures... actually i have to go now and take a shower, so i promise tomorrow i will post pictures.  talk to you all soon. otto  "
14535,3721842,"12,July,2004",2004-07-12,"   sorry for not blogging in so long. things have been sort of busy and i have switched to a new computer. its also become clear to me that i will probably not get gmail by doing this so these past couple of days ive been deeply pondering what to do with this blog... and after many a torturous night, wrestling with my inner demons, and searching the deepest depths of my soul... i have decided that.....  the blog must go on....  so loyal readers (sasso, shell) fear not, for more witty, interesting, compelling, funny, light hearted, serious, intriguing, enlightening, intelligent, gripping, and witty, and light hearted and interesting commentary on the issues that matter most to us will be coming soon. there's also been massive interest from numerous readers (sasso, shell) to open up my blog so that others may try their best to provide witty, interesting, funny, serious, compelling, enlightening, gripping, witty, and funny posts. however, this blog shall remain otto's blog because... i have no idea how to change the name of it. in any event... if you want to blog about stuff email me and ill figure out how you can do that. either way... if you post a comment that gets automatically posted on the blog.   so yeah... look forward to guest blogs about pirates and dinosaurs and why they are so money and why ninjas are big fat hurtings... and also blogs about pictures ive taken and maybe blogs about food i've eaten along with blogs about food shell has eaten.  sorry no pictures today. i dont know how to do that with this new computer.  see you all soon otto  "
25310,3722603,"27,June,2004",2004-06-27,"   im going to post a bunch of random stuff now cuz its sunday morning, a day before tour, and im doing my laundry. i am SO cool. after i do laundry, im going to visit my brother at his rehab center place and take him out to lunch then go see dodgeball again. After that im gonna come home, start packing for the trip, then stay up all night cuz i wont be able to sleep. THE ANTICIPATION IS MAKING ME FRICKEN CRAZY.last night, i was thinking of all the places we were going to and i started to get hyper, at THREE in the morning. Tour,THESE ARE GOOD TIMES. so im going to list my hotties, there are many, but ill try to keep them to the HOTTEST HOTTIES, like on VH1. (these arent in any order, just as i start remembering them) jennifer lopez,jessica simpson,jessica alba,NOT BRITNEY SPEARS AND PARIS HILTON UGH AND THAT OTHER UGLY ASS ON THE SIMPLE LIFE,the girl in ""day after tomorrow"", kristen kruek, ur mom, halle berry, keira knightley,the indian chick from ""bend it liek beckham"" oh, posh spice, leah remini, ben stillers wife, lucy liu,charlize theron, the harp player lol. thats it for now but i shit you not, the list continues. booz chauncey "
25311,3722603,"25,June,2004",2004-06-25,"   i liek the wierdest music. for example, to day i went to tower and bought 3 cd's. i got the franz ferdinand cd the d-12 cd cuz i lost mine, then the jedi mind tricks ""violent by design"" if u know any of these groups, you would knwo that none of them have anything in common except for d-12 and jedi, but only cuz they are both rap groups, however, they rap about totally different things. basically, jedi raps about some shit that d-12 is too main stream to rap about, such as the ""game"", cuz if d-12 tried to rap about that, they would be mocked, cuz they alreay made it, whereas jedi is still underground. so, i have a large range of music going from classical(brahms) which in itslef has many different periods to it, to rock(hoobastank) to metal(SOAD) to rap(eminem). rap and classical i say are the best, cuz when combined, u get artists liek jedi mind tricks who are truely, the best of bothc worlds, unlike R kely, and jay-z, BUT jay-z is a sick ass rapper anyways. chauncey "
25312,3722603,"23,June,2004",2004-06-23,"   alright, so i was driving down to san mateo with my mom to go to my brothers rehab meeting, which by the way was lovely(will ferrell from ""old school"") ANYWAYS,and this fucken truck fucken streaks in front of our car, making my mom swerve the car. so at first i was like "" wtf, that almost made me shit in my pants"" cuz seriously, i was frightened for the moment. but soon after, the car that cut in front of us stopped, then started up, then stopped, then started up. THIS CONTINUED FOR A GOOD 15 SECONDS. then this woman raises her fucken crusty hand through the sun roof, flipping us off. LOL, so my mom tried to do it back, but she has tendinitis in her left hand, so it came out as a sort of "" fist"" instead of a flipping of the bird.LOL, but the woman got the point. so the woman gets into the lane next to us, and slows down so that she is right next to ME,talking to me. she says "" you cant just fucken cut me off like that!"" and i rolled up the window and acted like i didnt notice her yelling at us. BUT this made it worse, she got back in front of us. WHOA, U MUST UNDERSTAND THAT WE WERE GOING LIKE 60 ON THE FREEWAY DURING THIS WHOLE TIME. back to the story,  so when she was back in front, she reached for somehting in the backseat of her truck and pulled out a drum stick. then she started twirling it in front of the rearview mirror, LOL, and then she dropped it in the seat, went to look for it, then she changed lanes, and never came back. In the end, i feel sorry for her. She was trying to be all hard and shit, and ended up looking liek a retard dropping the drum stick.w/e tho. I hope i am doing this whoole "" blog"" thing right, cuz i have nothign else to say besides what happened in my day. chauncey "
25313,3722603,"23,June,2004",2004-06-23,"   alright, FIRST OF ALL, my fucken haircut sucks my moms booty crack. SECONDLY, NEVER EVER GO TO SUPERCUTS!  This one time when I was in 7th grade, I went to supercuts right before the year started. I wanted to get like a 2 on the sides and about an inch off my 3 inch long hair on top. However the Asian lady how was about to butcher my hair never really heard what I said. I heard her murmur something along the lines of ""askhfgasjkfgjkg  2 OK! asfdhibasjkgvaha"" so I was like OK, maybe she will give me a much betetr haircut than I was use to receiving. BUT, the fucken woman gave me a 2 all the way around, leaving me with a shaved head. Today, I went in and got my haircut. It wasn't THE WORST HAIRCUT I've ever gotten, but nothing is evenly cut, and there are patches of hair that are much more dense than others. I've gone to supercuts between those 3 years, but supercust just isn't that great of a place. IM sure there are a few hear and there that have actual barbers, but in the end, they just aren't great haircutists. i leave for tour in 5 days. I hella wanted that loyd banks cd, but it comes out the day after I leave. DUDE, i want to see spiderman 2, looks hella good. I saw around the world in 80 days, it was alright, better than expected which is good and i saw dodgeball, SO FUCKEN HILARIOUS. damn, i dont think anyone can capture such moron-ness better than ben stiller. chauncey "
25314,3722603,"22,June,2004",2004-06-22,"   during the school year i was always busy. i usually woke up before school at like 5 a.m. so i could practice for about an hour and a half. after practicing, i would take a shower get dressed read the sports page and datebook, then drive to school. THEN there would be school, which for me, is at Stuart Hall High School which is a really small boys school near japan town. its not a great school, but for me it is perfect. i can co exactly what i want to do which is to get my school shit done, have a few close people that i basically only hang out with all year cuz everyone else is REALLY COOL.... play baseball whihc is the best sport ever next to baskteball and football, and focus on my music outside of school. So for my pusposes, Stuart Hall is fine.during baseball season, i would go to practice everyday after school until about 6, then come home, do my homework, then go to sleep and wake up and practice and condoing that cycle of nonstop madness everyday until now, which is summer time. this summer is really busy for me. i had a recital, which i just finished , and it was a lot better than i thought it would be, then i have tour with SFYO. the SFYO tour is gonna be fucken tight. we're going to france, austria, amsterdam, germany and somewhere else i cant remember. the best part of it is that im going to get to chill with a lot of people i grew up with at TCS, my junior high school. so hopefully tha will be cool. OH YA, weed is legal in amsterdam, so if you're there, look for me in those coffee shops that have it on their menu's............JAY KAY. after i get back from tour, im going to drive down to LA wiht my sister and cousin and go to disneyland for a few days. ok fine, disneyland isn't the coolest place ever, but shit, a roadtrip wiht my closest people is gonna be sick regardless of where we are going.  after the road trip, im going to england which is followd by a camping trip to mendocino to close out the summer. back to "" having nothing to do is fucken wierd"", until monday the 28th, i have jack shit to do. THE ANTICIPATION for tour is gettig to be too much for me to handle. everyday gets longer and longer as each hour seems to last for a century. NOW i realize how easy it is for people to ramblke on and on in these things, so im goign to stop. im sure this is stupid but, it is my first online diary shit post thing ever so have fun. chauncey P.S. fucken lakers.............. GIANTS BABY   YEAEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH "
25315,3722603,"28,July,2004",2004-07-28,"   So i was talking to this guy and he was like,"" OH MY GOD, how long does it take a black woman to take a shit?"" I, along with all the other ""PC"" people i was standing with did not move a muscle. "" 9 MONTHS. HAHA isn't that funny?"" I had to keep my dumbass from wetting myself in the pants. That could possibly be one of the most racist, offensive HILARIOUS jokes i've ever heard. ANYWAYS, im just getting ready for my trip to England.&nbsp; I dont really know all of the people im going there with, but the 10 hour flight should allow me enough time to become friendly with my new posse. Oh ya, my mom needs to DIE. I just realized how much of a bitch my mom is. My friends, lol, use to tell me "" your mom is like fucken scruff Mc gruff"" LOL, at the time, I&nbsp;would&nbsp; cock slap them and tell them to never say that again. Now? I AGREE WITH THEM. my mom needs to get laid or eat some fruit or do anything that gets her to chill out. I mean i use to think it was impossible to walk around with a cock in ur ass(ron gallman LOL) but NOOOOOOOOOOO. my mom proved me wrong by achieving the impossible. she just needs to back the fuck off of me and learn how to deal with her issues without yelling at me. FUCKEN BITCH. so my trip to england should be fricken awesome. did u know that people in Britain call c smokes FAGS? i know its not that funny, but it still is wierd.&nbsp; but here is my checklist 1- get a haircut, I LOOK LIKE JESUS 2- go out with katy(hell yea pacifica) 3- buy some POUNDS, british currency 4- pack for the trip 5-charge my i-pod 6- make sure i have all of my extra shit for the trip like cell phone cords, i pod cords, and gameboy shit, and condoms, my hat, my music, i was JOSHIN about the condoms. 7- cock slap my mom 8- thats it 9- i  WAS  serious about cock slapping my mom. for now,  chauncey "
25316,3722603,"22,July,2004",2004-07-22,"   First off, im&nbsp;not actually a bitch, ILL KILL YOU if u call me one. JAYKAY,not really though. SECONDLY, so theres this girl that i sorta like. I dont know how im going to tell her. most people ive talked to about it say i should go ahead and tell her, but im hesitant to do so. i know she doesnt like me, but I feel obligated to tell her for some reason. I know FUNNY GIRL thinks i should not do it, but im going to. It will alleviate myself of any obligations ..............anyways, im just over analyzing&nbsp; LIKE A LITTLE GIRLY BITCH. THERE I ADMIT IT. ARE U HAPPY NOW??????. Lastly, i need to go back to europe NOW. its like a&nbsp; fricken drug man, I want more of it. Mainly the alcohol purchasing at the age of SIXTEEN. but the places were nice too, and so was this girl that i liked. w/e tho, its all behind and now i get to look forward to..... o wait, thats right, NOTHING! NOTHNG!= summer reading, school, life at home with my family, and the list keeps going and going and going. peace chauncey "
25317,3722603,"20,July,2004",2004-07-20,"   ive only been home for 4 days, and im already sick of being here.&nbsp; im probably just tired of being at home with my parents. in europe its basically like being on your own. maybe thats what i liked about it so much. that, plus the fact that i can buy my own alcohol.............but seriously. I CANT FUCKEN STAND BEING HOME WITH MY FAMILY. IM READY TO GO TO ENGLAND ALREADY. but i have 11 days until that happens. im just going to have to bare down, and deal with it. im fucken pathetic, im bitching about having a home to stay in, LOL, fuck it. chauncey "
25318,3722603,"17,July,2004",2004-07-17,"   so i just got back from my trip to europe with the SFYO. in short, it was just fucken crazy. everything you think i did, i probably did. we went to germany france austria and NETHERLANDS, home of amsterdam, home of the red light district which is a place where prostitution, and weed are legal( throughout all of the netherlands tho,). so you would see a prostitute in every window practically, just waiting to have a client.  justine patrick and myself went on a mission. we tried to take pictures with the prostitutes to bring back home. LOL, but see, we didnt want the hookers to feel us up like they do to all other customers, so patrick and I often told them we were gay so they would talk to us, and not grab our reproductive organs, which ONE BITCH DID. FUCKEN PROSTITUTE, anyways,while patrick and I were doing that, justine would take a picture of us, or the other way around. either way, we took a lot of pictures. but then, justine left her camera on the bus, so off with that bus went our shots, and our evidence of what we did. i bet most people wont believe what we did, but w/e. tour was just fucken great. i mean I was allowed to buy alcohol, everywhere except fucken cologne, germany. but man, i met some new friends, baileys, JD, smirnoff, and cola. Along with maryjane. TOUR WAS FUCKEN AWESOME on the other hand, i was in to this girl who i wont name, but most people know who she is. nothign really happened, but i found out how she feels about me, and now that i know that, it will be easier to talk to her. Fuck it, i shouldn't stress&nbsp;out over her. what happened, happened, and nothign can be changed so all i can do is&nbsp;wait until&nbsp;next year when i see her again.&nbsp; i just realized it is like 1 15, and i need to go to sleep. chauncey &nbsp; OH YA, I NEED TO SEE ( I ROBOT, SPIDERMAN 2, KING ARTHUR, ANCHORMAN, AND SOME FUCKEN GIANTS GAMES) fucken giants, i left and they were 3 and 1/2 up, now they are like 1/2 out. "" warriors about to sign derek fisher?"" about time, we got an actual player. now all we need to do is get one more player liek him, and we may have a decent team. cept we dont have a center besides foyle cuz dampier left. starting rotation derek fisher, jason richardson, troy murphy, mike dunleavy, and adonal foyle. i mean we do have some bench, clifford robinson, calbert cheaney, speedy claxton. if we add someone along ther skills of antanw jamison, we would be set. WHY DID WE TRADE HIM??????? our rotation could be somehting like fisher, richardson,jamison, dunleavy and dampier. YES we would ahve dampier cuz we would want to stay cuz we woudl have a good rotation. BUT THE FUCKEN WARRIORS ARE STUPID SO THEY ALWAYS FUCK SHIT UP FOR THEMSELVES. oh ya FUCK THE LAKERS. if only they couldve kept shaq, seriously. say goodbye to their dynasty. payotn and malone i THINK are finished, and all they have is kobe. they will always bebetter than the warriors, but they wontbe the same unless they get yao ming.

11408,3723398,"28,June,2004",2004-06-28,"    well, i'm in my first day of my MIMI training class at AspenTech ( urlLink http://www.aspentech.com/ ) in lovely Houston, TX.  i'll be here all week.  Houston seems nice, from the little i've seen of it - just about as humid as they come - and that from someone that's lived all their life in Atlanta & Nashville.  training so far ... lessee ... interesting, but old-hat stuff so far for me.  it's been nice getting the fleshed out ""official"" explanation/presentation, and it's afforded me the opportunity to find out some particulars and details i wouldn't have otherwise known, but thus far, there have been no major revelations.  BUT, i suppose that would be a credit to how well Mike trained me.  ;)  if all goes according to plan, i'll be able to meet up with a highschool buddy of mine for dinner sometime this week - for now, i'll hope for some of my fellow trainees being hungry after class - and if not... off on my own, i guess.  ;) "
11409,3723398,"23,June,2004",2004-06-23,"    so here's thoughts on my new job (and old job), now that i've had a bit over 1 week at it, full-time.  it's right nice to be able to step back and up a level, try to see and understand the big picture, and figure out the best course of action for said big picture.  i recently came from a ""fire-fighting"" job - that being, giving it all you've got just to keep up - life limited to living in I and III of the Covey Quadrants(tm), never making it to that sublime state of Quadrant II.  i learned quite a bit, about the operations and details of the business.  knowledge which has - and shall probably continue - to serve me well, but it never afforded me the chance to change things, and make them better.  conversely, my new job affords me the freedom (almost to the extent of being loosely defined) to dig into a process, question it, consider all the angles and alternatives, and (if need be) push to change it.  it seems the primary challenge in accomplishing this change is how to push who, when, and how hard.  going off my past experiences, step one is to sell the changee on why they need to do it - telling them they need to do it probably won't go too far towards the end goal.  darned thing is, it's just so much easier (especially for us nerd-types) to ""tell"" rather than ""sell"" - hopefully i can remember that.  perhaps more to come on that at a later date.  other new things - gmail!  it's different, but so far, i like it - i feel like waving a big ""I TOLD YOU SO"" flag to my former boss, assuming the gmail philosophy catches on like (f)atkins.  he was big on us filing every e-mail into an appropriate folder, and keeping the ""Inbox"" down to a bare minimum of messages.  i kept saying that i could keep all my messages in my inbox, and find any given message faster (remember - firefighting) just by searching appropriate keywords.  i'm not making the official change to gmail yet, but once it's out of beta - and particularly if they allow for POP3/other access - i'll probably take the plunge and go with it as my primary e-mail.  on a different gmail vein, everyone keeps yammering on about how horrible it is that they're screening your e-mail - privacy concerns, etc.  hmmm... sound like any other e-mail service or tool that auto-filters for spam out there?  how do they think it filters without screening your mail?  nevermind Yahoo! mail, which has been around for ages now, has been sending gmail invitations send to @yahoo.com addresses straight to the ""bulk mail"" folder - maybe i'm a conspiracist, but somehow i doubt that's a coincidence.  bottom line - if you're not running your own e-mail server, you need to accept that *legally*, someone is going to potentially be reading/screening/etc your mail.  be that your home ISP, your employer - you name it.  if it's that confidential, run your own mailserver and/or encrypt it.  ;) "
11410,3723398,"23,June,2004",2004-06-23,"    ... it's hard to say how this will turn out (i really do just use the namesake of the blog in speech/etc ALL THE TIME).  i've never been much of a maintainer of anything - i'm usually doing pretty good to get the oil changed in my truck.  i attribute that to being a high-level thinker.  ;)  oh well.  guess we'll see.  so, i guess i should define the starting point, here... * recently changed jobs to a new department within the same company.  still very new at it, but quite enjoying it thus far. * gettin' hitched soon, to a fabulous gal - got a lot to do, but am looking forward to it!  .... and ... that's it!  first post! "
11411,3723398,"01,July,2004",2004-07-01,"    so, I'm a bit over the half-way mark with the MIMI training in Houston.  It's been good so far - still nothing earth-shatteringly new, but it's been good to get information ""direct from the source"".  However, that's hardly on subject with this post.  ;)  having not much else to do, i went down to the hotel bar tonight, and seeing on of my favorite beers on tap (and feeling splurge-like), ordered up a draught of Guinness.  so there i was, minding my own business, sipping my draught, when the older fellow to my right asks, ""So - y'like your Guinness, eh?""  hell if it wasn't a native irishman sitting right next to me!  he, oddly enough, was working on a Budweiser (which i later learned, was due to the ""when in Rome..."" reasoning).  a lengthy discourse, covering a variety of topics, from beer to sports to politics to beer to travel to work to beer... ensued.  said discourse was later joined by the two Swedes from my MIMI class that happened in.  So There I Was (tm) - me, an Irishman and two Swedes - in the suburbs of Houston, Texas - discussing life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness, and various themes thereupon.  it reached truly sublime levels when Latin American bartender Sergio joined in.  did we all agree all the time?  of course not.  did i gain an understanding of how closely [european] football is followed?  Sure.  did i get the chance to explain baseball to two Swedes who knew next to nothing of it?  Sure.  did the Irishman and I debate social policy - with the utmost respect for the others' opinion?  Sure.  the above, to me, is the true joy in travelling - sure, seeing new and interesting sites and scenery is all well and good, but the real joy is the people you can meet along the way, if you take the time to talk to them and just find out a little about them.  i can only hope that i will soon approach that magical 3 weeks of vacation - which, as was discussed tonight, is quite sub-par in Europe (to the extent of actually being illegal, at least in Sweden) - such as to be able to travel more, and continue to meet yet more people from different places and see more things.  if there's one thing that i, as an admitted cheapskate, would continuously spend good money on, it's travel.  i can only hope that my future career - in both monetary terms and ""vactation"" terms - will afford me the opportunity to do so as often as possible.  daniel "

7996,3729846,"23,June,2004",2004-06-23,"   I have been busy these last couple of weeks making and editing and designing websites!  First of all, I am trying to put the finishing touches on my Beastie Boys website, that will take a couple of weeks, so i'll keep you updated.  I was also asked if I could create a mini-site for Drama at my college to help promote this play that we are doing called ""Work, Leisure, Life and Death"". I have created a template and finished most of the pages, but I have got to now put the information on the pages now which will take about 2 hours.  I also have another site in the pipeline promoting myself. I decided that I wanted to create a site for myself so that I can put up a couple of promo songs for my album that I am creating.  I have other websites that I would like to make in the future, so keep posted for further info.  Peace   "

I closed 'The Skoop' E-Zine after just 1 issue, the 1st issue was amazing, really good and interesting, but the reason I closed it down was because there was very little interest in it. I MAY start it up again, but we'll see what happens. If I do decide to bring it back, then i'll let y'all know on my website.  Tomorrow (18th August) i will HOPEFULLY have the 'Music' page on my website open, Ive produced 3 tracks and will get them up on the site for you to enjoy.  Im looking for people to join up to the message board, it's takin a little time for the word to spread, so the message board is a little bear right now, but im sure that will all change very soon. I will be adding LOADS of more topics to it, and im also gonna be starting competitions so look forward to that. - If you are interested in being a Moderator for the site then please get in contact with me.

31189,3732159,"23,June,2004",2004-06-23,"    Hey this is my first day here, and man does it feel kind a funny. Everything is all the sudden so new again.  I'm a 27 year college grade, who just moved back to my  home town. Yah not too much fun if you ask me, but I had to. My mother just became real sick, and well dad could care less, so I moved home to take care of her. I picked up my whole life, and moved just to help out.  So.... Now I have given up all my friends, business, and life. I am happy that I could, and that I was able to, but it is not all fun. Good thing I just found a good job, that could be a career which is nice!  Me I am a music nut!! I collect guitars, and love to play all styles of music. I read a lot, and love sneaking out for a beer or two at the local tavern. I moved from a small town, to the big city, and can not stop thinking of the MR Haggard's Song ""Big City."" I love that song... Well enough for now   "
31190,3732159,"17,August,2004",2004-08-17,"    Wow!! Landlords are calling me back. This is great!! I went and looked at a place today it is a good deal, but it is just not close to anything. I think I should hold off for a better place.  The list of books to read seems to be getting longer and longer. But, come fall I will have the time to nip that list in the butt. I love fall when I can crack a bottle of my favorite Cab or Merlot, and kick back with a great book. Looking forward this fall/ winter will be great!!! There is nothing better than coffee/wine, and a good book.     Nothing else to report for now..   "
31191,3732159,"16,August,2004",2004-08-16,"    Well another V8 splash smoothie down, and another flavor to try. Wow I like this stuff, and I don't  know why. Next flavor will be wild berry if I decide not to  get another orange. I have to say this is the best juice on the market.     It was a great weekend to go apartment shopping, but I did not find that perfect place yet. I did narrow my search down to a more focused area which will help.  I can make the deadline of Sept. 1 if these landlords will call me back.  The one apartment I did see was dirty, smelly, and  over priced. I know the right place is out there, but I just have to find it. The game plan for this coming weekend will be more apartment shopping.  It seems week in and week out I do the same thing every day. I wake up go to work, come home, cook, practice/ watch TV, and go to bed. I think I need to spice up my life a little, but, maybe this is good for right now. Till next time........      "" Opera is when a guy gets stabbed in the back and, instead of bleeding he sings.""         - Ed Gardner   "
31192,3732159,"13,August,2004",2004-08-13,"    "" Things turn out better by accident sometimes, but you can't organize an accident.""     -Jeff Beck    I saw this quote today, and though it was great.  So I have to look at apartments tomorrow. Of the 12ish landlords that I called 4 called me back, and 3 have canceled our appointments. Man this sucks!!! Why can't these people who spent money on advertising in the paper call me back? I just want to give these people money. At least the apartment that I wanted to see the most is still ago!     tomorrow apartment shopping, Irish fest, and I have to go to a party! I can taste the beer already.........   "
31193,3732159,"12,August,2004",2004-08-12,"    A couple of months ago I bought a  instrumen that I have wanted for many years, a Chapman Stick. Man these instruments are cool. It has to be the best sounding, and hardest instrument to play in the world!! I just can't get the hang of it. At first I was playing it every day for hours on end, and now I take it out at max twice a week. This instrument was invented by Emmett Chapman, and is considered one of the few American invented instruments. I don't think it can be more that 35-40 years old. The 'stick' is a 10 string guitar played upright, and tapped instead of strumed. You get sound out of it by just pushing the string down. The instrument is like piano played upright. So tonight I was playing it, and finally made some progress forward. I think I am going to try to play at least 4 times a week, and cut back my guitar playing.    I have a new simple pleasure in life... V8 splash smoothies. Man I love this stuff! It seems I have a small glass of this every night before I go to bed. I am not sure which one I like the most, but the orange cream is pretty darn good.    Well that's all for now... Till next time   "
31194,3732159,"11,August,2004",2004-08-11,"    Finally I had a great day at work! So far this week it has been nothing but problem after problem. I guess it was a good thing because, I know how the system works a little better, but it still sucks to have a no good very bad week.       Other than a good day at work nothing else is new. Same old stuff different day. I played guitar for a while, and now on the computer. I think it is about time I snuck out, and started playing some of the local open mic night again. I used to love playing at open mic's, but haven't for a long time. Sounds like a plan!!! Oh, I also started mentally packing up all my stuff for my move into the city. I truly believe that mental packing is a very important step to the real packing. First you need to get a plan of what will go where, what should go into each box, and how many boxes you think you will need. The mental packing takes triple the amount of time than real packing, but it really does help. The good news is I never unpacked when I got here, so half my stuff is already packed! Do know that there are some boxes that I have moved 3-4 times, and have never unpacked them? Maybe I should throw them out, or sell them on eBay. Who knows...... I do know this I need a bigger place!   "
31195,3732159,"10,August,2004",2004-08-10,"    So what is with all the people who refuse to make coffee at work? I am not a heavy coffee drinker, but I tend to make at least one pot of coffee per cup I pour. To top it off every time I go to get a cup of coffee, there is never any left. Man, these little things just make me mad, but I guess I can rant and rave all I want, and nothing will change. So far that is the most pressing issue of the week no coffee. As one can tell I live a very interesting life. So I have never been a big TV watcher, but this summer I have become hooked (and I must stress hooked) on the show,  Big Brother.  I am hooked!!! I was just stoked to see that jerk Jace put up for eviction. Ha ha ha......... I never thought that I would be a TV watcher, and now I am hooked on a couple shows. Some people may tell me it is a bad things, and others will not admit that they watch TV, but hey I don't care. I am really looking forward to Irish fest this weekend!! Hopefully there will be a whole lot of dancing, singing, and SODA bread. Man... Things like this make me happy to be back in the big city. Well, that's my story and I am sticking to it. As Jimmy said.........."" If you want to see the world you've got to kiss the girl.....""   "
31196,3732159,"09,August,2004",2004-08-09,"    Well it has been a while since I did this, and I thought I would start up again. Lots of things going on. The band and I played our first show in a long time, and it went real well, but I can not figure out if I should continue to play with them. Ever since I moved it has been a hell of a lot harder to keep things going on my end. I have a real job, and am no longer a 'working musician.' The band has been going great, but I can not keep up all the traveling that I have been doing. O well what can ya do. I have another weekend comming up of nothing but apartment shopping. I am so close to paying someone to find an apartment for me. I hate the tours, and all the sales pitches. I just hope I find a place this weekend. O.k. here's my big question from the weekend of driving around the country.... Are billboards more effective now that people have cell phones? Are people more likely to pick up there phone, and dial that number since every thing is right there? I don't know.........   "
13424,3732960,"27,June,2004",2004-06-27,"   how odd are we all? keeping an online journal so anybody who's anybody can find out what we're doing on a day to day basis. id say we all never got enough attention when we were younger....  im bored... i could really go for a smoke, but its raining outside and that sucks.  lets see... whatd i do friday... i met up with kels at 2:25ish to go to work the phish show at 3 at alpine. so we saw kreger at the show and did nothing (and got paid for it) for like 2 1/2 hours. then my team leader forgot about me, so i didnt get a break till 10ish. i bummed a cig from some chick and it was a lite, so that lasted me all night until after everything was done and we were goin home at like 120 in the morning when i went up to some other girl and asked to bum one of her camels which she did give me. so then i went home and my sis was home from college and we sat in our driveway and smoked a cig and she told me how horrible her date went. then we went inside and talked about Bonaroo (cuz she went) over a beer. then i went to bed cuz i had to work at steins the next day.  which brings us to saturday. i went to work from 1230 - 9pm and during the day me jamie and katie decided we'd hang out. so after work i came home and took a shower and called them up and they came and picked me up. so we drove around and smoked 2 bowls of katies dank ass nugs, and then went to dennys. in the car, the 3 of us were geekin. so when we got into dennys, jamie went to the bathroom and when the waitress came, me and katie geeked for like 10 minutes (which was bad) cuz it was so obvious we were fuckin ripped. then one of our bosses from steins walked in with his girlfriend around 11 and we were like oh fuck. but nothin bad happened. later when i started getting tired and we were all done eating, katie went to the bathroom and jamie was like ""youre tired arent you"" and i said yea but i still wanted to hang out with em cuz i didnt wanna seem like i was having a bad time or anything, which i wasnt, but jamie was like ""dude its no big deal, cuz i know you have to work at 9 tomorrow"". my ripped ass was like ok. so they dropped me off at home and me and my dog sat around till like 130 watching shitty TV.   which gets us to sunday. i went to work at 9 (till 1) and it went by surprisingly fast. when i first got there jamie told me about how her and katie accidentally ran somebody off the road cuz jamie was fuckin around in her car and not looking and she ended up in the wrong lane, which made me laugh. then i went and worked till i got to leave.   cool thing happened this weekend. i found out jamie likes horror movies and reading about true murderers and stuff. which was really cool, cuz i like that shit too... i love scaring the shit outta myself for some odd reason. so anyway, jamie let me borrow a couple of books she has about scary people that were murderers. then i went home and took a shower and me and my brother went to best buy, circuit city, and soundwaves. i bought dead or alive 2:hardcore cuz its one of the only videogames i actually like, Gia, and donnie darko. and that brings me to this very moment... queens of the stoneage ""No one knows"" is playing. i like that song.   "
13425,3732960,"24,June,2004",2004-06-24,"   PRETTY SHITT!   lets see, everyday i have to wake up at 9 to get ready and go to summer school. then every couple of days i get to come home, take a 2 hour nap, then go work at Steins. and i have to devote a large handful of weekends to working at alpine valley (music theater) and thats not really fun, cuz you get there at like 11 in the morning and dont get to go home till 1 or 2 AM the next day! last year was pretty fun cuz we got to do whatever we wanted there, but now they changed everything and you dont get to walk around everywhere, you have to stay in one parking lot, and you get switched around, so sometimes you're working in the show but the only plus to that is you KINDA get to see the show, but the shitty thing is youre checking tickets and standing ALL NIGHT LONG.   so its not even worth trying to go out and party or anything cuz if its during the week i have to get up at 9 and go to school and then go work at steins, and if its a weekend im working at either steins or alpine!   now i know what youre all thinking.. yea but youll have money... WRONG! i still owe my dad like $450-$500 for car insurance and a large chunck of the rest goes into savings... FUCK SCHOOL, FUCK WORK, FUCK DEBT....this summer sucks   "
13426,3732960,"23,June,2004",2004-06-23,"   the life i used to have. my freshman year, i had two or three really close friends who would come over EVERY weekend and drink and smoke at my house. seriously for 6 months straight all we did was go in my basement and take shots and then around midnight we'd head outside and do stupid shit all night. we'd sit in cait's car and smoke or take walks down the road and smoke out of our homemade bongs and shit (occasionally we had a pipe) but thats besides the point. now everyone is stupid and doesnt know how to have fun. one of the close friends i had cant smoke or drink anymore because his girlfriend wont allow it and the others all graduated and have work everyday and shit... and im only a senior.  I started talking to my one of my friends again today. Monica AKA monular. we went to school together freshman year, then she moved and now she goes to a different school. but hey at least we started talking again.  this year i had to ""buckle down"" and worry about grades and stuff cuz i want to go to college and be able to support myself when im older, but i just missed constantly being high and drunk. ive only smoked three times in the past 2 weeks... if this were a couple years ago... i couldnt have gone 2 weeks without smokin at least once a day, and im not talking one bowl, im talking fucking RIPPED off my ass. and one of the best nights of my life was when i was on x.... everything was so fucking awesome, i felt sooo good and everyone was having a good time. i miss shroomin too...  you know youre good and fucked up when your living room starts getting smaller and smaller. heh.   last year was kinda like that. but i always make friends with older people and then they go and graduate. i had a good share of my drunk and high times, and now my BEST friend in the world is moving away and getting married aug. 21st and the rest of them are all going to school and working everyday. this sucks...im going to bed.   "
13427,3732960,"23,June,2004",2004-06-23,"   im bored.  i hate all that lord of the rings shit. granted, ive never seen or read any of the stories... its all just so ""dungeons and dragons""-ish and all that shit is stupid (in my opinion). Im not a big fan of the whole harry potter craze either, same with all that Pokemon shit... never liked it at all. I played it once, and had absolutely no idea what anything meant, so i stopped. Fun things are easy to follow. No complicated story lines or any of that shit. Unless youre talkin about the movie memento... now there was a good complicated movie. ive seen it like 5 times now. im listening to ""Control"" by Puddle of Mudd.... just thought id share. im headin out for a smoke.... be right back (11:22 pm)ok im back (11:26 pm) well that was fun. i've got ""Broken"" by seether playing now.. good song. My friend Becky is hilarious. she always tells me that the first time she heard me talking was when i was talking to this other girl about drugs and she thought to herself ""i hope that kid never talks to me"" now we're best friends. I think we get along so well cuz we're both really sarcastic.. about EVERYTHING!                            *AIM CONVERSATION* me: i hope your watching TV er something, cuz i dont have one with cable in here, so if it says somethinglike hey get in yer basement tornado to the fullest... i wouldnt know becky: lol becky: tornado to the fullest becky: is that like the BET weather channel  BET is black entertainment television for all you out there who don't know that. *wink*   i hate living in a small town... and i hate being in high school (only one year left thank god) you're so sheltered from everything, and i hate being naive.

13428,3732960,"23,June,2004",2004-06-23,   urlLink    Me at my friend Terri's house&nbsp; urlLink   
13429,3732960,"23,June,2004",2004-06-23,"   I planned on starting this thing on monday, but that never happened, so ill go back to the beginning of the week.  fucking summer school started on monday... god damn shit fuck bitch cunt.... ok ive vented. kathy (my better half) left for virginia beach on monday too.. she'll be gone for a week. so yea i woke up and took a shower and got ready for school and i realized i was kinda early. so i called my friend katie up and asked if she wanted to smoke. eventhough she'd just waked n baked she said sure. so i picked her up and we smoked. then i had to go to summer school, so i drove out to bumfuck mukwonago and sat in school for 2 hours... the whole time fidgeting cuz i needed a smoke. after school came home and slept, cuz schwag does that to ya. (Dont get the impression that me and my friends are dirty schwizzo smokers, she got it for free, so what the hell, eh?) then i woke up and called my friend erin and we had to go to the library for a book for my summer school class... then we went to her place and watched the end of Futurama and Family Guy, then i decided to go home  tuesday was shitty. woke up, went to school, came home, watched tv for awhile, then worked 4-9, came home, watched 50 first dates, and went to bed.  that brings us to today. (listenin to the beatles, ""Love Me Do"" is on) so i had to get up early and get my work permit for alpine valley, and i forgot how long that shit takes and i cant be late for summer school, so i left at 9:15 to get that shit done and got to the place at 9:25ish and realized that all she had to do was sign and photocopy some stuff... so i was going to be hella early to school. i decided to entertain myself and drive out of my way on a cigarette roady.. too bad that only took up 5 minutes of my time. i got to school around 9:40 and sat and (""From me to you"" is on now)read from this book SMACK by Melvin Burgess. Its about running away from home and getting addicted to what else... heroin. sounds good, ill keep you all posted. then i came home and watched tv for awhile then listened to music.   "
13430,3732960,"07,July,2004",2004-07-07,"   yea so my dad's been being a penis as usual. he always walks around like we're all ruining his life, when in actuality none of us are doing anything wrong. the other day he accused my mom of hiding his bills.... explain this to me somebody!! why would my mom hide HIS BILLS, that she has NOTHING to do with!? (which is exactly what she said to him). Then i hear he's bitching because me and my brothers dont do his yardwork anymore. my ma says he said something along the lines of ""Im not doin all this yard work myself, those boys dont do anything around here"" or something to that effect... ok, me and my brothers are no longer 10, 12, and 16 years old anymore! we're 17, 19, and 23! we all have more important things to do LIKE OUR JOBS than his yard work. I have summer school every day, and then most of those days, i have to go to work a couple hours later! and then on the weekends im either working one job or the other, or both! i dont have time to do that shit and he knows it. seriously, he just likes bitching and acting like no one is useful except himself, and its really fucking annoying. Im sick of him telling me how im useless and getting a ""free ride"" because when i was younger, we busted ass helping him with stuff. Sorry dad, that we have lives now.   "
13431,3732960,"03,July,2004",2004-07-03,"   Yesterday me and kathy went to lunch after summer school... yes i know, subway is so romantic. Then i went home and slept and she went shopping and to get Sally fixed. When i woke up and got ready, we headed to summerfest. we'd panned on seeing switchfoot. then we decided to keep our options open, cuz we'd both heard ""meant to live"" 100000 times on the radio, so we were debating between switchfoot, dashboard confessional, and trapt. What did we end up seeing??? NONE OF THEM! We just walked around the whole time. I saw some cool people. Brie, Heikinnen, Menghe, Christina and Sidlarz, Britney, Dan, Chiello, Hannah, and my friend jessica, so that was cool. But the plan was to meet up with some of my other friends and get shit-faced. turns out they decided to leave their cell phone at home, and i didnt find 'em all night. Then we got to the car to go home and got stuck in the parking structure for about 45 minutes, and there were stupid people who kept laying on the horn cuz there was a huge ass traffic jam and it just started to give me a headache, but when their stupidness died down, i was fine. Then me and kathy decided to say fuck you to the huge traffic jam getting on the freeway, and we went the other way.... only problem: we didnt know how to get home that way. Yea Turns out, kathy's a spectacular driver and navigated her way from there to the freeway and we got home around 1:15ish. I made myself a drink (which i'd wanted to do all night) and then kathy decided she should go, cuz she had to work this morning at 9... poor kathy. **Dumbest License Plate: ""GV THNX 2""  Thursday I went to school, came home and slept, went to work, then came home and did nothing.  Wednesday I honestly can't even remember what I did.  Tuesday I went to school, then went to kathy's right after and she made me lunch. Then we were bored and decided to go to Soundwaves, then to the mall... i made 4$ (kathy made 6$) take a survey at the mall... it was pretty worth it, cept the lady asking the questions was a fucking crackhead.

11397,3735538,"24,June,2004",2004-06-24,"   lifes interesting now. certain events really scare me and make me worry about whatll happen next. my mom wont leave me at home by myself anymore cuz i had cammie over for about 4 hours on tuesday. at least i think it was tuesday...we were both sick, and her mom didnt know where she was.  HOURS LATER...  went to cammies earlier. had fun with her and preston, then annalise came, and we still had fun. cammie wished that by the end of the summer we would be able to tell each other that we loved each other. i dunno if ill be able to, cuz of the tally incident. but w/e, ill figure something out. listeing to soybomb rite now, sad cuz they broke up. in 24 hours ill b somewhere in idaho, sleeping in a stranger's house. well, at least i think ill be asleep. wouldnt count on it though. tomorrow'll be my last entry for at least a week. jeez its a 2 day drive to canada. hopefully itll b fun. ill miss cammie sooo much, it wont b fun. o well, canucks r cool. most of them anyways. mmm the LIVESTRONG braclet cammie's dad gave me smells good cuz cammie put perfume stuff on it. cant stop sniffing it lol. grrr im gonna miss her lots. as soon as i get bak, im gonna b moving. well, pretty soon afterwards anyways. i dunno what ill do if i cant see cammie every day. o god i dont wanna think about that. ill fall apart. i dont think she knows it but shes such a big part of me... ill cry at least once, im sure. "
11398,3735538,"23,June,2004",2004-06-23,"   The last few days have been pretty hectic. Cammie and me hit lots of rocks - big rocks - emotionally and now we're better. it was really tough cuz i think she loves me or something and doesnt want to say it, cuz she thinks i might not feel the same way. i cant say i blame her cuz from what happened with tally, its hard to say i love someone new. schools out finally, and i didnt beat bob up. goin to canada for a fuckin week on saturday, and its a two day drive just to get there. Staying in banff, alberta. goin with mckinley and stuff. i hope i dont get too bored. sounds boring. on the way bak i get to buy firecrackers and stuff from the indian reservation though, so that'll b fun. tubs of it. wow mckinley just reminded me he has one of my magic decks, so i hope my good cards are in there. ive been looking everywhere for them! im such a nerd, o well. its a fun game, really. i dont see why ppl have to look down upon ppl from doing stuff they like. w/e, doesnt matter to me. hopefully IHS wont hate too much. o god IHS is gonna b sooo lame. im not looking too forward to it. ill miss all the friends i guess i made at MMS, but i wanna start over. screwd up too many times. "
11399,3735538,"13,July,2004",2004-07-13,"   ha yesterday was a fucked up trip. first i found out that cammie came home sick from camp, cuz she had another dizzy spell and stuff, then i hung out with her till like 10 in the evening, from about 2 in the afternoon. afterwards i got home and was supposed to call her, but she wasn't home yet, cuz i think either her mom lied to me and said she wasn't home, or her dad had pulled over to yell at her cuz she just ran out earlier that day. whatever is was, i had told cammie earlier that i would be at her house around 1 or something. but anyways, after i got home i called my mom, got in the shower, then went to shelby's. had  a  drink. just one. once that was done molly was totally wasted and we hadta escort her back to her room. meanwhile as all this is goin on, her mom is asleep on the couch. shes still there and its 2:45 am. so anyways, i talked to molly about her emotional issues for like...2 hours. i think i helped her, but im not sure. rite now shes asleep, hopefully forgetting all thats happened since she started drinking, specifically chase. she really loves that kid, and he doesnt acknowledge it at all. i feel sorry for her, because she has apologized multiple times for cheating on him while they were goin out, and he still doesnt talk to her, much less be nice to her. she said he called her ""the biggest ho in the world"" and some other nasty names. it almost seems like the tally incident with just reversed sexes. just what i needed. o well, it feels good to talk. and help her. she says shell miss me, and i think she will. unless all this has been just a drunk episode. thatd b kinda funny if it was, ya? pretty chaotic. im done for now. peace.

11400,3735538,"11,July,2004",2004-07-11,"   well, now cammies gone. ill miss her so much. i just finished writing her email, and now i hafta wait an hour before i go down to mollys and drink my boxers off maybe, lol. i kinda doubt ill actually drink, but maybe i will. also just watched the grand finale to BgC2 of RvB, it was funny. codename dirtbag! omally made off with lopez through the teleporter and now all hell's broke loose. i wonder what happens next. no more episodes for a few months. hmm...i really dont know what to write. i spent all day today with cammie, and it was fun. we had a water fight, among other things. ie jumped on the tramp, ate stuff, listened to music, chilled, etc. it was fun. ill really miss her. i dont know what to write so ill either edit this later or who knows. peace.

11401,3735538,"10,July,2004",2004-07-10,"   cammie leaves tomorrow, and i move on tuesday. marches are still here, dunno when they leave. they kinda get annoying. so later im goin down to cammies again, actualy make that rite after im done typing this. i got a plan to do while cammies at camp, im gonna sneak out one night and help them raid stuff, then cammie an me will b together for a while at least. on friday im goin to the walkers cabin near Olympia so i wont get to see cammie before i go. ill hafta wait till monday! o well, at least ill get to see her again. i think im gonna stop taking my medicine cuz it makes it so i cant show any emotion. im always sure that i love cammie when i havent taken my medicine, but when i do take it im never sure. its really starting to bug me. but hopefully itll all be batter once i stop taking it. i really want to love her as much as she loves me. she sewed C-A-M-M-I-E into my sleeve end on my blacklabel jacket. and she stitched up the neck place thing. how sweet lol. ill be happy to see her as soon as she gets back. i cant say that i will miss her, but im sure i will. ive seen her every day this week. i gave her a stuffed koala bear thing which i thought was pretty ugly, but she acted like she liked it so, ya. at least she didnt make me feel stupid. we had a water fight today and afterwards she was worried that after this week i wouldnt love her anymore cuz we had been apart for a week. i reassured her that id still love her just as much, if not more, cuz i hadnt seen her for a week. i sure hope i still love her. really, ill feel so bad if i dont. i really dont wanna lose her. it was ruin me and her. im gonna go now, ill write more tomorrow. peace.

8804,3736053,"25,June,2004",2004-06-25,"   Here i am. Finished my two days this week, sitting and drinking tea while it's about 35 degrees celsius outside. I'm sweating like a pig. This heat is amazing! The last time i experienced something similar was last year when i was studying spanish in Sevilla. In the end of may we had temperatures closer to 40 degrees, still a different heat though.  This weekend i want to do a lot of stuff...  I'm planning to work a little bit on that photojob i got, there are some people that want some 30 creative photos. So i'm brainstorming about situations or places where i can shoot thoose...  And i want to go out and party some tonight, for the first time in two weeks since i was working all weekend long last week. However, this weekend is short, on monday i work again, and it will be monday til friday...  Still not sure...  I wan't to do something else during the days, something more creative, but how does that and money go together, well... offer me a job within something creative and we have a solution.  Now: Siesta and food  Hasta luego.  "
8805,3736053,"25,June,2004",2004-06-25,"   I'm tired, it's my sixth day working, not in a row but scattered on two seperate weeks. I was looking forward to finish my studies at Centro de Lenguas Modernas and i did, even with a good result. In the end it felt like something i just wanted to get overwith, to end something and begin something else, the time after the studies, find a job, intent to settle myself in this city, and just become sure that i don't have to leave when my studies finished...  And my plan worked, but still i miss a lot of things in my life, i still don't have the job of my dreams, but i'm still able to survive with the job i got right now. Another thing is that i would like to move to an apartment of my own. Something more personal, but i guess i'll have to wait.  I guess things come when i less expect them.   And i believe in surprises.  "
8806,3736053,"28,June,2004",2004-06-28,"   Monday, job is done, and i'm dying of starvation and this heat. I was on my way to get some food but i though of writing down some words before i keep going on with my normal life.  This weekend was great, exactly what a weekend should be...  It began with Granadas gaypride, small in it's size, but with a lot of fun people. Later that afternoon i was DJ:ing, actually for the first time in almost 2 years, and hell, i realized i was missing that soo much!! Played some tunes for about an hour and i felt like a new person. A mixture between jazz, electronica and some beats.  The day was crazy though, a heat together with drinking for many many hours... and a lot of photos made. Went to bed quite early to get up in the morning, not that early, but to go to the beach... and hell... yesterday was an even hotter day, laying on the beach, under the sun, jumping into the mideterranian sea many times, drinking about 5 litres of water... and driving back between the mountainous passages of Sierra Nevada.  Today my body hurts a little bit, burned by the sun, but not so tired, i guess i'm begining to get used to all this working. Waking up early, the hours passes by really fast, and then Silvia, my friend takes over...  In my mind there are many things, thoughts of jobs, future plans... however... my life is liven day by day, i don't think about tomorrow and neither yesterday.  This is me, stereosampling.  "
8807,3736053,"05,July,2004",2004-07-05,"   So this is what has happened. This saturday the owner of our falt came by with some people... saying: - we're goig to sell the flat. And since our contract officially ends now in July, even if we can unofficially live there for another 2 months until September 1:st, the situation is a little bit tricky. That is... it's difficult to find a flat in September, and even though i love Granada as the place i fell in love with about 2 years ago i feel that a change of atmosphere would be in it's place. Furthermore... finding a job here is difficult so, after throwing around some 100 CV's and being very very optimistic and happy towards the poeple iv'e met the only thing i have is the job in the hostel. Yes, of course, it keeps me alive but i'm looking for something more... with possibilities towards the future. I know you can't build a city in one day and neither a life in a different city, but with the background and experience i have in the world of creativity there should be more to find... or at least more response from... whoever who have seen my CV and my CD with all the stuff i've done the last years.   So the solution was... find another place in Granada and keep being optimistic about an unknown future... or move to another place.   And this whole thing about Barcelona isn't actually something new, it's a 3 months old thing that have been putting questionmarks in my head.  So... this thing with suddently having to leave the apartment, and choosing to do that at this point and not within 3 months... i feel it like a push forward. Like, take a chance, go there and see what the big city has to offer. And i do believe a lot in Barcelona, not only that it's bigger but also all the things this cosmopolitan city have to offer.   So... we've put the date to August 2nd... but it might change depending on the circumstances.   Me and my friend Roman will rent a car and then drive up along the coast with all our stuff, and as we see it, an old life will end and a new one will begin.  An adventure of some kind, something i'm looking forward to.  Before the weekend i was thinking of leaveing this job this week, but life might change very suddently, so, i'll stay until i go. I will miss the feeling of meeting new people every day, show them my favourite places on the map of Granada. But i have to get something done in my life, at least something inside me pushes me forward. And somehow i see myself over there, along the northeast coast of Spain, in Barcelona. Images created in my head, but with theese dreams and my optimism i will reach that.  Stereosampling.  "

11913,3737807,"05,July,2004",2004-07-05,"   Donâ€™t worry; this will be the last timeâ€¦  Sending this was never easy for me. Particularly now, knowing that you may not even care what this letter is all about. Knowing that, at this point in time, you may not give a damn regarding what I feel. And it kills me to think that youâ€™re much happier without meâ€¦but Iâ€™ll send it anyway, itâ€™s hard to keep things hanging on, leaving stones unturned, as well as I donâ€™t want regretting â€œwhat ifsâ€ afterwards.  There are so many things that happened without specific reasonsâ€¦ and I presume youâ€™ll be the biggest question unanswered in my life.  As I begin writing this, I look back late last year, when I experienced happiness I never knew would be possible. It was before my second semester, everything was laid back - nothing really to look forward to, until I heard the news about our reunionâ€¦                 I was ecstatic knowing that Iâ€™ll be seeing my long lost friends...     and believe it or notâ€¦specially you.  Before that day, I was so excited to text you after hearing that youâ€™ve been sending messages to ma.fe, even though she told me that youâ€™ve been asking her aboutâ€¦ you know, courting herâ€¦, but what the heck! Reuniting with you even as a former classmate would be fine.  And so there it was, the big day arrived. To tell you honestly, I was so nervous at that timeâ€¦why? I didnâ€™t know either. Iâ€™ve been quiet the whole day, not just because I donâ€™t fell well, but because all these years I never thought the feeling would be the same. However, aware that you like ma.fe, I ignored itâ€¦I just wanted to go back to where I amâ€¦maybe weâ€™re really not meant to be.  But fate took its turn. Everything happened so fast. Surprisingly, Iâ€™ve found myself deeply falling in love with you. Iâ€™ve never been happier. Iâ€™m used to having you beside meâ€¦ There were times that I have so many weights to carry onâ€¦at school, at home, but I donâ€™t worry much, because I know that youâ€™ll always be there. Walang Iwananâ€¦ We always worked things out and facing each problem seemed a lot easier having you around. Oftentimes, iniisip ko, mawala na silang lahat wag ka lang. Even in my wildest dream I never picture losing you, I thought what weâ€™ve been through will be reason enough for us to stay strong and hold onâ€¦ but I guess I was wrong.   Everything seems so perfect, or so I thought it wasâ€¦ I already set my mind and more than willing to spend my lifetime with you...no questions askâ€¦you know that. We used to dream. And I know that visualizing my future with somebody else will not be as ideal if it wonâ€™t be you.  Until that dayâ€¦ I didnâ€™t really see it coming.  I wasnâ€™t, or rather, never prepared for that.  I assumed you loved me that much.  All throughout our relationship, I never thought another girl would ruin everything. Youâ€™ve been telling me before that itâ€™s impossible.  Not to you. Not to us. And not now. I even thought that if we were going to part ways, Iâ€™d be the one to blameâ€¦ You know what?, Iâ€™ve never been so insecure my entire life, after hearing all the things youâ€™ve said. Youâ€™ve turned into someone else just like that.  I still remember that Sunday, our last break-up, you decided to end this because                             sabi mo,â€ nahihirapan ka naâ€ ,I canâ€™t help thinking, bakit ganon? bakit laging ikaw? di mo ba naisip na mas nasasaktan ako?â€¦ Itâ€™s hard to accept that kind of reality..  The pain has its own way of wounding your whole being. Itâ€™s hard to regain yourself â€¦not after taking away something youâ€™ve always asked for. Overreacting as you may think I amâ€¦but who cares?â€¦itâ€™s the truth.  It was never easy for me. I was so helpless.  Agony would be an understatementâ€¦it was hell.  I wasnâ€™t ready to face the truth and give up.  Your memories keep haunting me and moving on seems impossible. For days I keep on cryingâ€¦I keep thinking what went wrong...        Iâ€™m really devastated. I was so scared.  I canâ€™t bear loosing you. I wanted to talk to you personally to patch up things, even as your friend, but you rejected me every time I triedâ€¦ Still, I insist.  Until that incident in SM Manilaâ€¦ It strike me hard, big time! It was an eye-opener for me.             I have to save something for myselfâ€¦ at least my self-respect. And that was more than enough reason to let you goâ€¦sorry it took that longâ€¦ I guess itâ€™s really over thenâ€¦   Now I know that some good things never lastâ€¦  I decided to tell you all this because I donâ€™t want to remain issues unsettled between us. Hating you will not help me forget.           Iâ€™ve realized it. Sure Iâ€™ll miss you. Iâ€™m missing you now, what more tomorrow and for the days to come, but it was so pathetic holding on to something that is not yours anymore. I was stupid to think that youâ€™ll be coming back. But I guess itâ€™s also my fault. I never stop on hoping that youâ€™ll be back to your senses, but maybe it has to be this wayâ€¦  I just hope that sooner or later Iâ€™ll understand it.  Telling you this has been hard for me. And I guess I should prepare myself for more. It would hurt me seeing you with someone else, but I donâ€™t want to be selfish. Iâ€™ll let you grow and find what will really makes you happy. I may or may not regret giving you this letter but I know I would not regret telling you this...                           I loved youâ€¦I loved you even before. More than I expected, more than you knowâ€¦I still consider you one of the best things that ever happened to me. Sana hindi na lang nagbagoâ€¦                          if only I could turn back time...                                                                   Thank you for everything. Thank you for the good memories that are worth remembering.  Iâ€™m sorry for making such a big deal out of this.  I never imagined Iâ€™ll be seeing you again after four long yearsâ€¦whatever the reason, Iâ€™m glad it did.                                  I hope someday weâ€™ll meet again...                                    As they say,only time will tellâ€¦ "

Reuniting with you even as a former classmate would be fine.  And so there it was, the big day arrived. To tell you honestly, I was so nervous at that timeâ€¦why? I didnâ€™t know either. Iâ€™ve been quiet the whole day, not just because I donâ€™t fell well, but because all these years I never thought the feeling would be the same. However, aware that you like ma.fe, I ignored itâ€¦I just wanted to go back to where I amâ€¦maybe weâ€™re really not meant to be.  But fate took its turn. Everything happened so fast. Surprisingly, Iâ€™ve found myself deeply falling in love with you. Iâ€™ve never been happier. Iâ€™m used to having you beside meâ€¦ There were times that I have so many weights to carry onâ€¦at school, at home, but I donâ€™t worry much, because I know that youâ€™ll always be there. Walang Iwananâ€¦ We always worked things out and facing each problem seemed a lot easier having you around. Oftentimes, iniisip ko, mawala na silang lahat wag ka lang. Even in my wildest dream I never picture losing you, I thought what weâ€™ve been through will be reason enough for us to stay strong and hold onâ€¦ but I guess I was wrong.   Everything seems so perfect, or so I thought it wasâ€¦ I already set my mind and more than willing to spend my lifetime with youâ€¦no questions askâ€¦you know that.                                   We used to dream.                                                      And I know that visualizing my future with somebody else will not be as ideal if it wonâ€™t be you.  Until that dayâ€¦ I didnâ€™t really see it coming.  I wasnâ€™t, or rather, never prepared for that.  I assumed you loved me that much.  All throughout our relationship, I never thought another girl would ruin everything. Youâ€™ve been telling me before that itâ€™s impossible.  Not to you. Not to us. And not now. I even thought that if we were going to part ways, Iâ€™d be the one to blameâ€¦ You know what?, Iâ€™ve never been so insecure my entire life, after hearing all the things youâ€™ve said. Youâ€™ve turned into someone else just like that.  I still remember that Sunday, our last break-up, you decided to end this because sabi mo,â€ nahihirapan ka naâ€ ,I canâ€™t help thinking, bakit ganon? bakit laging ikaw? di mo ba naisip na mas nasasaktan ako?â€¦ Itâ€™s hard to accept that kind of reality..  The pain has its own way of wounding your whole being. Itâ€™s hard to regain yourself â€¦not after taking away something youâ€™ve always asked for. Overreacting as you may think I amâ€¦but who cares?â€¦itâ€™s the truth.  It was never easy for me. I was so helpless.  Agony would be an understatementâ€¦it was hell.  I wasnâ€™t ready to face the truth and give up.  Your memories keep haunting me and moving on seems impossible. For days I keep on cryingâ€¦I keep thinking what went wrong...          Iâ€™m really devastated. I was so scared.  I canâ€™t bear loosing you. I wanted to talk to you personally to patch up things, even as your friend, but you rejected me every time I triedâ€¦ Still, I insist.  Until that incident in SM Manilaâ€¦ It strike me hard, big time! It was an eye-opener for me.              I have to save something for myselfâ€¦ at least my self-respect.        And that was more than enough reason to let you goâ€¦                sorry it took that longâ€¦ I guess itâ€™s really over thenâ€¦   Now I know that some good things never lastâ€¦  I decided to tell you all this because I donâ€™t want to remain issues unsettled between us. Hating you will not help me forget.             Iâ€™ve realized it. Sure Iâ€™ll miss you. Iâ€™m missing you now, what more tomorrow and for the days to come, but it was so pathetic holding on to something that is not yours anymore. I was stupid to think that youâ€™ll be coming back. But I guess itâ€™s also my fault. I never stop on hoping that youâ€™ll be back to your senses, but maybe it has to be this wayâ€¦  I just hope that sooner or later Iâ€™ll understand it.  Telling you this has been hard for me. And I guess I should prepare myself for more. It would hurt me seeing you with someone else, but I donâ€™t want to be selfish. Iâ€™ll let you grow and find what will really makes you happy. I may or may not regret giving you this letter but I know I would not regret telling you this...I loved youâ€¦I loved you even before.  More than I expected, more than you knowâ€¦                I still consider you one of the best things that ever happened to me. Sana hindi na lang nagbagoâ€¦if only I could turn back time...          Thank you for everything. Thank you for the good memories that are worth remembering. Sorry for making such a big deal out of this.      I never imagined Iâ€™ll be seeing you again after four long yearsâ€¦whatever the reason,                                                 Iâ€™m glad it did.                                                      I hope someday weâ€™ll meet again...                                     As they say, only time will tellâ€¦                                                      >Catherine "

11683,3738552,"24,June,2004",2004-06-24,"    So I have found yet another way to spread my mental problems around the net like so much Skippy . The ego boost almost knocked me out of this chair . But my problem lies in the fact that I have no idea what this first of many posts should be about . I think something about monkeys would be good . However I cannot think of a single thing to say about those fuzzy little poo throwing, flea eating, angelic bundles of monkey goodness. Well of course with the exception of the horrible monkey incident that befell me when I was but a young impish boy *cringe* . So maybe something deep and thought provoking , but no not enough sleep for deep thought , the synapses aren't firing today . So after much personal soul searching and meditation I have decided to leave this as is . I mean it's not like anyone is going to read this but me so it doesn't really matter what I say. Example: Marbles don't float in Ketchup . Now why would I say that ..... Because I can hahahahahaha Laugh with me , laugh with me  !! ahahahahaha   "
11684,3738552,"02,July,2004",2004-07-02,"    You know it's odd sometimes how you can find small parts of enlightenment in everyday life. Case in point , the other day I found my own little piece of nirvana in the movie Return of the king . Yes , I know a very fanboyish thing to say . However it is true , the really odd thing is where it came from . Now I have been studying religion for as long as I can remember , I started with Greek and roman in like second grade and have been chugging along ever since. It is one of my favorite topics of discussion.  Anyway in that time I have come across many different concepts of the afterlife, what it is , how you get there , ect ect . But watching that movie kind of put it in focus a bit for me . I was watching the scene where Gandlaf was talking to the bo-bo hobbit about how the afterlife was great and he shouldn't be afraid to die . This to me was a very powerful scene , mostly thanks to Sir Ian Mckellen's great acting , and great writing my one of the masters. It really made me stop and think about all the stupid stuff I deal with everyday and how it doesn't really matter , because when it's all said and done I get to go and feast and fight with my ancestors for all time in paradise .  What could be better than that , I mean aside from being a rich good looking porn star. By the way if any of you haven't read the LOTR series I suggest it. Tis one of those things everyone should read in their life . After that you can move on to Heinlein , the stories are just as good but a lot more debauchery .   "
11685,3738552,"01,July,2004",2004-07-01,"    So I get on here today praying , hoping , wishing that someone or something has read my shiny new blog post . It was not there . Now im pretty sure I saved it and looked at it after it was written but mayhaps I did not do something correctly .       Damn shame really as it was great blog work , it was funny , smart , thought provoking and witty to no end . It would have made me an instant star , women would want me and men would want to be me . Alas I am here now but because of my own stupidity or error you don't get to read one the greatest pieces of literature ever written . Sad   "
21091,3752323,"26,June,2004",2004-06-26,"   Sundays are the bastards of the week. People like them on Friday but hate them on Saturday. On a Friday, you know that you don't have to go to work tomorrow and the day after tomorrow, but on Saturday, when you get up at 12 noon with a headache because of too many bloody maries yesterday, you are thinking 'Oh NO!', only one more day of cessation of chores, after which, it's back to the grinding mill! HEEEEEEELP!!  "
21092,3752323,"25,June,2004",2004-06-25,"   Let's say that this guy named A kills another guy named B. Let us also say that A meticulously planned the whole thing and then carried out the plan to the T and was successful in murdering B. Mission Accomplished! The Police catch A and get hold of enough evidence to get a conviction. The judge sentences A to death. Let's call the judiciary apparatus C. Now, C is planning to kill A. C has made meticulous preparations to make sure that A dies. Then, C carries out this meticulous plan to the T and is successful in killing A. Pray tell, what's the difference between A and C?  	People sometimes say that the mere presence of capital punishment in the judiciary system of a state is a deterrent for people so that less number of murders and killings are committed. However, we can see that capital punishment has not deterred anyone from actually committing a murder because murders are committed in states with capital punishment as rampantly as those without. Therefore, this argument is nullified.  	Also, what I think is that the judiciary should not just vengefully mete out slaps on the wrist (or on the neck, for that matter) and make sure that justice really is served. If justice demands an eye for an eye then what's the difference between the civilized world and the Taliban?   	Let's say that a person is executed and somewhere in the future, new evidence comes to light that exonerates the person. What does the state do? How does the state make the person come back to life? The state has no right to take what it cannot give back in the event of a mistake committed on its part. If, however, this person were not executed but was kept in a pennitentiary for life (and I mean for life, with no parole), then the state could release them and ask their forgiveness for the time that the state took from them. This is, I think, better than saying sorry to the family of a deceased. 	 	So, it makes one wonder what the difference between capital punishment and murder really is.  "
21093,3752323,"25,June,2004",2004-06-25,"   This was a shocker right now! I saw news from India on NBC 10 news at 4! The news, however, was about the ""Rolling Seer."" It showed a half-naked guy who has rolled (yes, literally rolled) the length and breadth of the country and hopes to get a visa to Pakistan so that he can roll into our neighbor (now that's a metaphor that I don't want to laugh at!). Anyway, this shock was somewhat subdued because Indians are traditionally portrayed in the US media as a country of mendicants and snake charmers and this news item only reinforced the fact. They did never show the flight of the GSLV, nor the LCA. They only show these sort of news that reinforce the stereotype.      I did, however, see a news item the other day in Philadelphia Metro that claimed something else. It said, and I quote verbatim, ""The consumer revolution has started in India, what with all the Call Center Workers making such a huge amount of money..."" So what do you say, people, have we graduated from being snake charmers to being call center workers?  "
21094,3752323,"25,June,2004",2004-06-25,"   Hi guys,     This is my first blog, so please bear with me (you are free to bare with me if you are the appropriate sex and age ;-) Anyway, my first blog is actually about why research is so damn important. Research is important because it gives the student money and the professor material to publish. I know, this sounds like the lamest explanation for research, but really, think about it... It's sort of a Catch22 situation. If there is no research, then there won't be enough students and in turn, there will be no research. Ergo, (this is my word for the day!) research is important to keep research alive!  "
21095,3752323,"02,August,2004",2004-08-02,"   I am totally tired of reading mails that project a holier-than-thou attitude and tell a small fable that is supposed to move us into cherishing our friends/parents/realtives/pets/asses/etc and therefore, I have created this real-life scenario. Read on...  Who's poor???  Following is the Holier-than-thou-attitude-wala story of a wealthy father and his wise-beyond-his-years son.  One day a father of a very wealthy family took his son on a trip to the country with the firm purpose of showing his son how poor people live. They spent a couple of days and nights on the farm of what would be considered a very poor family. On their return from their trip, the father asked his son, ""How was the trip?"" ""It was great, Dad."" ""Did you see how poor people live?"" the father asked. ""Oh yeah,"" said the son. ""So, tell me, what did you learn from the trip?"" asked the father. The son answered: ""I saw that we have one dog and they had four. We have a pool that reaches to the middle of our garden and they have a creek that has no end. We have imported lanterns in our garden and they have the stars at night. Our patio reaches to the front yard and they have the whole horizon. We have a small piece of land to live on and they have fields that go beyond our sight. We have servants who serve us, but they serve others. We buy our food, but they grow theirs. We have walls around our property to protect us, they have friends to protect them."" The boy's father was speechless. Then his son added, ""Thanks, Dad, for showing me how poor we are. "" Isn't perspective a wonderful thing? Makes you wonder what would happen if we all gave thanks for everything we have, instead of worrying about what we don't have. Appreciate every single thing you have, especially your friends! Please pass this page on to friends and acquaintances to help them refresh their perspective and appreciation. ""Life is too short and friends are too few.""  Now, look at how the story would have really unfolded if an actually wealthy father had taken his city-bred brat to a village.  One day a father of a very wealthy family took his son on a trip to the country with the purpose of showing his son how the poor and downtrodden live a meaningless and wretched life. They spent a total of two hours in the shit-hole that the farmers called their home. The son started running away from the place as soon as he saw the food that was placed in front of them. The father, who ran behind his son, caught up with him and asked him, ""Now, son, do you see how the poor people live?"" The aghast son replied, ""Yes, dad!"" And he puked a little. The father asked his son, ""So tell me, what did you learn from this trip?"" The son answered, ""I saw that we have two healthy dogs while these farmers have 16 mongrels with attitude problems so bad that no one knows which one will bite you next! We have a swimming pool with clean, chlorinated water, while these wretches have a creek that's filled with industrial pollutants. We have imported lanterns in our garden whereas the hopeless excuse that they call a garden hardly HAS any plants! Our patio reaches to the front yard whereas these excuses for humans are still fighting about which land belongs to whom! We buy organic food whereas they grow shit-stuff full of pesticides and fertilizers that they sell on the market to our less-fortunate city brethren! We have walls around our property to protect us, whereas these assholes don't and that's because they don't HAVE anything worth stealing!"" The boy's father was speechless! Then his son added, ""Thanks dad, for being rich and not making our family live in such shitty surroundings!  NOW THAT'S WHAT I CALL PERSPECTIVE!  "
12094,3753470,"28,July,2004",2004-07-28,"    Think I'll try black font today.&nbsp; Well the last day or two has had alot of ups and downs.&nbsp; We did the spanish day thing and saw Spider Man 2.&nbsp; It was pretty good but some parts seemed funny when they probably shouldn't have.&nbsp; I now owe two people money and have none so I need to get some.&nbsp; OOH, somewhat funny story for you: Erica and Brittany pulled up in my driveway as I was talking to my Mom shirtless and shoeless on the deck...I got ready quickly and found that I had no money (well, like a 2 dollar bill and a whole lot of change, which didn't do me much good.)&nbsp; So I asked mis madre for some and she reveals that she has no cash.&nbsp; So we take the unusual approach to it and she writes a check.&nbsp; Rushing out the door we (Erica, Brittany and I) went and picked up Kevin and we stopped by the bank.&nbsp; I thought for a second and said ""I don't know what to do...someone come with me.""&nbsp; So Kevin and I stood in front of the machine densely and said...""Hmm, well I guess we have to go in.""&nbsp; Needless to say we were like the most conspicuous looking people in the bank that day and we stood around dumbfoundedly for a moment before Kevin said he'd just pay my way in.&nbsp; We then went and ate at subway and lots of confusion occured in the ordering process and Kevin ended up not having enough for my ticket and Brittany had to pay my way in.&nbsp; So, anyway, that's how I owe people money.&nbsp;   I'm sad today because my dog had to be ""put to sleep"" (killed) and that sucks.&nbsp; She was bought as a puppy for me&nbsp;from the pound when I was like 4 or 5 and she was the only red pup in a litter of black ones.&nbsp;   I quit air alert 3 last night...I just didn't feel like doing it and it was getting to push more towards torture than exercise.&nbsp; I'm not sure if&nbsp;that's a good thing or not because Brandon is still doing it.&nbsp; Speaking of Brandon: I believe I FINALLY&nbsp;decided on his position in the band...he's gonna learn guitar and be a rythm guitarist.&nbsp; With the motivation&nbsp;of&nbsp;being in a band and me telling him ""Come on, you're holding us up you son of a pig!"" he'll probably learn relatively quickly.&nbsp;   That's all I can think of&nbsp;right now so, have a good day.&nbsp;   "

A tornado touched down somewhere and it was raining so it got cancelled.  Gannon came back to my house and we did random stuff and talked about Jacob half the night.  The next day (today) we walked up the road to some little old house.  We walked through alot of tall weeds and grasses and stuff to the front porch only to find that the door was locked.  We went around back where the ceiling was caved in and went through that way.  I was caught off guard by a picture of a woman on a wall that someone had drawn on...freaked me out.  We went up stairs and looked through lots of pictures and papers and there was lots of writing on the walls but both the digital camera and camcorder died so...little help there.  Hurricane Charley (haha!) is coming today/tonight....I'M READY FOR HIM!  It'll probably end up as a little breeze but it's been raining on and off all day.  Well...that's about it.  Later.   "

Some guy named Jake....ok, I don't know his last name, and I haven't talked to him yet...but he's been playing bass for five years and sounds good enough to be in.   Maybe I can do something this weekend to liven things up and make things more exciting for all the blog readers...since you have such scandalous fun reading of my fun.  I kinda suck...I have a poster thingy due in english on Friday and haven't started it...but it's a drawing thing, so that'll be pretty easy; I also haven't written anymore on my book!!  It nags at me everyday and I somehow come up with something else to do that is obviously superior in prioritative (that's a word now, if it wasn't a minute ago) rank in my little bubble of procrastination.   I have to go get ready for bed...after I write in my little computer journal thingy (yeah I keep a journal...cuz I'm a fag) OOOH!

Yippee!  only like...175 days left...then 360 more and i'm done forever, always assuming I don't drop out...that's not extremely likely though.  Feelin'  uninspired...think I'll start a fire.  I desperately need to write SOMETHING.  I don't know...song, poem, book, story, whatever.  I'll do that and THEN start that fire.     I got some tricking inspiration by watching Jujimufu in his latest video, and watching the aerial tutorial.  I still don't have the guts to try an aerial so I just did some cartwheels and seeing how I can't even do a one handed cartwheel I need practice.   If you didn't notice I really had and still have nothing to write about...I'm in a kinda weird mood today.  I think I'll go out in the woods or down some trails or something...maybe draw some...write somethin.  Later.   "
12101,3753470,"03,August,2004",2004-08-03,"    I hate double posting on things...nothing big but if anyone didn't know I got a new computer like...umm, i dunno, a few months ago.  And we left our old one at ncol cuz it was screwed up.  Just now they figure out that they can fix it and it's gonna be fixed by next week, so I'm gonna have my own computer then...which is cool cuz doing all my randon non-porn-related things on the computer is annoying when my parents and brother are right behind me.  This means there is gonna be some massive rearrangement in my room cuz my room is little and kinda cluttered.  Umm...I  think  that's all.  Go be cool expressive unique people and go smell some flowers and pet some kitties and hug some old fellas.   "
12102,3753470,"03,August,2004",2004-08-03,"    Well...back to school tomorrow...suckage.  But that's ok cuz i'm gonna...wait, no...i'm not gonna see my friends because I have no classes with them.  I have two classes with Matt and one with Emily but that's all that I know of.  I'm gonna take my anger out by being a jackass in school and maybe vandalizing something just for the hell of it...hehe i love insurrection.   I went shopping today and got like 3 pairs of pants and 2 shirts.  Now I have something to wear!  Goody!  OOH, this catchy kinda upbeat music with a hint of techno (and a dash of paprika, hh) was on in Goodys (where I was shopping) and I was being stupid and strutting in tune with the music and doing hand motions and head bobbing, half way to embarrass my Mom.  I came to an intersection where the little tile path splits and there was some big advertisement there and I went around it, and this kid was going all out like it was a disco floor with his arms flying and feet moving.  And it wasn't like a little kid...he was a probably 10 or 11 redneck looking kid and he just stopped really abruptly when he saw that I saw him and I just started laughing to myself cuz I was just acting stupid and that kid was doing so much more.  Oh, and I heard ""Another Postcard"" by Barenaked Ladies while I was there and that's funny because it's a kinda funny song you wouldn't expect to hear there.  I finally finished To Sir With Love and I guess it was ok but it wasn't my kinda thing.  I read cliffnotes (spelling?) for Siddhartha and that seemed much more like a book I would have liked to read all the way through.     I found another artist that whoever's reading this needs to check out: Shinedown.  I've only heard the song ""45"" but it's really good and it's been stuck in my head.  That's like the first good artist I've heard of on MTV...well it  was  the rock countdown though, so I guess there are more decent artists on that.  That's about all for now...later.   "
9418,3757297,"27,June,2004",2004-06-27,"   I subscribed to a newsletter when I was pregnant with my 2nd child.  After 40 weeks, I thought the newsletters would just stop, considering that most pregnancies are around 40 weeks.  They did not.  I got week 41 and I thought, â€œwell, some people are up to 2 weeks late, so maybe that is why I am still getting them?â€  However, when I got the newsletter for week 44, I knew there was a problem.  After a few weeks of messages with titles like â€œHello, you are now 50 weeks pregnant.  How do you feel?â€ I decided to try to â€œunsubscribe.â€  So I clicked on the â€œunsubscribeâ€ button only to find that they will require my password in order to stop sending me ridiculous emails.  Well it has been approximately 40 weeks since I signed up for this newsletter initially, so not only did I not remember the password, I did not even know my username!  Well of course you need your user name to access your password on the odd chance that in 40 weeks you may have forgotten it.  So I am basically doomed to receive these emails until I die or change my email address, whichever happens first.  Every time I get another email I just want to scream â€œI am apparently pregnant with an almost 2 year old.  How the fuck do you think I feel?!â€  "
9419,3757297,"26,June,2004",2004-06-26,"   To start out this log or blog, I will list a few things that I do not understand.  Maybe someone else understands these things and can clue me in?   *Pop up adds for software to eliminate Pop ups. Isnâ€™t this blackmail??? Basically they are telling you that you have to buy their product to get rid of a problem they are causing or else you will continue to be harassed. This would be like some guy walking up to you and hitting you repeatedly until you agreed to buy his service as a bodyguard to protect you from people hitting youâ€¦  *The auto-glass people calling me to ask if I have a cracked or dinged windshield that I want repaired. If I wanted their services, I would call them. Do they believe that there are people who desperately want their services, but for some reason canâ€™t get a-hold of them? As if someone is sitting at home and gets their call and exclaims, â€œOh thank goodness you called!!! I have been trying to reach you for days now, but could not get through!â€ (Probably because the phone line was busy due to the fact that they were calling everyone in the city just to make sure nobody wanted to talk to them.) Other businesses do not do thisâ€¦I never get a call from McDonaldâ€™s asking if I am hungry and wanted to buy a hamburger from them.  *Maxi pads designed for thong underwearâ€¦no explanation requiredâ€¦  *People who say â€œno offenseâ€ right before blurting something completely rude, as though â€œno offenseâ€ is a qualifier that prohibits you from becoming upset at their commentâ€¦i.e. â€œNo offense, but you look like you have gained a lot of weightâ€¦â€  *7 day return policiesâ€¦Are these establishments worried that their products will not hold up past 7 days?  *How doctorâ€™s offices will refuse to see you and often charge you a fee if you are more than 15 minutes late for an appointment or do not show up or cancel without giving 24 hours notice, but will leave you sitting in the waiting room for 3 hours when you arrived early, and not offer you any discount on your bill for the inconvenience of the wait!  "
9420,3757297,"26,June,2004",2004-06-26,   Interesting...I'll get started tomorrow...  
9421,3757297,"23,July,2004",2004-07-23,"   Well I have exhausted (nice word choice I think) every possible option for natural sleep aids, and am now just giving up. Like an idiot I drank coffee with dinner, although I could not sleep last night either, and had no coffee then.I have spent the last 4 or so hours surfing television channels in search of quality programming (*smirk*) and it is just not there.   I started out watching Disney channelâ€™s â€œBug Juiceâ€ which is like MTVâ€™s â€œThe Real Worldâ€ reality show, but for pre-teens:) It is basically a show about pre-teen and teen kids at camp.  Then, I started watching old reruns of â€œL.A. Lawâ€ on A&E. Not a bad show, although the episode p*ssed me off because a man whose father was a diplomat violently raped a girl and then was set free due to â€œdiplomatic immunity!â€ So now I have one more thing to be politically p*ssed aboutâ€¦  After that I started watching an infomercial about a tape that guarantees flat abs in only 6 weeks. LOL, if I had an extra $60 I might consider it! I am so tired of my little pooch! Something tells me though that there is fine print (so fine that I can not see it without a magnifying glass) that reads something like â€œResults are not typical. Likely the only weight you will loose is the 1 lb. From the $60 weighing down your wallet! This means you H!â€ After looking at about 300 obviously touched up â€œafterâ€ photos, I switched the channelâ€¦  Then there was the infomercial for the â€œamazing mattress!â€ This amazing mattress was supposed to form to your body shape. (I usually would describe a mattress that did this as â€œold and worn out,â€ but that just does not have the same ring to it as â€œamazing!â€) Also, it was supposed to stay still while your partner moved. I guess the idea was that you would not wake up your loved one. The interesting part was the way they demonstrated it though. Here was the setup:  A 25 year old, blonde, 95 lb., Cheerleader type girl stands at one end of the bed in a semi-short red negligee. A wine glass half full of water is placed at the other end. The clueless blonde starts jumping up and down on her corner of the bed while an official sounding male voice commentates, â€œLook how the glass of water does not spill as Candy moves about!!!â€ Yeahâ€¦I am sure there are a great many people out there looking at the WATER;) I am not sure if they proved any point with the demonstration, but I am sure that many a man watching was happy that the official voice was able to make Candy â€œmove about.â€ I am sure many men readily began practicing their official voices in hopes that they too could get someone to â€œmove aboutâ€ for a harmless experiment:)  When you start searching the channels for a better infomercial, you know that you have hit an all time low.  So now I sit here, too tired to clean, too tired to read, too tired to write anything worth anything, and worst of all, too tired to sleep. I guess I am back to bed to stare at the black ceiling again, or to make shapes in my mind from the lit numbers of the alarm clock, or maybe I should ""move about"" on my corner of the bed;p  "
9422,3757297,"07,July,2004",2004-07-07,"   I wish that candidates would debate the issues and not engage in so many personal attacks.  I wish that there was a ""perfect"" mix of liberalism and conservatism in a candidate that actually had a chance of winning in our 2 party system:)  I wish that people would stop saying ""grass roots.""  I wish that fat free mayonaise tasted more like actual food.  I wish my Mother In Law were sentient.  I wish that my husband had the day off work:)  I wish Law and Order were on every second of every day...7 times a day is not really enough for me.  I wish I knew Kim Possible.  I wish for more wishes.  "
9423,3757297,"01,July,2004",2004-07-01,"   What is the world coming to!?  It is *only* 3:30 am and there is nothing on TV!;)  Basically, the only thing still on is Profiler (and similar shows), Infomercials, and advertisements for sleeping aids!  I donâ€™t like watching ads for sleep aids while I am awake at night.  I realize that they market them at night to catch an intended audience, but people who have trouble sleeping watch TV in the day time too.  Perhaps if I saw the commercials earlier in the day I would have a chance at obtaining the products so that I could sleep at night instead of watching their ad.  However, with their ads airing at night, I have little chance of obtaining the product after seeing the ad.  It feels like teasing to me, like when I see a Pizza commercial after the restaurant has already closed;)  Infomercials are bad enough without additional commentary LOL, so I wonâ€™t touch much on this one.  The fact is that it is both boring and disturbing to watch someone cut cans with knives (as though this is a normal activity of knife owners), mop ceilings with extended handled mops, and build muscles on contraptions that look as though they were designed by the military for torture.  The main problem with shows like Profiler, and other intense crime shows is that at 3:30 am, they scare the shit out of me!  I can barely watch these programs at 3:30 in the afternoon without constantly checking behind me!  So these are the choices I am left withâ€¦Of course I do have a DVD player and a VCR which I could utilizeâ€¦but again it is 3:30 amâ€¦and I am not thinking clearly;)  "

Now i dont know no man that is would stoop that low just to get a piece of pus that is some ol nonsense. Now that leaves me to think he really have some issues going on within himself. "

3318,3759734,"31,July,2004",2004-07-31,"    GOOD BLACK MEN  ""Good Black Men"" you know and a few women that need to read it...   Good Black men are indeed all around. We pass them on the streets, in the malls and the halls at work. Most we can`t see because we don`t know what a good man really looks like.  He usually isn`t flashy enough or rich enough to turn our heads. He might not wear a suit or push a Ex. He might not have a ""body like Arnold with a Denzel face."" But, as you mature, you realize it`s better to find someone who`s got your back than someone who turns your head.   A good man doesn`t agree wholeheartedly with everything you say. He doesn`t just tell you what you want to hear and do the opposite. He doesn`t declare how sensitive, sweet, caring, sincere, yada yada he is (he wont have to because it shows). He has his own opinions and you may clash, but he doesn`t have to degrade you to prove he`s right. He even admits at times to being wrong, especially if you are willing to do the same.  A good man is not going to meet every item on your checklist. He is human with frailties and faults mixed in with all of his wonderful, strong attributes. He needs your love and respect. He needs to feel that you don`t live to ""catch"" him doing something wrong so you can declare,  ""Aha! I knew you were a dog!!""  A good man doesn`t necessarily give you a huge birthday or Valentine`s gift. He shows his love in the ways that are comfortable to him. Don`t judge him by TV standards. No one is living that fairy tale for real. You`ll miss out on your own fairy tale by buying into the myth that our men are no good. It`s just not true.   Black Men, we salute you, and thank you for who you are and all you`ve done. "

13301,3767918,"27,June,2004",2004-06-27,"    Hi folks, today I create my first blog. I'd never thought of making a blog before, I made this one just to get a Gmail account :P but hopefully it will be fun.   What I've Been Doing:   Well yesterday was my girlfriend's birthday and she came over for the whole day - most of which we spent naked ;) I bought her a necklace, a union jack thong (that she asked for and looks great in :D), a rose and, using the Far Cry engine, I made her a map - a collection of desert island that spelt out ""Simon [heart] Kirsty"". She loved it all and I got a very... nice thankyou ;) Oh, and I made her a cake and dinner too.  I had maths homework to do, but I've forgotten how to do most of it, so whether I will get round to it is questionable.   What I've Been Playing:   I've been playing Hitman Contracts on PC the last couple of days and I'm liking it. I seem to resort to violece a bit too much for the genre but its fun and that's what counts.   In the News:   According to Chinese state media, dozens of drug dealers have been sentenced to death. Not because China is that tough on drugs/barbaric, but to celebrate International Anti-Drugs Day! How quaint...  Michael Moore's new film, Faranheit 9/11, has made $8 million on the first day. I'm quite looking forward to seeing this film [expect my opinions on it soon] but I fear most people will see it because it's the thing to do, and not really watch the film the way it should be watched.   Other Stuff:   All should be on the look out for a new worm being spread by popular websites. The code exploits a hole in Internet Explorer and redirects you to a Russian site that tries to install the code. To check if you are infected:  Click the Start button and then click on Search   Make sure you choose the option to look through all files and folders   Search for files called Kk32.dll and Surf.dat   If infected use up to date anti-virus software to remove malicous code  That's all for now, see you... whenever.  cvx  Thought of the Post: Is mockery a form of ignorance or a form of enlightenment?

13302,3767918,"28,June,2004",2004-06-28,"    Hey ho. Back from school, felt like a very long day and I'm uber tired so I must get to bed early tonight. Unfortunately this means I will have more homework to do tomorrow which means I won't be able to play Planetside until Wednesday which I really need to [see  What I've Been Playing ]   What I've Been Doing:   School today. My English teacher tells me that she forgot to right on my coursework draft that I had to put in a load of stuff on camera angles (media piece on Bowling for Columbine) so I have English coursework to do :( I also have to revise for my maths exam on Wednesday and do loads of science homework for then. Not... cool...   What I've Been Playing:   Hitman Contracts last night, got quite far and got another 'Silent assassin' rating so all is well. Also, I have been up for a promotion to Legion Officer in my Planetside outfit the Renegade Legion. This, the second highest rank available would be totally awesome but I have little time to play right now. I was hoping to get a to of commanding done this week but I may not have time :(   In the News:   Two days ahead of schedule, the US have handed power back to the new Iraqi government and Prime Minister Iyad Allawi. The bringing forward of the hand over was probably to prevent any large scale terror attacks that may have been planned to mark the occasion.  At the NATO summit in Istanbul this week, the 26 NATO states have agreed to offer training to Iraq's new Security forces. Hopefully this will see Coalition troops leave Iraq sooner as their own forces can take more of the weight.  Also at the summit, police clashed with protestors - protesting about pretty much everything - and used water cannons, batons and tear gas to disperse the crowd.  To fight of Google.com's Gmail service, currently in the beta testing stage, Hotmail are boosting the free email storage size to 250MB. This however is still far short of Gmail's 1GB.   Other Stuff:   I've decided to request an increase in my allowance. I currently get a meager Ã‚Â£5 a week which I can't live on. Ã‚Â£10 or Ã‚Â£15 would be much fairier I feel and bring me inline with my friends. Whether I get it is questionable... Was hoping to take Kirsty's cake round today so I could see her, if only for a few minutes but my family ate it all :( So I won't see her until Saturday evening which pisses me off because I miss her soooooo much!  cvx  Thought of the Post: If one experienced everything it is possible to experience, would they still have desire?

13303,3767918,"28,June,2004",2004-06-28,"    Hi folks. I am currently sitting in a business studies IT lesson. I'm rather annoyed because Lizzie wanted to stay the weekend in Bournemouth with me Kirsty and Courtney, but my parents (for the first time in years) refused to let me. So I'll only be going for the day - sometime in the summer.  I can't see Kirsty until Saturday which is annoying and it will only be in the evening. She's going shopping with her birthday money and Lizzie won't let me come because her boyfriend Courtney can't come and they were meant to be fucking all day but Kirsty dragged her along lol.  So I've got this week free. I'll probably go into town with some people and spend as much time as possible sleeping - I've been very tired recently.  Also, I've got sports day on Thursday which sucks arse. Hopefully I won't be doing anything though.  My mates Ben and Vicki broke up over the weekend. They had been going out for at least a year I think so that's a real blow. Apparently he just stopped fancying her...  But I think he still does. I think, after a certain period of time, the awe of how beautiful someone is just wears off and you kind of take it for granted how amazing they look. I'm not sure how involved the were sexually, but maybe it just got boring. I mean, if you do the same thing day after day it must just get boring and you stop looking forward to it and it seems like you don't fancy the person anymore.  cvx  Thought of the Post: How can women understand those weird whispering sounds they make to each other?!

13304,3767918,"29,June,2004",2004-06-29,"    Sooooo tired... I very nearly fell asleep in science but was prevented by the uncomfortable chairs.  I need sleep but I never seem to get to bed early...  What I've Been Doing:  School and being very tired and missing Kirsty an unbelievable amount. Hopefully I won't be in sports day - my team captain says he won't put me in unless he has to, so fingers crossed.  Episode 37 of Red vs Blue came out last night. Best one in a while. Quite long and lots of story too.  Kirsty is depressed :( She's got lots of coursework to do, can't see me all week and might not be able to go on a boat trip she's been wanting to go on for ages. If she can't go then I'll have to do something really nice for her (dunno what lol) and I'll try to make Saturday as nice as possible (next time I see her).  In the News:  Saddam Hussein is set to be handed over to the Iraqi authorities. He will be held in Iraqi cusotdy and tried by an Iraqi court for various crimes.  Militants in Iraq have released three Turkish men after they promised not to work for America again. It seems the militants are trying to keep in Arab nations' good books by letting Muslims go free whenever possible.  A woman has, for the first time, successfully conceived a child after having an ovary transplant.  A bodged terrorist attack resulted in the injury of three Turkish cleaners... A booby trapped bomb planted on board a plane exploded AFTER passengers had left the plane, injuring three cleaners.  Other Stuff:  Grrr... Still no email about Gmail. I need a new email address sharpish...  My mother laughed at the suggest of an allowance increase so I shall procure the money from my Grandmother's will every week. Tis my money anyway.  Apparently I am not allowed to use the phone upstairs anymore... Looks like my parents are trying to enforce rules again. I'm not having that. I shall continue to use it upstairs but I will now strive to phone mobiles instead of landlines and use it off-peak. Mwuhahaha. Also I haven't spoken to my friends in Denmark and the US in a while... I think a very long phone call to each one is in order...   "
13305,3767918,"30,June,2004",2004-06-30,"    What I've Been Doing:  Maths exam today. Was fine, very easy apart from one question which I didn't have a clue about.  What I've Been Playing:  Just about to play Planetside. We're having a King of the Hill tournament which should be fun.  In the News:  A tube strike proposed by the RMT has gone ahead today causing widespread disruption in London.   Two militants and one policeman have been killed in gun battles in the capital of Saudi Arabia - Riyadh.  A new system is being trialled in the UK to stop plagiarism in universities. The software will search for blogs of text or entire essays lifted from websites. It seems unlikely that it will be able to detect altered text e.g.  ""America and the USSR were the main rivals during the cold war.""  changed to  ""Russia was the main rival of America during the cold war.""  However, it should prevent simple ""copy & paste essays"".  Other Stuff:  Sports day tomorrow... It might rain but otherwise, its quite likely I'll be running the relay :( oh well.  Now I'm off to play Planetside :)   "
13306,3767918,"01,July,2004",2004-07-01,"    What I've Been Doing:  Twas sports day today. I thought it was going to be rained off, but it wasn't. Luckily all my team turned up and were healthy so I didn't have to run :D Watched a film in English which was ok. Going to be playing Planetside tonight hopefully. I'll get some screenshots to make a better signature for Vasquez (my character's name).  What I've Been Playing:  Planetside. Lead a platoon last night. We resecured Amerish after a few hours and I got a few Command Experience Points. We were going to play a king of the hill game at a tower on the test server but it was just crap so we didn't bother.  In the News:  Saddam Hussein had his first court appearance today. He mocked the court and said he was still president. He refused to sign his legal papers and called the court a ""theatre"".  Construction of the barrier the Israeli military is constructing on the West Bank has been halted by an Israeli court. They say although the wall is legal, some sections cause too much disruption to the lives of Palestinians and must be re-routed.  Other Stuff:  Sony are working on a new Walkman model. It'll be a digital music player (an MP3 player that...Dosn't play... MP3s... lol, all will be explained) instead of an antique tape player. It is set to be Ã‚Â£55 cheaper and with considerably more space than the top iPod model (which it is settot rival). However, there is a catch. It will only play music in sony's own special format - so u have to buy your music digitally from the sonyonlinee music store. However I'm sure some genius will make a program to convert MP3s to theSonyy format.  Can't wait until Saturday when I can see Kirsty!   "
13307,3767918,"03,July,2004",2004-07-03,"    What I've Been Doing:  Pretty average day at school on Friday. Saw Kirsty today :D haven't seen her for a week. She went shopping and blew her birthday money, then we went back to hers. Went on her new (huge) trampoline and... Other stuff ;)  What I've Been Playing:  Been leading platoons on Planetside, getting some CEP but not much :( good fun though :)  In the News:  I forgot to read the papers/websites/watch the news on Friday, so you'll just have to make something up for yourself.  Brazil has passed a law banning the carrying of firearms in public and making it illegal to own an unlicensed gun - with licensing rules similar to those in the UK. There is also to be a referendum to on whether to ban guns outright.  A car containing four Rumanians and bearing German number plates, has crashed into the security fence at the Houses of parliament. Two men have been arrested and police are trying to determine if the crash was deliberate or not.  Other Stuff:  Microsoft have upgraded their search engine to come close to the quality of commercial search engines like Google. They are also planning to release their own search engine software later this year.  The Hubble telescope has discovered around one hundred new planets orbiting distant stars. This makes the total of known planets to two hundred and thirty.   "
13297,3769478,"31,July,2004",2004-07-31,"   PADERBORN   (Panzerland)  -- After nearly three weeks in offline design and development, the forums for Panzerland came online on the 28th. Kaiser Von Wulf happily announced that the forums would now be open to the public, after a private testing phase on various browsers was done to insure compatability. The forums will prove to be a major part of future Panzerlander development, serving as the communications hub of the online-based Empire. Yet the number of sub fora have, thus far, been kept to the bare minimum. A general discussion area, a beer hall for entertainment, the kaiser's court and several other government branches have been established. The Kaiser noted in an interview that a forum for every singular category of government would be wasteful at the present time, but further noted that additional fora may be added if and when they become necessecary. In the meantime, activities will be focused on the present fora and their requisite discussions.  Design of the forums was inspired, in part, by the Kingdom of Gotzborg. Their own astonishingly well-designed forums, designed by the talented HRM King August of Gotzborg, share both cultural and graphical qualities with the designs used in Paznerland. Yet in order not to plagarise the work of His Majesty, only the basic premise of the design was used, such as transparent buildings/cityscapes adorning each forum. Attention of the nation will now be focused from forum and website to more pertinent matters, such as development of the constitution, the national history and gaining more citizens to fill vacant government offices. The Kasier noted, however, that he hopes to hold off on constitutional development until such time as more citizens are available to provide input on its contents. He has instead begun work on the detailed history of Panzerland, of which only the first two chapters are complete. In addition, he has begun an ad campaign to gain more citizens.  Meanwhile, the Kaiser has opened the beer hall to the public and invited anyone who wishes to, to stop by and say hello. Likewise, the Ministry of State is also now open and accepting foreign dignitaries for those who wish to establish diplomatic relations with the Empire. Either way, we hope to see you in Panzerland.   Related Links  Forums  urlLink http://p205.ezboard.com/bpanzerland   Website  urlLink http://www.geocities.com/evilsnapple/ "
13298,3769478,"25,July,2004",2004-07-25,"   The Empire of Panzerland was formed today in an official ceremony headed by His Majesty, Kaiser Ryszard Von Wulf, the first Emperor of Panzerland. The Empire was formed out of the ashes of the failed Virtual City of Netropolis project, which was cancelled due to unforseen obstacles, most unfortunately. In lieu of this project, Netropolitan Duke Ryan was re-christened with a heritage&nbsp;German name at the Cathedral in Aachen as Ryszard Von Wulf. With the Von Wulf assets established and other business agreements brought to closure, Ryszard purchased a division of Panzers with his own money, a parcel of land, and established the foundations of Panzerland. Embracing the noble military teachings of such great men as Erwin Rommel and Manfred Von Richthofen, a basis for the Empire was drawn up and organised.  Panzerland will fall under an administration echoing military organisation and a chain of command similar to that of an army. The Emperor rules absolute, with a close circle of advisors and staff. This is not to say, however, that Panzerland will be entirely without a voice for its people. The Emperor has assured the public that there will be a legislature established in which the public can make a difference in the affairs of government. Military and the art or war will, though, remain the dominant moving force behind Panzerlander society. After all, when literally translated, Panzerland means ""Armor Land"", and indeed, Panzerlanders are an armored people. More details on the progress of Panzerland will be posted as it becomes available. "
13299,3769478,"13,August,2004",2004-08-13,"   PADERBORN   (Panzerland)  -- The Republic of Slobovia officially became Panzermannsch Slobowien this week when Kaiser Von Wulf concluded the deal with Slobovian President Troy Thompson to make the nation a protectorate of the empire.  The ruling was made in the form of a decree issued by the Kaiser, which sets the rules and stipulations by which Slobovia will be governed whilst it is part of Panzerland. This includes guarantees of maintaining territorial integrity and recognising Troy Thompason as the leader-in-absence of the nation. Upon Mr. Thompson's return to micronationalism - of which the details have not been specified - Slobovia will be allowed to determine its own path. Be it a resumption of independence or in maintaining its affiliation with Panzerland.  In the meantime, the Panzerlander government has assumed control of all Slobovian state assets and government offices. These will be incorporated into the imperial government  and Panzerland will attempt to rejuvinate Slobovian foreign affairs and treaties, upholding them as if they were signed by the Kaiser himself. Future foreign affairs will, however, be directed by Paderborn. Kaiser Von Wulf has chosen Don Diego de Almagro to hold the position of Slobovian Steward while it remains a protectorate. Mr. Amagro has been hired by the government via a worker visa, and thus does not hold citizenship. But his past record shows him to be an experienced leader and he is sure to prove an apt choice to guard the Slobovians while their leader is away. "
13300,3769478,"03,August,2004",2004-08-03,"   KREISAU   (Panzerland)  -- The Republic of Slobovia entered negotiations this week with the Empire of Panzerland over the possibility of becoming a protectorate. With most of its citizens having gone inactive, the fate of Slobovia has been questioned abroad. Slobovia, which has been declining in activity since it seceded from the Arminian Community over two months ago, culminated in its slow-down with the announcement by President Troy Thompson that the nation would be ""making serious changes"". These revolved around Mr. Thompson's own departure, albeit temporary, from micronations for an unspecified amount of time.  This prompted Kaiser Von Wulf, at one time a Slobovian himself, to speak with President Thompson about the future of the Slobovians. As it would turn out, Mr. Thompson was seeking a friendly state of similar interests to establish a protectorate over Slobovia while he is away. Such a protectorate would have to, of course, guarantee the territorial integrity of the nation and make assurances that upon the return of the President, Slobovia be allowed to determine its own future. Von Wulf has made these assurances and has entered into stronger negotiations with Thompson in order to finalise the deal.  These negotiations are continuing and are expected to culminate in a formal protectorate treaty being signed between the two nations and Slobovia becoming the Panzermannsch Protectorate of Slobowien within the next few weeks. More information on this event will be posted as it becomes available. "
11884,3771600,"28,June,2004",2004-06-28,"   I know that there's a biblical reason for fornication and all the complications like STDs and how condoms don't give you the 100% protection. Pre-marital sex has all these and more I know, but the question that I asked was why does it have to be such a taboo? Why does it have to be such a taboo until you cannot talk about it openly? What happened to proper sex education? Let people do what they want about their lives-whether or not they want to unwrap that special present is their business not ours.  About homosexuality, I think that they are just people confused about their sexuality, but that does not give us a right to ostracise them, does it? They probably just need more time to really find out bout themselves but we, instead of giving them advice or a helping hand, treat them like sub-humans. I don't want to give you guys the wrong impressoion about my parents-they don't encourage pre-marital sex nor do they oppose it either. They strongly oppose sleeping around and one-night stands- believe me, they do.   "
11885,3771600,"27,June,2004",2004-06-27,"   I was talking to somebody yesterday about the cultural differences between Western culture and Eastern culture. Firstly, about pre-marital sex..My parents have been pretty open about this topic, so I knew about it when I was quite young- around 7 maybe. I've been given free rein to do whatever I want with my life but anything that I do, I must accept the consequences- good or bad. In eastern culture, it is normal to be a virgin or lose your virginity only when you're married. I was brought up differently, you can have pre-marital sex BUT you must know what you are getting into and what the possible consequences are..Why does the eastern culture regard sex as a taboo?? That I don't understand. There was one columnist in the STAR newspaper who said that her child thought that if you kiss the opposite sex, you can get a baby. How ridiculous is that? I mean, I'm fine with the ""don't have sex till u're married"" thing but why does it have to be such a taboo until kids don't get their proper sex education? I acknowledge the fact that pre-marital sex can lead to unplanned pregnancies and other messy situations.. But why make it such a taboo? Now, about homosexuality. I have a couple of homosexual friends who tell me their problems- our society's view of them, their family's views and acceptance. They are just normal human beings who breathe, eat, and drink but they just are attracted to members of their gender. I don't see why it's so hard for people to accept them. They are just humans. And yet we treat them like outcasts. With all that said, I've got to go now..bye! p.s.: I'd really appreciate feedback! Thanks!   "

13042,3771668,"30,June,2004",2004-06-30,"   For my Beloved Cat:  in the midst of the bustle, two souls collided. disregarding derision, two souls connected. the joy of empathy once found, soured when one refused to be bound. exquisite pleasure became exquisite pain, yet how a soul yearns for both again. how could the healing ever begin, above the deafening ache loss brings. understanding is lost, a bond goes awry. could it ever be restored before a soul dies? the allure of vast pecuniary gain, brings about a loss previously ordained. what is a heart that is being bled? a product of a liaison gone bad? arose from myriad snowballed events? or simply an organ that continues to rant? the anguish unbearable like the noonday sun. those who care matter not, save one.  "
13043,3771668,"29,June,2004",2004-06-29,"   The weather is a little more accomodating than yesterday. The equator can be pretty unforgiving in terms of ambient temperature. Overcast clouds paint a depressing cast to an already drab sky. A brief respite from the heat, but definitely not an environment in which you would want to start every day in. Work is overwhelming, so much to do, yet direction is lacking. Caught a little of the Lee Kuan Yew interview yesterday night. His opinionated ribbing of Malays and the central government in Malaysia, and their racist, biased, treatment of Chinese and Indian citizens, won my sincere applause. Can't wait for tomorrow's first edition. Eager to see how far the issue can escalate for the press in Malaysia (no shred of journalistic integrity when the government is concerned) will probably be having a field day. Viva la equal rights.

13044,3771668,"28,June,2004",2004-06-28,"   My very first blog posting. Feels weird somehow but could be due to the lack of sleep that i've been experiencing lately. I'm a business development manager for a manufacturer of Car bodykits called ARS. We've been exhibiting at the Singapore Expo Dreamcars Asia show since last Tuseday and haven't had a day off yet. The cars in the show were ok, the show was pretty biased towards performance tuning. Racing queens were great tho, chirpy, friendly and hot as red pokers, so if u gals are reading this, u kick mucho ass (will post some pix when i get to it) Writing this blog at work seems wrong somehow but I'm beyond caring. Slave driver of a boss had me working 14-15 hours since the bloody exhibition started :  "
13045,3771668,"13,July,2004",2004-07-13,"   Just like that, life throws you a curve ball sometimes. Sad thing is it lands in your crotch. Life really sucks.  "
13046,3771668,"08,July,2004",2004-07-08,"   I've oftened wondered as to why we pay such exorbitant prices for Brembo brake kits. Do their calipers offer something so extreme for them to be able to command such a premium? The same goes for struts manufactured by Tein, Koni or Kayaba. Defi Link BF meters would cost you a small fortune, and Sparco bucket seats often have extravagant price tags attached to their designer carbon-kevlar backsides. A GReddy turbo charger would set you back a couple of k. Do the performance of these performance parts really justify what the consumer actually forks out for them? Nevertheless, a plethora of logos on your door panel signifying the ""existence"" of such parts beneath the bonnet of your ride will gain you instant recognition as a force to be reckoned with. Do Nike Shox really make you jump higher, and add pizazz to your game? Does a diamond from Sookees assure you that you are as pretty as the fossilized piece of carbon that you, or some misbegotten sod, spent half a month's salary on? Does an Armani three piece insinuate that Donald Trump had better watch out? It's funny but unfortunately, I'm not immune either to such name brand envy. sigh.... Guess it's time to accumulate more loot for the meaningless accumulation of more loot.  "
13047,3771668,"06,July,2004",2004-07-06,"   I'd like to apologize to my blog for the recent hiatus. It felt weird to pen thoughts when I'm depressed to no end. At this point in time, I'd like to pose a few rhetorical question. One feels deeply for another, yet knows that he or she is not perfect. Nevertheless, the other demands perfection. Can the process of attaining perfection be, in point of fact, possible? Could the other's desire for perfection denote a need for something just a little short of perfection, with all else being unacceptable? Is it possible for a person to emulate the sensitivity and pious characteristics of Saints like Mother Teresa and Francis Xavier? Is it possible to integrate such characteristics into the hustle and bustle of reality (being the constant rat race all of us are somehow involved in unless you are a bazillionaire)? Does the act of loving and caring for another in silent yet extreme distress mean much less than overt expressions of affection? Does thinking and yearning for someone every second of the day signify something not to be taken for granted? Does it indicate something so precious, and thus something to be treasured, like the golden fleece or does it entail that one should drink from the waters of lethe? Dammit my head hurts.  "
13048,3771668,"01,July,2004",2004-07-01,"   Recently, I've made significant progress and clinched a few sizable deals. Most people would be extremely satisfied with fiduciary profit, but I'm hard pressed to tell all you loyal readers out there that the same applies to me. In truth, food lacks flavor, the air i breathe is rancid, and success in my career provides scant comfort. My relationship with the woman that I adore more than life itself, is tethering on the thinnest of threads. Let this be a lesson to you kids out there. Don't screw your relationship up, especially when you truly care for the other. Heed little warnings and admonitions otherwise one day, you'll be able to identify with yours truly (a fate that i wouldn't want to wish upon anybody else, except maybe the road bully that threatened to smash my head in with his steering lock some time back, but that's a story for another time). May the Lord bless all you good people out there.  "
1616,3779062,"28,June,2004",2004-06-28,"   So, I am doing this because I have been told by a friend I need to rant to the world, and I think he is right. Although, today is ok and I don't seem to have anything to rant about. Oh well, the day is young, I am sure that will change.   "
1617,3779062,"30,July,2004",2004-07-30,   I am bored. I am bored. I am bored. I am bored. I am bored. I am bored.   
1618,3779062,"24,July,2004",2004-07-24,"   So, I just found out my grandmother died last night. Apparently people paged my at 2 am but I didn't hear it, so I just found out. So, why don't I feel anything? Is it because it was expected? I think she is in a better place now. She is no longer suffering, which makes me happy. And now I have to go to a wedding today. Not really what I feel like doing, but oh well. At least I will be with friends, and they will understand. And they will make sure I get nice and pissed tonight, which I think I need.   "
1619,3779062,"19,July,2004",2004-07-19,"   O  k, so you ever have those days where you just feel like shit? I am having a bad one today. My Grandmother is in the hospital dying and has been for the last few days. But because of my work I haven't been able to be there much. So, I went to work this morning and just felt horrible being there. It was actually making me ill. So, I left at lunch, and now I feel guilty about leaving. Oh well, I think a day will help me. I need some time to process things. And I will do a shift at the hospital tonight with my mom. I just really wish there was something I could do. I hate being helpless. Fuck, this sucks.   "
1620,3779062,"13,August,2004",2004-08-13,"   So, Friday the 13. Hmmmmm. Either something good will happen or something bad will happen. Or maybe it will be like the rest of my life and nothing at all will happen. I have rediscovered why I don't stage manage any more. I am so bored watching this show. And I would feel bad about sitting there and reading. Grrrr. Well, only 4 more. And if one more actor comes to me with a brilliant idea, I am going to have to kill them. Maybe if they knew all there lines or all there songs or didn't goof things up every night, I would listen to them. But I wonder why they are worried about other peoples blocking, but don't seem to care that they have no idea what they are doing.   "
21035,3780716,"28,June,2004",2004-06-28,"   Hola! Here I am today! Nothing to do and bored to death. I have school right now and that like takes up my day. I have to go to school because I didn't pass the Science TAKS...Boo!! Why do I have to be so dumb?! After my mom picked me up, we went to the driving place so I can sign up! Woo-Hoo...one step closer to driving! Well, everything has been so weir for me! I don't know what to do with myself! I have been so out of it...I don't even have the friends I used to! I have lost so much of my friends and I don't even know how I did that! Like I mean, I have lost touch with Krysten, Michelle, and Krista! I feel like I have lost my friends..even though I knew deep down inside Krista and Michelle didn't like me! I don't know what was up with that! It's like I went to a church where I no longer had friends. I felt so left out in everything I did! It was sad! Now, if go to church I end up going in Lytle or when I am with my dad! I miss everyone at church but like I mean, if they missed me too...they would call! I wonder what will happen with my mom and step-dad, Doug, and the whole divorce thing! I can't wait until something actually happens! Something need to happens now! I mean like, I get so tired of wondering what is going to happen! I can't stand any of my step-sisters! I mean like everything they have done has been so wrong. None of them are even the same anymore! They are all liars. Farrin is a two-faced idiot! Cassidy has a horrible attitude and Brandy is a WITCH! I wanna get away from them all! I wanna leave here. Get away forever! I hate where I am and I wish I could just go away-FAR AWAY!! But anyways- I have been pretty happy when I am able to go spend time with my brother and his gf's Family all in Lytle. I mean, it is so small over there, but I love it for some reason! I like being over there and it is just so fun! That's probaly where I will be the rest of the summer cause that's where I like to be! I wish I could move out of here! I wanna graduate and leave here! I wish I could drive! I wish I had a job! I wish I had money! My life has been screwed over because my stupid and wicked step-sisters! I need to get away! But I don't know- I have to stop whining and try to face what's happening now! I have to go for right now anyways! Bye and love you!  "
21036,3780716,"18,July,2004",2004-07-18,"   Hey...I am SOOO tired...I have to wake up so early in the morning and I am gonna have so much trouble doing that! I am gonna go to camp with my youth group at church. I will be gone until Saturday! I hope I have myself some fun! I really do because I didn't even wanna go but I told myslef the only way I would go was if Krysten went...and she is going so now I am going. I hope there is no DRAMA even though there seems to always be some! Today was a pretty boring day. Nothing too exciting. I was tired this morning because my dad had a gig last night. It was really good. I always enjoy going&nbsp;to hear him sing though. I love it! So yah-I wen tot church, then ate, then came home and them my Mesha calls (James' gf) to see if my mom and I wanted to join them for dinner at Olive Garden. So we went and the food was GOOD! I like olive Garden! I got full fast though...I was so excited cause I got to eat shrimp Mmm Mmm Mmm :o) So yuppers-we came home and I had to pack my clothes for camp. I am GONNA BE SLEEPY!!! I am gonna miss everyone though! Uh huh...k, now I have nothing to say so I will go now...luv you mucho xoxo...  "
21037,3780716,"05,July,2004",2004-07-05,"   Holla-How are you guys doing? Well, I am ok and doing better than earlier. I was miserable last night...I cried myself to sleep :o( But, I woke up late and I chilled. Naomi and Paul came over and my mom BBQed for us. We just visited which was nice! We were just talking and talking. Later they left and I was once again bored. Today went by really quick though. I was actually planning on going out today but no one was around to. So, I just stayed here and did nothing. My mom was all crying and was saying that I don't love her or something like that. I didn't know what to do. So her and I ended up having this long conversation. She is better now. I was all depressed and emotional still, so I let some tears loose. You are probaly thinking I am a cry baby...but only sometimes-haha! Really, I am not always like that! But, the good thing is that I am doing a lot better. I finally got the picture posted. I was having trouble at first, but now I have it under control. Man-I need to go to the Valley soon. I haven't seen my family in a while! I miss them too! I also miss BOBBY! I haven't seen him in a long time! The most coolest thing is that we met at church camp. We met the summer of my 8th grade year! It's been a while and we are still good friends! That's what you call a friend. He is so sweet too! HI BOBBY :o) He is going off to college soon though. So, I need to get over there so I can see him! Man-I have no idea what I will be doing tomorrow...hopefully Lucas and Naomi can come over. I wanna do something with them-but more than likely they won't come over. So yah-I am gonna end up going to bed early cause Steve went to bed and I have no one to talk to...o well, I guess I need the rest anyways! I really hope I can get better...I don't like to be sad! I WILL :o) So yuppers...I guess I should head to bed in a lil bit...night!  Love you-M U A H xoxo  "
21038,3780716,"04,July,2004",2004-07-04,"   Hi-well, today sucked badly. I mean, I went to church and I got to see everybody and all. We went out to lunch with some family friends! We went to go eat at Souper Salad. It was ok. I was not feeling good so the whole time I was all out of it because I wasn't feeling good. Then my mom and I went to Seaworld to go meet Naomi! We got there at like 3. It was HOT! But yah-we went to go see some shows or whatever. I really liked the Fireworks...they were pretty! People were shoving a lot and I wasn't feeling good, so I was REALLY annoyed. I felt like the 3rd wheel with my mom and Naomi. They weren't even talking to me, so basically I was there all alone! I wish I would have had someone there with me. I hated it so much! I wasn't feeling good and I was being ignored! Then, I decide I wanna go to Lytle cause I don't wanna be HERE...and like there were some difficulties! There is this guy that is married to Lucas' cousin. He is 20 and like supposedly he was looking at me a couple of times or whatever. I wasn't encouraging the situation, in fact-I was clueless until Mesha told James and he talked to me. From then on, I became uncomfortable. Well, long story short, he called me and James found out. He had just called to see how I was and it was wrong cause he is married but my brother doesn't like him and he got MAD. Now, when I get home from having a bad day, my brother calls to say to me that he thinks it is best that I just don't show my face in Lytle for awhile until they figure out what to do with him...and they expect me to be ok with it! YAH RIGHT!!! I am so emotional right now and I just started to cry :o( I was so sad! I feel like I have no where. I don't wanna be here and I can't be there. But I don't know what to do...it is gonna be so uncomfortable when I see him now. They said they were gonna talk to him and then that will put me on the spot. I just wish this wasn't happeneing! UGH-I hate it! So now here I am...sad! I am so tired but I don't feel good and when I don't feel good, I don't sleep! SUCKS!! Anyways-hope whoever is reading this had a great 4th! But yah-sorry this entry is so extremely boring. I had to say what was on my mind. And I think I may be in Lytle for a couple days...so if you don't hear from me, that's where I am! Well, I guess I am gonna go for right now! Bye guys and I love you! MUAH xoxo...  "
21039,3780716,"03,July,2004",2004-07-03,"   Hey...today I did not feel good at all! I ended up going to bed at like 5:30 because I was talking to Steve. We were like taking turns telling jokes or whatever. It was funny! I woke up at 11 because I was not feeling good. I had some bad pains. I didn't get to go to the funeral either because I could not walk and I felt so sick! I didn't have a lot of energy. I was so tired today that I ended up staying home all day! I watched TV and I played alot of games! I am tired of sitting at home. I am actually going to Crossroads tomorrow! It will be weird because I have not been there in SO LONG! I hope it isn't too awkward! Tomorrow, my mom and I are gonna go to Lytle and try to see if we can see my brother! I guess then after that, I am gonna go to Sea World and watch the Fireworks! Woo-Hoo! I hope I am feeling ok to go though! I hope I am atleast feeling a lot better! School is so close! I wish it wasn't! I REALLY don't wanna go back. I am not excited about going back to O'Connor! I miss Taft! I wish I was keeping touch with all my friends! I think I have lost alot of them. YEAH-My hair has a grown a little. Not a lot, but hey-I am getting there. I am so tempted to cut it! I hate my hair. It's like I dont have a stlye! UGH...suck a nut! I have not been excercising like I had been wanting to. I get so lazy! I hope I can get fit soon. I don't wanna be all fat! So yuppers-I wanna hear ""Roses"". I love that song. I don't even know why! All I know is that I really like it! Everytime it comes on, I start singing and dancing! YEAH :o) Okay then, I probaly need to get to bed early tonight since I have to wake up Early. Nighty Night...Love you...M U A H xoxo  "
21040,3780716,"02,July,2004",2004-07-02,"   Holla! Well, today was a pretty long day! Today was the last day at school...thank goodness! Now all I have to do is take the test next week...I am so scared/nervous! But-it will be all good in the end! Anywho-I was so bored today! I went to go eat at Applebee's with my mom. It was good!

I am going to that funeral tomorrow! It is gonna be so sad. I feel so bad for the family. I wanna put my pic in this thing that is Hot or not thing...it is a webiste and supposedly people vote on whether you are pretty or not. I wanna do it because I am curious as to what people will think of me...So, that's what I will do for tomorrow..I just hope a lot of people do  not think I am ugly. That will be a discouragement! My brother was mad at me because there is this guy that he doesn't like that called  me and it got into a huge deal...I started to cry cause I thought he was mad at me. I hate when he is mad at me though! I also talked to Lucas, he is so funny! He makes me laugh so much and that is always a good thing when a guy can make you laugh a lot! Hehehe :o) So yah...I am talking to this guy Steve that I met through a weird way, but man, for those of you who know about Danny a.k.a the Faggot, I found of some stuff. He is so Stupid and so is his gf! I can't believe I ever believed anything he ever said to me. What a loser! But hey-we all learn from our STUPID mistakes! Or atleast I will! Never Again! It is so hard for me to trust poele though and that is something I am gonna have to work on. I just wish people would respect me enough to not lie to me! O well-it happens I guess. I wanna meet a guy that will truly care for me and like me for who I am! I mean, I want a guy that will make me laugh, smile, make me feel important and like, I dont know- I want A COOL GUY! My wish :) Yuppers...HI STEVE-SMILE :o) Thought I would say hi! Hehe...anyways-I am getting tired though. I still have no idea what I am doing on the 4th and I wish I knew!

21041,3780716,"01,July,2004",2004-07-01,"   What-up?! Here I am bored again in my stupid apartment! With nothing to do again! My days have been so boring! I can't stand being here anymore! I can't wait until school is over. 1 MORE DAY! Thank goodness! Well, yesterday I went with Nessa to Panda's Express and then to Old Navy. I saw the cutest shorts. I had to get them and I did! They are super cute. They aren't short...they come up to my knees I think, but when you see them, they are ugly, but I guess it's when you put them on they look adorable! I like them! I dont know what I am gonna do for 4th yet! I probaly will go with Naomi! I don't want her to go alone to Sea World. I really don't wanna be with my mom! I hope I am not stuck with her either! I have no idea of what I am gonna do when this week is over. I don't know whether to go back to Lytle or to go with my dad. I still need to decide! But all I know is that I am NOT gonna be here with my mom! Definitely not! I wanna go out and fun right now! I have some cute outfits that I feel like showing off right now! But I can't do it when I am under this roof!! Haha! Anyways-I wanna see all my old friends. I miss everyone! Man-I cannot believe that Lindsay's mom died last Saturday! I mean like everyone was kinda expecting it, but wow! I mean she is really not here now! It is so sad and I am going to the funeral on Saturday! I wonder how she is taking it! I hate going to funerals because they are just so sad! But, I feel that I need to go! I was close to them and I have known them for a long itme. I think it would only be right if I went! So, yah-I got to talk to Krysten the other day. I hadn't talked to her in forever and I was just so scared that she was mad at me! Thank goodness she wasn't! I really can't stand my step sis either. I mean she is so fake! I am glad I haven't seen them. I get mad when I think about them and everything! So yuppers- I feel like going to see ""White Chicks"". I wonder if that was a good movie or not. Man-o-Man...I wanna go shopping! Haha-I always want to though, so it really isn't a big deal. I need a job so that I can get money and go get some really cute clothes! It's on the to-do list! I wanna learn to play my guitar too! That would be so exciting! Maybe I should trying doing that soon! Okay so yah-I have to go...sorry this may be boring to whoever is reading this...I promise that my life will get interesting...haha! Luv ya MUCHO!

7085,3785275,"29,June,2004",2004-06-29,"    Men are the reason all of us are here.I mean yes they made us BUT  us women usually get stuck raising those kids.SO when a man says its the mothers that make a man the way he is well thats a lie.Most women dont know how to raise a man so if the man would take care of his kids the way he should maybe we would have less GAY men and more REAL men.Dont get me wrong not all men are bad but the majority id say 80-20 are.They get the girl pregnant and say ""oh i dont want her anymore"" then leave her high and dry.Then when she slap child support on his sorry ass he wanna act a fool.Then be gettin jealous when she find a man better than him that wanna take care of his kids.But see me I just want a man to be with me and except my kids.He aint gotta take care of them because they aint his,and they shouldnt call no other man daddy but at the same time why not when they real daddy aint doin shit but hoein around and talkin shit to u about who u with.So men if u want us to raise a strong man get ur asses in the picture and HELP.Of course it takes a man to raise a man and if u aint there for ur kids u aint a man to begin with.ANd by that I mean get a job support ur kids love aint gonna buy diapers and clothes and food.Love aint gonna put a roof over they head.Yall talk shit about a woman being on welfare well if the man was doing his job we wouldnt have to be.       Then u have these sorry ass men that think its fun to put they hands on a woman and they say they love u baby that aint love.Thats  a pussy."" I love u thats why I hit you"" What the fuck is that.I know all this from experience.Its horrible and degrading to the good men out there.Then while he putting them hands on u he also out there sticking his piece in every woman that he meet bringing u home STDs and shit then try to blame u for giving it to him.HA  thats what i mean - men are no good.No matter what race men are worthless.All they good for is a quick nut and satisfying a womans needs and if u want they there to mate.Thats it then u can raise that baby alone like u gonna be doing anyway.       For the good brothas out there i mean no harm towards u but damn  show these other brothas how to treat a woman!! All well I wont say all, most women are goddesses and we deserve to be treated like queens.There are some scandolous women out there too i know a few myself but thats the ones that deserve the sorry men.What about us that treat our men like kings  we deserve the same in return but most of the time we dont get it.So fellas if yall got a good woman hold onto her and ladies if yall got a good man hold on to him.

I mean it happens and in my eyes almost ALWAYS ends in heartache,pain and misery.Who wants to feel all that.I damn sho dont.But I find myself falling again and again and enduring that pain over and over?WHY?  I ask myself that so many times but it never comes to me?Dont get me wrong it can be good and make u feel incredible and overwhelming happiness but I just wonder where is the man fa me?Is there even one out there?Im sho there is somewhere BUT will I be able to love that man?ANd if I do is he going to cause me just as much pain as the others? I guess the only real answer is just put my heart out there again and give it a shot.ANd for the meaning of love well i still dont have answer for that. "

7088,3785275,"10,August,2004",2004-08-10,    Why ask why? Good question? In this world today u pretty much have to ask that question WHY? Why is there still prejudice and racism out there.Closed minded people is one of the answers.All the answeres well we might never know.Why does love hurt when its supposed to be good? Just a simple thing that we all go thru and heartbreak unfortunatley follows it most of the time but its life.Why everytime theres a birth we have a death?

So I went to the website, took the little tour, and was tempted to start my own blog! Resisted this temptation, however. But recently read about a man named Mil Millington (yes, Mil Millington, if I'm remembering correctly) who turned his personal blog into a bestselling novel. You know, fictionalized it some. He's English. But this sounds like a freak accident. He was sitting at home one morning and Random House (or whoever) called and offered him a book deal.   Grr!!  So cannot blog til sundown every day and hope this happens. That would be nonsense.   Already the allure of a potential audience makes me giddy with questions: 1) Would people read my blog? 2) Would people like my blog? 3) Would people like me after they read my blog? 4) Would my blog be interesting to others or just clog cyberspace?   None of these questions are answerable, really, without first blogging. I myself have run across people logging their blog with gluttonous abandon, writing to all and sundry who will listen about late-night parties, skipping school, the odd romance, their day at the beach, what they had for lunch, and whatnot. And reading what an anonymous 15-year-old had for lunch is not all that interesting.   Or is it?  This is the frightening thing about the kinds of things I write, actually. When it comes right down to facts I'm not at all sure the stuff I write for fun is sellable as a memoir/novel/short form item because more often than not I am talking about what I had for lunch (if metaphorically).   And for some reason, I know people who I wouldn't want hovering around my blog hoping to read what I had for lunch.  Is blogging for me? For all my apparent choice-driven inconsistencies, it's still tempting.  LA   "
21187,3792732,"30,June,2004",2004-06-30,"   Hello all!  My sister Nancy and I went to a bath house recently. It's a fully operational bath house in Hot Springs, Arkansas, a town famous for it's natural hot springs. In the early twentieth century the Hot Springs bath houses were flocked to for the ""curative"" powers of the naturally hot water. I visited Buckstaff, which is the last original bath house still operating today on bath house row. At least 4 women attendants saw me completely naked from all angles. I had to wear a thin white sheet between bathing stations that was soaking wet most of the time.   I sat in 100 degree water in a huge porcelain tub, scummy looking liquid soap foaming from my outboard-motor whirlpool and crusting around skin that broke the surface of the water. (This after being loofah-scrubbed by a plain girl named Tonya, four inches of water in my tub while she adjusted dials and fixed temperature, water level rising up the porcelain. We accidentally made eye contact as she instructed me to lay back, loofah scratching at my knees, my face undoubtedly flickering between discomfort (sandpaper loofah) and embarrassment (being completely naked). Tonya leaves and I'm there 25 minutes, feeling my muscles relax and I try not to imagine the thousands of women, many seeking cures from diseases with the hot springs, who have bathed in this tub since 1917.  I sat in a mildly humiliating sitz bath cubicle (Me: ""What is this?"" Tonya: ""A sitz bath. You put your bottom in it."" It's like sitting in a sink.) facing the bustling baths unshielded by a curtain, my front covered only by a stretched-looking hand towel.   I sat in one of those sweatboxes (Me, on approach: ""It's so hot!"" Tonya, ushering me inside: ""Yes it is, it's good for you."")--metal with a hole cut out for your head, with steam billowing inside, sweat gushing (yes, gushing!) from every pore neck-down--that got so hot inside I questioned both my sanity and my ability to stay conscious. Sweat sluiced down my back, my front, my sides, the back of my knees, and my hands got so hot I had to press them between my legs. I had to slouch down so the metal box could settle comfortably around my shoulders without my skin touching hot metal. Tonya wrapped my sheet around the neck opening, and I lay my flaming face against the amazingly cool cotton and waited for release.  I lay on a plastic-covered slab of foam with hot towels wrapped around my knees and shoulders (Me: ""Those towels are so hot!"" Tonya: ""Yes, they are."") and I could feel the burned skin sloughing from my legs, but I look later and they are intact. Tonya came at my face with a towel, which I tried to rebuff, but before I could it touched down and I realized it was blessedly icy.   I was ushered by a new lady, name unknown, to the needle shower. ""See if that's too hot,"" she says. I stick my hand in. ""It's too hot!"" I say. We slide down to the other end of the concourse, and I am presented to the other shower, which is cool. I see Nancy, wilty in a chair, looking slightly flushed in her white sheet.   ""I've bypassed all the other things! I got too hot!"" She shouts to be heard over the din of running water.   I look at her in surprise. ""No sitz bath?! No sweatbox?!"" I am flabbergasted.   ""What's a sitz bath?"" she asks.   ""That sink thing over there!"" I point it out.   ""No,"" she says, ""no sitz bath. You actually got in a sweatbox? It's too hot!""  I go back to have my massage. I lay in a small cool room with an overhead fan and am rubbed with hot lotion by yet another lady whose name I don't remember. This is the best part of the day. I decide to forego the bath next time and just get a massage.  After, N and I are faint from hunger and can only manage to drag ourselves across the street where we end up at some odd low-rent blues lounge. The outside looks respectable, like a place with character; we get inside and after a few moments decide it's not the kind of place you want to use the bathroom. It's almost deserted at 4.00 pm. Non-smoking is a joke, as the sunken velvet-covered (maybe velour) seats soak up everything. It's dim, the illumination coming almost solely from the deepset windows, and the walls are covered in horseracing posters. The menu has a racetrack theme. It's a squirrelly combo of racing and hard-drinking nightlife, the former infusing the atmosphere with cheap chain-store kitsch and the latter adding trailers, trash, and tattoos. But at least it has air conditioning. It's about 90 degrees outside and I worked up a sweat just crossing the street, ruining whatever cleanliness my bathing experience had generated.   Once seated, we look at each other and debate, but decide on staying. We don't have the energy to find somewhere else. I order cold roast beef and she tries the club with a side of onion rings.  She grudgingly gives one to me and they turn out to be the best onion rings I have ever had in my entire life. My fries are mediocre. The white bread on my roast sticks in my teeth and since I've touched my straw with lotion-soaked hands I'm wary of my water with lemon.  We manage to stroll the street after and have ice cream cones and coffee. Nancy gets two whistles from passersby, one from a truck full of redneck guys and the other from a semi-homeless-crazy-looking guy on a bike. On the way home N puts Garrison Keillor on the radio while she drives, and we float along smoothly, and I feel exhausted, and I doze.  LA   "
21188,3792732,"30,June,2004",2004-06-30,"   Hi.  I know a guy who does ventriloquism. You know, talking with a dummy and pretending the two of you are having a real conversation. The guy's name is Robby and the dummy's name is Raymond. I know Robby from work and Raymond from one of Robby's (what to call these?) performances. Robby is a children's speaker and uses Raymond as a teaching tool for the kids, which is good. Most kids like the whole ventriloquism thing, I think.  Except me. As a kid I didn't like watching the dummy half of a ventriloquism act talk or move. Ventriloquism makes me feel squirmy.   What's more, there is a promotional poster of Robby and Raymond in my workspace! It was there when I started working and for some odd reason I don't feel I have the authority to take it down. I have an open workspace, I guess is the thing. It's just a head shot of both, and from the way they are positioned Raymond appears to be sitting on Robby's lap. Raymond (the part of him I can see) is wearing a white buttondown, tie, and sweatervest. I can feel Raymond watching me a I type this (yes, I know, from work), round face and bulbous nose above his crisp collar. It's one of those snaps where the eyes follow you. And strangely there is  yet another identical poster across the room!     I know this sweatervest is green because Raymond was wearing exactly the same outfit when I saw him in person at Robby's talk. Raymond looks like Goober from the Andy Griffith Show. Goober dressed in white buttondown, tie, dark green sweatervest, grey flannel trousers, white socks, and black and white oxford saddle shoes. I wonder if Raymond has more than one outfit, but I don't dare ask Robby. It might seem like I'm more than normally interested.   I had met Robby a couple of times through the course of my work, and before I saw him with Raymond he was a normal guy. Outgoing, friendly, professional. But now that I've seen Raymond, every time Robby speaks I hear Raymond's voice in the background saying the exact same thing on a 0.5 second delay. It's like wearing headphones while each speaker intones the same thing in a different voice into either ear. Even the casual ""Hi, how are you?"" has Raymond's voice in eerie overlay.  The grandfather of a good friend died last week and his funeral was on Saturday. I didn't know this until I arrived, but Robby knew the guy. I spotted him from across the room as I walked into the church sanctuary, but there wasn't time to say hello. Then the service started.   And Robby gave the eulogy.   And so did Raymond.    LA   "
21189,3792732,"01,July,2004",2004-07-01,"   Hey.  8|   This is me. My eyeballs are glazed over and I'm so bored I'm expressionless.  I'm glad to have somewhere to go every day, but I wish I were busier.   I'm sooooooooo sleepy.  3|  This is me sleeping at my desk. I could go to sleep here at the computer right now. Even though it's a bit chilly in here.  See? I can close my eyes and type at the same time, and in a few minutes I'll just stop typing, slowly drift off, the clatter of the keys diminishing, each stroke becoming laborious, heavy, sluggish, sleeeeepy.  Haven't had any caffeine today. Maybe this is the thing. But I need to wean myself off caffeine anyway.   It's way too easy to close my eyes at my desk. When did this become acceptable????   So it alternates (in five-second incriments):   8| 3| 8| 3|   Then the phone rings, and   8|   LA   "
21190,3792732,"02,July,2004",2004-07-02,"   Hello all!  So Nancy and I are sitting in the dim theater waiting for Spider-Man to start. It's opening day, crowded. We manage to find seats halfway up the gallery, way over on the right, three seats from the wall. We juggle our jumbo Sprite (Nancy has this late-night caffeine adversion, late night being after 5 pm) and large popcorn (N: ""It's 50 cents cheaper if you buy a bigger combo!"") and plain M&Ms. I find going to the movies with Nancy to be somewhat economical, as she's got no qualms sharing a drink or a snack. It works well for both of us.   The couple in the row in front of us appear to be on a first date. I say this because that's how they looked to me. You don't often overhear people announcing things like that. They are youngish, but not teenagers. Early twenties? She's a mildly attractive blond in bright lipstick and red top, and he's a mildy attractive guy with dark office-worker hair and one of those three-button knit pullovers with a solid-color collar and striped body. Some muted earth tones.   His hair is thick and ends abruptly in the back as if the hairdresser failed to taper but instead mowed a line straight across his neck with clippers. Disconcerting, but okay then. They smile a lot into each other's faces with that I'm-trying-to-impress-you-but-am-pretending-not-to-try-because-not-to-pretend-would-be-too-obvious-but-this-is-not-(although-this-maybe-kind-of-is) kind of way. Brief snatches of their conversation drift upwards and backwards towards me.   He's saying, ""You didn't know that about me? But yes! And of course I love my Chillow...""  I poke Nancy in the elbow. ""Chillow!"" I hiss, trying to be covert. I gesture discreetly with the popcorn tub. ""That guy has a Chillow!""  There's a look of incredulity on Nancy's face. She thinks  urlLink Chillows  are crazy, and is no doubt shocked to find that someone else owns one. ""Oh my gosh! There's two of you!""  I feel an instant rush of goodwill and commonality towards him, and am suddenly able to forgive his haircut. I think the Chillow is a great invention. I purchased one for my mom for Mother's Day, but have since borrowed it and use it shamelessly.   ""And here's something else you don't know!"" he announces. Oh my. He's one of those guys who think it appropriate behavior to begin spouting lists of facts or ask you stupid job-interview-like open-ended questions while on a date instead of having a normal, flowing conversation.   ""And--the backseat--my car--."" Drat! He's mumbling. ""I have this doll that--."" I hear that loud and clear.   I poke Nancy again. She is now eating the top butterd layer of popcorn out of our tub. ""That guy has a doll!"" I sqeak at her, this time cocking my head in his direction.   Nancy pauses, hand poised above the popcorn, fingers glistening with butter, eyes hard and wary. ""Yeah, that's not working for me.""  ""And the circus!"" we hear him exclaim with joy. Nancy and I look at each other, eyes wide with horror that anyone 1) actually likes the circus and 2) announces that type of thing on a date.   ""Look, she's in shock,"" I whisper, meaning his date. The blond's eyes have begun to glaze a little and her smile is on automatic.  All feelings of warmth and solidarity I feel over the discovery of another Chillow-user evaporate. Nancy fluffs the popcorn and angles it in my direction. I eat a few pieces and watch the crowd, wondering how many more bad first dates are going on. The lights begin to fade and the chatter of the crowd increases in anticipation. Applause breaks out and ripples across the gallery as the screen in front of us flares with light, and we watch.  LA   "
21191,3792732,"14,July,2004",2004-07-14,"   I'm in my car, pulling up to the drive-thru at McDonald's (yeah, yeah), sliding into the narrow isle beside the building. I can see several cars in front of me disappear round the side of the building--the line begins to wrap around the corner. I'm sliding into place, slowing, when a white SUV darts through the side of the parking lot--ignoring the narrow isle obviously marked Drive-Thru--and rolls to a stop ""in line"" moments before I do. Our front bumpers meet at a right angle, his gas-guzzler lining up perfectly behind the car in front of us, my car perfectly balanced on the cusp of the curve of the designated drive-thru isle curling around the building.   He is not making any eye contact. He is lighting up a cigarette. He is rolling down his window in anticipation of ordering. The nerve! He lets off the brake and rolls forward, bringing his front tires in front of my bumper. I now have a great view as he flicks ash and adjusts his glasses and looks hard-edged and defiant.  The line moves forward and he pulls up, but not far enough to let me get around the corner. His SUV now blends seamlessly in line, filling in the corner slot. We wait. I contemplate revenge, but can think of nothing satisfying yet inconsequential to me. Instead I try to transfigure those huffy feelings of indignation into smug self-satisfaction. I have done a kind deed. I have let someone take my place in line. I have....  In my self-deluding reverie I have not noticed the gap between our cars widen. Suddenly, out of my peripheral vision, I see a flash of green careening towards me. I snap to in time to see a green SUV squeal to a halt in front of me, squirming its front quarter into the small gap between me and the white SUV. There is a woman in the car. A woman on a cell phone.  Something inside me snaps, setting off an internal dialogue between me and my evil alter ego.   Evil: HONK!! HONK LOUDLY!! Me: (Gasp of uncertainty.) No! Evil: HONK!! Me: No! (I am angst-ridden.)  Evil: HONK!! Me: No! (But I think this feebly.)  Evil: HONK THE HORN!! Me: Maybe I can. Maybe I should. She certainly deserves it.  My hand hovers over the horn.   Evil: Yes! Just honk the horn! Me: Can I really? Evil: !!!!  Evil is speechless with frenzied desire to honk the horn.   Okay! I'm going to honk the horn! I feel empowered and justified and completely right whilst at the same time seething with revenge. My hand moves to honk, and then something stops me.   Time. It's been too long. I've missed that special window of opportunity. I instantly know that if I honk now it will mean nothing. It will not be the spontaneous and deserved response to an injustice against me; it will be a pathetic, aborted attempt at self-assertion that will look foolish. Or look like a joke. It will have the classic tell-joke-then-take-comic-beat-then-tell-punchline rhythm. Completely inappropriate for revenge purposes.  Suddenly it all seems like too much. I break past every sanity barrier and scream out into my windshield in a high, shrieking voice, ""YOU WILL GET YOUR COMEUPPANCE!!!""  And instantly feel better.   My window isn't rolled down, and hers isn't either, so I doubt she hears me, but that doesn't seem important.   The line moves forward, and she jerks around the corner in starts and stops, like she is pressing on both the gas pedal and the brake at once. She gives her order. The line moves. I give my order.   We are now around the bend and I see the white SUV move up to take his place alongside the hand-out window. There is now a large gap between the white SUV and the green SUV. I see the brake lights of the green SUV disappear, and I hear a rumble in front of me. Suddenly, the green SUV lurches forward with startling intensity. And rear-ends the white SUV.   Immediately, the chain-smoker in glasses jumps out of the white SUV and postures with angry shock next to his rear bumper. He gestures with his cigarette to unseeable damages, smoke billowing from angry nostrils. I see the lady in the green SUV lean out of her window. She says something, but I cannot hear what. It obviously angers white SUV because he suddenly becomes dramatic, bouncing back and forth between her window and his bumper, gesticulating with his cigarette, head jerking back and forth on his neck, and saying in a raised voice, ""Watch where you're going you bitch, you....""   I am immediately in awe at the inner workings of the universe. I feel one twinge of guilt, and then it disappears.   He spews more angry obscenities, jumps back into his vehicle, grabs his food from the hands of the McDonald's employee hanging out the drive-thru window, gets change, then drives off. The green SUV pulls forward to receive her food. It's my turn. When I get to the window the McDonald's folks are still shaking their heads and looking mildly shocked. I, on the other hand, am enjoying cosmic justice.     LA   "
21192,3792732,"08,August,2004",2004-08-08,"   Iâ€™m sitting here fully expecting prose to burst from my fingertips at any moment. Thatâ€™s the life of a writer. Long moments of quiet solitude filled with the dance of language and the feeling that everything you write will be nuanced and meaningful.  Instead I find myself waiting for inspiration, pondering the backs of my hands as they linger mournfully over the keyboard, and imagining myself writing, writing like a champ. Instead I find myself writing long, drawn out sentences of ungrammatical proportions, like Garrison Keillor, my new writer of envy. Only his sentences are grammatical and nuanced and meaningful and since they are so long on top of everything take on monumental importance and only show the beauty of the craft, if done right.  I think email has ruined me. Nothing comes now as easily as sitting in front of the Compose screen in my Hotmail account and pouring out my thoughts and feelings to loved ones. They appreciate all and criticize nothing. Unlike the rest of the world, they await my prose with an eager, open mind. Iâ€™ve come to realize a receptive audience is everything.  I havenâ€™t got one of thoseâ€”a receptive audience. Not even a hostile audience. Iâ€™m what they call unpublished. Well, okay, technically not. Technically I have three published pieces. I have sold one nonfiction essay to a website a friend works at. However, even though they have purchased my essay, it has not yet been posted on the website. I find it embarrassing now to have told friends and loved ones that I was being published on the web only to have my so-called debut delayed indefinitely. The second essay is also nonfiction, also published through a friend in a newsletter. And thereâ€™s my masterâ€™s thesis (fulfilling a degree in writing, no less) and my name is on the copyright page, but only two copies have gone into distribution, and both of those to the school I graduated from.  Iâ€™ve not gotten much further. But something will happen. I'm working (thinking) on it.  Without this internal, self-investment-type praise, no writer would ever publish.   "
21193,3792732,"09,August,2004",2004-08-09,"   I met Garrison Keillor very briefly at a recent literary event. After a one-hour presentation, an informal book signing was staged in the lobby of a downtown auditorium. I went with Nancy (she's also a Garrison Keillor fan) and I was a little star struck, Iâ€™m afraid. We chatted for approximately three minutesâ€”an eternity in the book-signing lineâ€”as he inscribed my hardback copy of  Love Me , his latest book. Hereâ€™s what the inscription says: Leigh Ann, love and oranges, garrison Keillor, and then the date. Lowercase ""g"" and everything! I wonder now if he writes frequent emails (the nature of email being somewhat lax on capitalization).  Afterwards on the steps outside the building I spend several minutes trying to decipher that word that looked suspiciously like â€œoranges.â€ For some reason it seemed bad form to open the book and read what had written right in front of him. It must be some quality of the celebrity that made me think that Garrison Keillor might inscribe something of great importance on my personal copy of his novel, or impart some great wisdom during our 3 minute exchange. I left feeling horribly clichÃ©.  This is a paraphrased transcript recounted to the best of my recollection.  Me: Hello! (We shake hands.) It's nice to meet you.  GK: Nice to meet you. (He takes my book and opens the cover).  Me: My name is Leigh Ann.  GK: Let me guess. (He spells out loud): L-e, capital A-n-n.  Me: No, I'm L-e-i-g-h, capital A-n-n.  GK: A high-rent Leigh Ann.  Me: Yes, I suppose so.  GK: Are you from around here?  Me: Yes, I grew up in Arkansas.  GK: So what do you do?  Me: Um, actually, I'm looking for work. (At this point I desperately don't want Garrison Keillor to know I can't get a job as a writer.)  GK: As what?  Me: Well, as a writer, coincidentally.  GK: Oh really! You'll have to move away from here to do that!  Me: Yes--I've heard NY. What would you recommend?  GK: I wouldn't recommend NY unless you have some contacts there already. I wouldn't just pick up and go. You need some contacts.  Me: Hmm. Okay.  GK: What kind of writing job are you looking for?  Me: I'm open to all possibilities. I just graduated with my master's degree.  GK: In what?  Me: In writing. (At this point GK looks up from my book--he's still writing on it--and we make sudden eye contact. He lookes mildly surprised, mildly assessing, and later Nancy says he seems impressed.)  GK: Is it an MFA?  Me: No, it's an MA in professional and technical. I'm trying to stay away from the technical and concentrate on professional.  GK: No, you don't want to do technical!  Me: I was teaching freshman composition--  GK: Well, maybe your parents could support you for a month or two? (He hands my book back.)  Me: Hmm, well, maybe. (I nod). That is a possibility.  GK: Or you could just have a nervous breakdown.  Me: Yeah, there you go. I could just have one of those. (I try to keep this as lighthearted as possible by my tone.)  GK: You have to write every day. Every day. And observe things. You have to watch, and to listen. And write every day.  Me: (Nodding.) Um hmmm.  GK: If only I could just hit you on the right spot, right on the side of your head (he gestures), knock something loose....  Me: (Smiling.) If only....  (A pause where we just look at each other.)  Me: Well, it was nice meeting you.  GK: Bye.  ---------End Transcript---------  I blacked out around the time he was talking about my parents supporting me, so I couldn't figure out if he was talking about supporting me in NY or elsewhere. I think it was the combination of GK telling me not to go to NY and the alternate track in my head that was running with all the things that I *should* have said that distracted me for that millisecond. I should have asked about what he meant by contacts.  It's all so horribly clichÃ©! The unknown/unpublished asking advice from the great author. At a book signing of all places! As Nancy and I walked up the steps to the auditorium before the program started (he did a presentation before the signing) I overheard one woman say to another, ""I've been taking a creative writing course..."" and it made me sick. Everyone in that room probably took a creative writing course in their spare time! Everyone thinks they can be a writer! In the bigger picture I'm no different from 100,000,000 other unknown writers in the universe, all of us asking Garrison Keillor how to become a writer.   "

I was tucked up in bed UNDER A BLANKET delerious with fever, aches and pains with that stupid flu going around!.. oh yes so happy.. and so happy to be back at work on Monday having used my weekend so fruitfully!!..   "
21853,3805349,"30,June,2004",2004-06-30,"   I am in Des Moines right now. I have been here at my sister's apartment for about a week now. I have been having a lot of fun. One major downfall though is that I have had sunburn on my shoulders. I couldn't move very much without feeling pain. The burning went away and now it's all pealing. My skin is dry so when my shirt gets moved around it hurts for a bit. Sleeping is a pain. I guess I am somewhat out of order.  I miss some stuff about home. I love to play games and I am a big fan of the  urlLink Warp Pipe Project.  I left my Gamecube and Broadband Adapter at my house. If I come back this summer I will be bringing that along with Mario Kart: Double Dash!! because my sister has cable and I will be able to get a good game going. We don't have cable available in our area yet. MediaCom has it available in the city but we have our house in the country so we have to resort to low-grade DSL. It does the job, I guess.  I am going home later today. In a way it sucks but really, it isn't that bad. I was on a trip in Washington DC for a week. Then I came back home for three days and then came down here for a week. I haven't seen much of home.  Well, I don't have much more to say! I just want to emphasize how cool  urlLink Warp Pipe  is and how everyone should look at  urlLink Warp Pipe  instead of nasty XLink. The  urlLink Warp Pipe Revolution  is near and you should check out  urlLink the Warp Pipe Forums  to find a download of Test Builds of the Megaton, also known as  urlLink Warp Pipe v0.4.  "
21854,3805349,"30,June,2004",2004-06-30,"   This is my first entry in the Undies Drawer. I should start out by telling you a little bit about myself.   I am a 14 year old male who enjoys computers, football, games, and lots of music as well as movies. I like hanging out with my friends and family. I play guitar and am working on learning C++. I am interested in persueing a career in the field of software engineering.  "
21855,3805349,"06,July,2004",2004-07-06,"   I'm back in Des Moines at my sister's apartment. They have cable internet so I was able to play a nice game of Mario Kart with Chad, the project manager of  urlLink Warp Pipe Technologies , the best frickin' thing on this planet, at around 1/2 speed. It was the fastest game I've played.  We went to an animal adoption thing and adopted a dog. It was stray so we got to name it. I suggested Meat or Bone but everyone else said that Maddy was better.  My brother in law designed a tattoo for me. I can't get it put on but it looks cool. It's a Japanese character, but we don't exactly know what it means. I thought that a tattoo with ""GONZO III"" on it and then some Japanese writing under or after it would be cool.  "
21856,3805349,"01,July,2004",2004-07-01,"   Well, this morning I woke up at around 7:30 to head home. It had been a great night. My sisters and I went out around town and drove up to fast-food places. We'd park up by the person who give you your food and we'd blast Micheal Jackson's ""Beat It"". I don't like MJ, personally. He's quite creapy. That was pretty fun.  We got back to the apartment at around 12:30 and watched ""50 First Dates"" and fell asleep. I was on the floor of course. No complaints though.  We got back at around 11:15, just in time for me to shower and get ready for my dentist apointment. I had no cavities, which proves that it was a waste to come all of the way back home for a measly dentist appointment.  I am running out of things to keep me entertained. I should go upstairs and check whats going on.  Peace out.  "
21857,3805349,"03,August,2004",2004-08-03,"   It's been a while since I've updated. I guess I'll do it now.  Well, last night I started working on the graphics for my site. I have the table made but the problem is that I have a large banner at the top so the table is offset. I have to cut the image up so I can make everything fit nicely. I'm going to start doing that really soon.  I forgot how much fun web design can be.  I haven't had any websites since those that I made when I was younger. There was one for 4x4 Evolution, an offroading game that I used to play, and one for video games in general that my friend and I tried to set up. They all have failed. This one probably will too.  One thing that I'm doing differently, though, is I'm setting everything up, getting some content, and then I may buy a domain and a hosting plan from Dreamhost.  I have chosen Dreamhost because Chad Paulson, the Project Manager of the  urlLink Warp Pipe Project  had possitive feedback. There is also a affiliate program where you can earn $65 for each referral you get. If this is actually true, I figured it was an opportunity to get a domain and a good hosting plan, while at the same time, support the Warp Pipe Project, and all their great efforts.  Well, I'll let you know if I ever buy a domain.  "

Calypso Joe's of Vestavia  wow. my sticker is officially on a girl's VW car. how cool is that? so is she considered my first fan? tonight's gig was nice, but i was strangely calm... or was it lazy? the songs lacked the energy i usually put forth... who knows. maybe i was too comfortable. but the venue was nice... it was outdoors and you couldn't ask for a more beautiful night.   22nd Street Jazz Cafe  i am exhausted. i didn't get home til 1:30am from last night's gig, and had to be at work at 6am. blech. i feel like poo. thank god today is friday. i'll have the weekend to recoop. last night went really well... i met an  amazing  guitarist, eddie warren ( urlLink www.eddiewarren.com ). it's rare that you're in the presence of an actual phenomenon. i sat there, jaw on the floor, during his entire set. jesus christ, i've never heard anyone play the guitar quite like him. if there was ever any one person who is  one  with a guitar, it would be him. he approached me after i stepped off the stage and handed me his CD. ""i was wondering if you'd be interested in collaborating with me...""

But it was hard not to feel overwhelmed. There is so much to think about, so many different routes to take, to decide on, to choose from, as an independent artist. It was overwhelming, hard not to feel lost in a sea of hopefuls. But invigorating to know there are so many options out there.

(or rather, 'spinning silver' - is that what one would call it? since we're in the digital age?) both were so kind and hospitable, and seemed eager to start working. having people who are passionately involved in the same creative product is just... god. it's such a humbling and awe-inspiring feeling. i am just so thankful. so thankful. it really makes me wonder, why? why would anyone want to work with me? it's amazing. it's the word, amazing. and i can't can't can't wait.

There's many things that I like is also what he likes. It is so surprising ...a person mirroring you....:) unspoken understanding, no words to say, no way to express it, just feeling and feeling..it is soo peaceful being..with him..:)  I cant describe him because it is something I feel within..  An amazing honesty, a true understanding, a pure feeling. I really love him. he is gone from my life. If you can't touch it, you can't feel it, it is GONE. And probably it is better living with our memories..   If I could ask, I would ask for him to be mine. He has never hurt me, not a word..:) He has never say goodbye to me..and I don't want to say it too because he will took my heart away with him.  I will always remember his eyes, his voice, he's singing, he's dancing..everything of him..the sun and the tiger..his angels...:)  mi amor, te quiero..muchos..muchos.. "

Better or worse still nothing's stay.   Love is the best gift from god. How can you ever know the person you laid your eyes that moment changed the way you feel about life, the way you see the world and how strange it will turn your life upside down. It is still a miracle..hmmmm..:)  The first time you knew you are in love, with those pain in your stomach. Churning and warming. And the need to just hearing his voice, to just feel him near you, to just knew he is the person that you love. To get up in the morning to know that you long for his smile and to just think of him as the last thing before you close your eyes every night.You would not asked for more..:)  But then, to love someone is to not hurting the person but at the same time you are just a tiny human, who's so fragile and too vulnerable. To just possibly wanted to ask from god to watch over him all the time and not letting any harm ever touch him. It is wearing every emotions you had down.

11404,3813860,"29,July,2004",2004-07-29,"   So over the past few months, if you had walked past the Sears on Madison and State, like I do every day on my way to work, if you were paying attention, you would have noticed that the mannequins were wearing  swimsuits  and  penny loafers . Actually, they weren't  wearing  penny loafers, their feet were molded into likenesses of penny loafers. Way to go Sears marketing geniuses. Now&nbsp; I know why nobody wants to shop at your crappy store. I guess they were too cheap to buy mannequins with bare feet, for just one season. They thought nobody would notice, but HA! I notice everything. At least the penny loafers fit in for fall. NOT! Because now they have mannequins wearing  pajamas  and  bath robes  with their penny loafers. Maybe one day the idiots at Sears will be gazing out of their window at the Gap across the street, and realize that they could save money  and  be&nbsp;less ridiculous&nbsp;by getting rid of their lame ass penny loafer mannequins and hanging the clothes on body-shaped peices of plastic with no heads/arms/legs. Those things probably cost like $5  and  they don't piss people off who have to look at them every day. And come on, these mannequins don't have hair or facial features, but they are wearing  penny loafers ? That's some stupid ass shit.   Yes, I know I am crazy.   "
11405,3813860,"21,July,2004",2004-07-21,"   So today I left for work like 30 minutes later than I normally do, yet I still got to work on time. And I don't usually show up 30 minutes early or anything. I'm not sure how that worked out. I think I have discovered my secret super&nbsp;power: The ability to always be on time. Because now that I think about it, I don't think I have ever been late to anything in my entire life. In fact, I bet I could leave for work at 9:30, and still get here by 9:00. That's why it's a super power. I mean, it's not as cool as being able to fly, or go invisible, but still.   "
11406,3813860,"14,July,2004",2004-07-14,"   Say you are eating cherries and most of them aren't very good. They are too ripe or not ripe enough, whatever. So you are finishing the handful of not so good cherries that you grabbed, and the very last cherry is absolutely delicious. It's nice and dark red, and firm yet juicy, overall a very good cherry. So then you go back to the fridge, get another handful of cherries, and unfortunately, again, most of these aren't very good. Here's the weird thing: If all the cherries had been good, you would have stopped after the first handful. It is the hunt for the elusive good cherry that causes you to keep going back to the fridge. It's like you have this need to eat 10 good cherries, and you have to eat 10 damn it, regardless of if they are the first 10, or if it's 10 good cherries out of 100! You might think this has never happened to you, but it has, you just never noticed it before. Watch.  mmm, cherries are good.   "
11407,3813860,"10,July,2004",2004-07-10,"   I saw Fahrenheit 9/11 last night, and, to my surprise, really didn't like the movie. I was disappointed that the movie really didn't offer any information that I already did not know. I was also surprised at some of the things that were said. For example, Michael Moore chastised Bush for not sending more troops into afghanistan, and more aggressively pursuing Osama bin Laden. However Michael Moore has previously stated that bin Laden should be presumed innocent until proven guilty, and that our actions in Afganistan were thus unjustified. I was also surprised that he spent so much time speaking about bin Laden's family, their contacts with the Bush family, and their flight from the country after 9/11. I was under the impression that the bin Laden family disapproved of Osama, and had cut off contact with him long ago. I would be willing to accept that the media had misled us (as they often do), and that my impression was incorrect, but Moore did not offer evidence to that effect.   I guess I feel like Moore would say  anything , even things that he doesn't quite agree with, or that he knows might not be representing completely accurately, to make his point. And if I was angry with Bush for lying to the American public to further his own agenda, than I can't accept similar behavior from Moore, even if I agree with that agenda.   so I pretty much think that if I, someone who STRONGLY disapproves of the president, and the war, was so unconvinced by this movie, then the chances of someone who intended to vote for Bush before seeing the movie will probably not be swayed. But who knows.    I guess that the average American is more likely to see this movie than to go out and read a whole book, but I would reccommend the book ""Dreaming War"" by Gore Vidal. Vidal makes many of the same points as Moore, in what I felt was a more intelligent manner. The fact that I'd read this book before seeing the movie did not help me to enjoy the movie more. I'm sure the movie would have been much more moving to someone who had not heard some of the shocking points that Moore makes. So I can admit that the movie did have that value. And I also admit that I found several of the scenes moving. I was just disappointed that the movie wasn't all I had hoped for.  I haven't talked to too many people about this yet. I've been reading reviews, and it seems like EVERYONE likes this movie. I'm curious whether any other democrats didn't like the movie. Maybe I am just weird.   "

24935,3816360,"16,July,2004",2004-07-16,"   In the previous post I mentioned a parallel in the wording of Genesis 3:16 and Genesis 4:7.  I am now including, what I thought to be an interesting expounder on the subject.  Let's look at Genesis 3:16. Adam and Eve have both sinned against God. They have distrusted his goodness and turned away from him to depend on their own wisdom for how to be happy. So they rejected His word and they ate the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. God calls them to account and now describes to them what the curse will be on human life because of sin. In Genesis 3:16 God says to the woman, ""I will greatly multiply your pain in childbearing; in pain you shall bring forth children, and your desire shall be for your husband, and he shall rule over you.""   This is a description of the curse. It is a description of misery, not a model for marriage. This is the way it's going to be in history where sin has the upper hand. But what is really being said here? What is the nature of this ruined relationship after sin?   The key comes from recognizing the connection between the last words of this verse (3:16b) and the last words of Genesis 4:7. Here God is warning Cain about his resentment and anger against Abel. God tells him that sin is about to get the upper hand in his life. Notice at the end of the verse 7: ""Sin is crouching at the door; its desire is for you, but you must master it (literally: you shall rule over it).""   The parallel here between 3:16 and 4:7 is amazingly close. The words are virtually the same in Hebrew, but you can see this in the English as well. In 3:16 God says to the woman, ""Your desire is for your husband, and he shall rule over you."" In 4:7 God says to Cain, ""Sin's desire is for you, and you shall rule over it.""   Now the reason this is important to see is that it shows us more clearly what is meant by ""desire."" When 4:7 says that sin is crouching at the door of Cain's heart (like a lion, Genesis 49:9) and that it's desire is for him, it means that sin wants to overpower him. It wants to defeat him and subdue him and make him the slave of sin.   Now when we go back to 3:16 we should probably see the same meaning in the sinful desire of woman. When it says, ""Your desire shall be for your husband,"" it means that when sin has the upper hand in woman she will desire to overpower or subdue or exploit man. And when sin has the upper hand in man he will respond in like manner and with his strength subdue her, or rule over her.   So what is really described in the curse of 3:16 is the ugly conflict between the male and female that has marked so much of human history. Maleness as God created it has been depraved and corrupted by sin. Femaleness as God created it has been depraved and corrupted by sin. The essence of sin is self-reliance and self-exaltation. First in rebellion against God, and then in exploitation of each other.   So the essence of corrupted maleness is the self-aggrandizing effort to subdue and control and exploit women for its own private desires. And the essence of corrupted femaleness is the self-aggrandizing effort to subdue and control and exploit men for its own private desires. And the difference is found mainly in the different weaknesses that we can exploit in one another.   As a rule men have more brute strength than women and so they can rape and abuse and threaten and sit around and snap their finger. It's fashionable to say those sorts of things today. But it's just as true that women are sinners. We are in God's image male and female; and we are depraved, male and female. Women may not have as much brute strength as men but she knows ways to subdue him. She can very often run circles around him with her words and where her words fail she knows the weakness of his lust.   If you have any doubts about the power of sinful woman to control sinful man just reflect for a moment on the number one marketing force in the world â€” the female body. She can sell anything because she knows the universal weakness of man and how to control him with it. The exploitation of women by sinful men is conspicuous because it is often harsh and violent. But a moment's reflection will show you that the exploitation of men by sinful women is just as pervasive in our society. The difference is that our sinful society sanctions the one perversity and not the other. (There are societies that do just the opposite.)

24936,3816360,"14,July,2004",2004-07-14,"   Make sure you read Josh's comment to Mary Magdalene.  I gotta say I had to read it like five times to understand what he was saying because I was just so blown away that Josh was quoting the bible.  I felt it necessary to respond as I felt there was a misunderstanding and I just love to talk about all things relating to God.  I must warn the readers that I have herein written things that are different and some contradictory to Josh's comments.  One should not attempt to do so without fully realizing that Josh loves to argue, moreso than I, if you can believe it, he is also damn good (get this he's been writing and doing mock trials for years) at it and usually wins.  In light of that fact consider me reckless for posting this or consider me wanting to be verbally spanked, but since I do so love the sport I often find myself voicing a differing or opposing viewpoint.  I would like to clarify that I don't now nor did I at the time of the posting of the Mary Magdalene piece believe the idea of Mary Magdalene being Jesus' wife would be a strike against women or her credibility.  To make clear my belief on the matter is that you cannot prove either she was or was not as there just isn't much written about her.  It is greatly controversial, as it is a commonly held belief that Jesus had no need to gratify himself sexually so he would not have married.  In my opinion it is neither here nor there, because his marriage would not have been a sin and according to Hebrews 4:15 (For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but we have one who was tempted in every way, just as we are yet was without sin.) he was made in the flesh so that he could understand our weaknesses.  I wouldn't say that the desire for marital sex is a weakness, but even if you assume it to be so, it makes sense for Jesus to have experienced it.  On the other hand, he was a very busy traveling man who may not have had time for a wife.  I was trying to make a point of the irony in saying that the assumptions made on the means of her wealth are presuming and not based on much evidence and then presuming that she was Jesus' wife.  Mary is assumed to be a prostitute primarily because it is believed that she was unmarried and Magdala was a city destroyed for its fornication and because seven demons were cast out of her.  She is assumed to be the wife of Jesus primarily because of the gospel of Philip which says:  And the companion of the [...] Mary Magdalene. [...] loved her more than all the disciples, and used to kiss her often on her [...]. The rest of the disciples [...]. They said to him ""Why do you love her more than all of us?"" The Savior answered and said to them, ""Why do I not love you like her? When a blind man and one who sees are both together in darkness, they are no different from one another. When the light comes, then he who sees will see the light, and he who is blind will remain in darkness.""  [...] are holes in the text made by ants.  The kiss could be the kind a husband and wife shares or the kind the kind shared in the churches (Paul says greet each other with a holy kiss in Romans and Corinthians 1 and 2. As for Jesus loving her more than the rest, I think the blindness and the light could be a reference to Mary proving that she truly believed in all Jesus said and maybe how she proved that by being witness to his resurrection and telling the other disciples (according to the gospel of Mary they didn't believe her at first.). I thought it defeatist to such feminist scholars to imply that the assumed prostitution was wrong and created by masogynists as an assasination on her character, and in an effort to combat that theory and give her character credibility and assumption must be made that she was the wife of Jesus.  I see them as equally presuming and thusly counterproductive to an argument against such presumptions.  I also think that it would be underimining her role to stress her importance lying in her marriage to Jesus rather than what she did and was. I would rather stand out for my own beliefs and words and works than to stand out for being Anthony's wife.  On the other hand Ant ain't Jesus. I also thought it better to argue what is more clear, that she was really important, possibly most important of all people, to Jesus, as opposed to making the leap to marriage, as again I'll say you could argue either point with no end in sight.  As to the piece on the tenses in the original Hebrew, Hebrew tense is largely unlike English.  In Hebrew you have the perfect (completed) and the imperfect (incomplete) tenses.  You desire is for your husband and he does rule over you and your desire will be for your husband and he will rule over you would have the same tense.  As a Christian I believe that the Bible is the best tangible guide to discipleship of Christ.  I also recall that in Genesis the serpent twisted God's words to fit his purpose, and I think that this is still a common practice.  I think you must interpret the message of the Bible for yourself through prayer, in doing such I do not believe that I have cause to acknowledge that the Bible gives women a position subordinate to women as I do not believe that is God's word.  I think it is in the interpretation and the context that it is percieved that way.  The Hebrew word for spirit is ruach, which is a feminine noun.  In the beginning of Creation we know that God and the Ruach HaQodesh (Holy Spirit) existed.  You cannot seperate Elohim (the Hebrew word for God) from the Ruach HaQodesh, in fact Elohim is a plural noun, as it ecompasses the also the Holy Spirit or the trinity. I believe that is the way it is intended to be on earth male and female to be necessary to each other to help each other and not for one to be subordinate to the other. "
24937,3816360,"12,July,2004",2004-07-12,"   There are some really interesting theories floating around amongst Christian feminist scholars.  They are saying that some of things in the Bible regarding women were either misinterpreted or  purposely misleading to strengthen male roles.  Genesis 3:16 NIV says ...Your desire will be for your husband and he will rule over you.  These scholars believe that it was actually your desire is for your husband and he rules over you.  One is a prescription for how things will be and the other is a statement of how things are.  Then there's issues over Mary Magdalene, the scholars say that there is no evidence whatsoever that she was a prostitute.  They assume it was assumed that she was because it is known that she financially supported Jesus and the disciples to some extent, however she was unmarried and seemingly independently wealthy. It is known that she was very important to Jesus some say that she was the 13th disciple others say Jesus' wife.  Now here's the part that seems a bit defeatist she doesn't have to be a prostitute because she had money, but she has to be Jesus' wife to have been important to what he was doing?  In one of the books that didn't make the cut into the bible, Peter asks Mary what Jesus revealed to her personally and what she reveals deals more with the metaphysical or Gnostic principles. Apparently Jesus had not gotten into that sort of teaching with the twelve disciples.  This angered Peter and he asked her why would Jesus reveal something like that to you a woman, but not us.  One of the other disciples stepped in and said something to the effect of if she was important to Jesus who are we to question it. But it was Mary who was there when he crucified and there when he rose.  The weird thing is nearly 2000 year later Christianity is not that vastly different.  Women can teach, but the men must lead. Women can be leaders, but not the chiefs.  I am aware that the bible has men as the leaders of the church and home, but isn't that contextual.  Did Jesus in all his time spent on children and women and the poor the nobodies of that society ever say that men were to be the leaders.  I have thought and thought and though I can think of examples in which a man would be better for the job I can think of just as many where a woman would be better for the job.  I shudder to think that the most important role a woman can play in advancing God's kingdom would be pastor's wife, and I shudder to think that in order for Mary Magdalene to have been valuable to Christ's mission at the time she had to be his wife as opposed to his friend, follower, and confidant.

24938,3816360,"08,July,2004",2004-07-08,"   So plenty of my vegan and vegetarian friends have petitioned me to give up meat because of the awful steroids.  I admit steroids probably suck but, it's an issue of cost and convenience for me so I never really gave it much thought until recently.  Now anyone who's ever been around for long knows that my darling seventeen months old daughter is evil.  She furrows her eyebrows if you say anything to her without smiling, if you tell her to stop doing something she cries and asks to be held and seemingly lovingly buries her face into your shoulder, then she bites or digs her nails into your arm, or pinches.  She often confuses hello Ana for an attack and will smack the one who offered it hard across the face.  Unfortunately this offender is usually her four year old brother Joey and four year old sense of hope won't allow him to heed six year old wisdom, when Josh says stay away from her.  If you leave the computer for the bathroom she's sitting in from of it clicking and clacking away and furrows her eyebrows when you return  She drinks an exorbant amount, nearly a half gallon of milk every day.  So I blame the milk or the steroids in the milk for giving my baby a form of mad cow disease. I blame milk for making my baby evil and for the resulting hole she just made in my arm. "

I was more than happy reading the blogs of my friends from time to time, but the site wouldn't let me post a comment without registering for a blog, so I set one up but never used it. Until Josh wouldn't let me be the voice of reason and ignorance in keepin it real on his blog, so now I must stand on my own soapbox.  I'd much rather do it with other likeminded people so there wouldn't be so much pressure, but as much trash as I talk I should be able to rant forever.  Oh yeah do me a favor and comment.  It's really weird to just say stuff and no one responds.  Tell me I'm right, tell me I'm crazy, tell me you feel me, or that I'm wrong just tell me something. "
24940,3816360,"08,July,2004",2004-07-08,"   I watched a whole show about reality television the other day.  I felt a little bad cause they painted reality TV viewers as depraved. According to people who actually work for TV they're only about sex, drunkenness, and humiliation.  I get that it's probably just that to the producers, but I think people are always curious about other people's lives perhaps more so in the aforementioned areas.  'See if that was me' is a common phrase, I think people want more situations to say I would've done it this way.  For me it's a great deal of curiosity, how do people live what do they do, why do they do it.  I also like to talk trash from time to time and reality shows fuel that.  As for the humiliation piece maybe for some, but not for me.  I think the situations that humiliate people are funny not the actual humiliation.  Case in point, punk'd, most of the reactions are darn funny, not as much as Ashton talking trash, but close.  However when the person is actually humiliated i.e when Justin Timberlake called his mom in near tears that was sad.  I think identity is also a part of it. It's great to see yourself or people you know on TV.  So when I watched the real world reunion and Frankie's all it's not your problem but I just made it your problem and you misunderstood what I was saying when I said I hate you all and when I was pouting and being sullen and saying I don't wanna be here with these people I was actually having a good time and even though you're all sitting here with arms outstretched saying you'd like to be my friend I don't understand why you all hate me. I thought I knew the only Frankie in the world and have often considered myself incredibly stupid for leaving that hand outstretched. Because every now and again my hand turns into a visit or phone call and a resulting psychotic episode.  Now I know my friend isn't the only Frankie and I'm not the only dummy who, after hearing it's my fault but you did this and that and this wrong, still says lemmie get your number and I'll call you sometime.

2194,3816397,"12,July,2004",2004-07-12,"    The sad saga of the broken treadmill has led me to some self-discovery.    First, I'm very pleased that I don't have to pay someone to install the parts into it.  Sears would charge a pretty penny to send a repairman over here, and I feel confident that they would not hesitate to charge more than once in this saga.  So that's a victory in itself.  Second, I'm proud of myself and my persistence in pursuing the repair project through all these many calls.  It's annoying but I'm not letting it stop me.  Third, I've discovered that I really miss my treadmill.  I miss being able to walk after work each day.  Sure, I could walk outside.  Of course, it's presently 90 degrees out there.  And that's been the temperature every day lately.  So I *could* walk outside but I'd get a better walk on the treadmill.  Fourth, in an effort not to be stalled in my fitness goals I persuaded my partner to join the local rec center with me.  I think she's shocked that I would want to do that, since I've never been very athletic.  The thing is, I know that if I'm to become healthy I have to become more active.  And the local rec center offers a lot of options for that.  Plus it's reasonably priced and what we pay helps support the center for everyone.  And finally, I got creative today and looked into my college catalog.  We live very near a community college campus and I've been taking classes there for a couple of years.  It turns out that they have a fitness center on campus.  For the cost of one credit hour I can use the facility from August 23 through December 12, and taking a Physical Education class includes what amounts to guidance by a physical trainer!   So GO ME!!   "
2195,3816397,"01,July,2004",2004-07-01,"    I've been struggling with my treadmill for the past three weeks.  I love my treadmill, don't get me wrong.  But it's broken.  I've called and called for help.  The treadmill is a NordicTrack C1800.  Not very top of the line, but not entry-level.  Including delivery it was around $900 when we bought it, but I digress. We bought it in March last year.  So it's out of warranty for labor, but parts are still covered.  First call to tech support I was pleased to learn they'd let me install the replacement part myself and save the labor charges.  The tech put me through the diagnostics and concluded that the problem was a bad motor controller board.  This seemed reasonable based on the symptoms I had observed.  He ordered one to be sent to me, which I duly received 3 business days later.  This was on the weekend of the fourth of July. I installed the part.  To my dismay the problem persisted.  I called again on July 6.  Next diagnosis was a failed power board.  One was ordered.  I received it within 3 business days.  Installed it.  And the problem persists.   I called again this afternoon.  At this point we have diagnosed the likely problem to be a failed motor, which may be feeding current back to the motor controller board and zorching something.  I am now awaiting the delivery of a motor and a motor controller board.  And today's tech had the courtesy to upgrade the shipping to UPS Air so I should have it in hand on Wednesday.  And then we shall see if the problem is fixed.   "

18089,3818197,"03,July,2004",2004-07-03,"   Funny thing.  I'm glad someone posted a comment actually asking on what my research is about.  I guess I have failed to talk a bout that since I started my blog.  My bad.  Let me tell ya.  The idea for my research came to me as I was leaving the airport on my way back from Seattle last April.  I decided I wanted to do some work based on the experiences of refugees based on the concept of diaspora.  At first, I was ready to go out there and interview everyone who has come to this country as a refugee in order to preserve their oral histories.  Then I realize how absurd that goal was considering that I only have an X amount of time to actually complete this research and have a thorough analysis of the cases studied.  So I had to narrow down and that was really hard.  I trully wanted to go out there and spend the rest of my time interviewing families and getting to hear all their stories.  So I decided to go by gender.  Females.  Then I decided Afghan women would be an excellent group to work with.  Then I spent a week in Indiana at a McNair Senior Conferences and ended up coming home with yet another change of heart.  Since I am a double major and I have an equal amount of love for both of the degrees I have been persuing (Spanish and Multi Ethnic Studies), I decided that it would fit both categories if I worked on the experiences of Cuban refugees in Idaho, more specifically in Boise.  For example, I'm curious to know why they have resettle in this area of the country as oppose to an are such as Florida or New York where there are thousands of 'compatriotas'.  Now, I have been refining that even further into what exaclty is that i want to get from this.  This is what I got so far: As a two part project I have set up to go on with the recording of the oral histories, I am getting ready to lear how to transcribe them so that I have a solid data base to base my reasearch on.  I want to explore the causes and consequences of resettlement and the effects that this has in these people's lifes.  I also want to go into the politic aspect of it and find out more about the role that both the government of the U.S and Cuba play in these people's life's decitions.  Or something like that.  So, at a huge glance, there you have it.   "

So, needless to say my feet have been several inches off the ground due to my absolute disbelief that this is our new car!  Ok, enough about that, what it's really touching and really relevant to everyone else, is that last night we went and saw Farenheit 9/11 at the Flicks.  I really wasn't prepared by any means to come face to face with the reality of war as described by Michael Moore.  And even less by the reality of what this government is doing behind everyone's back.  I felt good and bad because even though as I left the theater I had learned so much, I can't forgive myself for having lived in such obliviousness through the 4 years of the reign of terror that has been Bush's presidency.  There is only one thing to say to all of this: this man (if you can call it that) cannot, be re-elected.  I feel I need to go bang on the INS's door and demand a citizenship just so I can go out and vote in November.  This country can't afford another year with this government. Is just not right. It hasn't been from day one, but it is still salvagable.  I guess I'm just in awe of how ignorant the general public truly is about what goes on at the higher levels of the government.  It makes sense that they keep us so busy looking at add and getting us to buy everything under the sun or keep us petrified with their ups and downs in the country's security levels.  By the way, yes, I did feel like an ass getting into our new car and driving home after such a compelling documentary.   I'm at a loss of words.   "
18091,3818197,"01,July,2004",2004-07-01,"   So... here I am.  After reading most of Marcy's and Echo's postings of their intrepid adventures in Egypt I couldn't help but to want my very own blog.  Now, I am not off into any adventure this summer, so it took me about three weeks to figure out why exactly I needed to have this blog.  I have been, however, quite busy trying to put together a research project that has taken a huge amount of my energy in the past 5 weeks and it is a totally new experience for me.  So I decided, why not a blog where I can rant on about my frustrations and gains through the process of researching, or better yet, learning to reseach? And so, I figure I can justify my very own blog in the fact that I am going to drive myself crazy unless I have an outlet to vent out while working on this project.  Plus, I figure if I rant long enough about something, maybe some really break through ideas for the project may come to mind.  That would be awesome. As of yesterday, I felt as if I had already lost the battle with research before it had even begun.  I had been fairly warned that while doing research some of the most common feelings would be dispair and frustration.  I guess people can pre warn you all they want, but it really doesn't mean anything until you truly experience it on your own shoes.  So it hit m about a week ago and I was ready to quit when David Hall called up a ""cohort meeting"" of sorts to have everyone who was interested in sharing their own experiences come up and speak up their minds.  A total of four of us showed up and as soon as everybody else started speaking I realize that I was by no means the only person feeling at an absolute loss.  In fact (not that this is a good thing), there were a couple people that were almost worst off than I was!! So, I left the meeting feeling MUCH better and that was followed up by yet another great meeting with my mentors today. This is why I decided today would be a good day to start up a blog.   "
18092,3818197,"08,July,2004",2004-07-08,"   What is it about people that they always think to fix your life before they can start contemplaiting their own?  I am writing while I'm still very upset over an email from a long time ""friend"" of my husband's who I inherited through him as well.  This ""friend"" of ours has been sending us over the summer series of emails on various topics including how Zack and mine married relationship sucks (this is possibly why we are so unhappy we've been together very happily for almost 9 years!), how we are shallow, unimotional and unspiritual people or how my husband is heavily influenced by me (which is funny considering that one of my biggest prides is that I rejoyce in the influence that my husband has in my life), and that this is why he will always fail at what he's [my husband] doing.  In the latest email he calls Zack's father and myself overbearing.  Zack's father doesn't even live in the same continent as us and this ""friend"" of ours hasn't seen him in the last 5 years or so. And yes, I can be overbearing, specially when I'm being told how to live and how to think and told even how to cook in my own house by someone who has no right to do so.  I can get overbearing and defensive just as anybody else would under those circumstances. He suggests that Zack needs to get away from us and leave with him and go to the mountains just like they used to.  I detect a bit of insanity here.  Most people don't understand the meaning of growing up and growing appart.  I think it has happened to all of us that while in this transition of 'growing up' (if there's such a thing) we loose people that we considered to be the greatest of friends.  I lost several ""best friends"" from high school just because we didn't see each other eye to eye in many, many issues, but we didn't send each other nasty emails, we didn't even get mad.  We simply acknowledged the fact that our lifes had become very different and moved on.  I still keep in touch with the majority of them, but no longer at a deep level like we used to.  And that is perfectly ok.  I feel angry, frustrated and very dissapointed with this person.  I can't speak on behalf of my husband, but I know he's at the end of his rope too.  We have choosen to not even respond to our ""friend's"" allegations because every time we see his name on our email all we can do is hold on tight as we read the series of negative, borderline insanely hurtful comments that follow, and the worst part is that, no matter how hard I've tried to look at this 'negative reinforcement' under a positive light, I can't find reasons to justify continuing a friendship with someone who uses you (us) as his scapegoat for all his frustrations, failures and sources of anger.  The part that always gets me is how the emails end in a: You guys know I love you like family...   "
18093,3818197,"06,July,2004",2004-07-06,"   In order to get my research on its way I need to go through an IRB evaluation. What is IRB you may wonder? Well, IRB is the Institutional Review Board, the people in charged of making sure you are not going to harm amyone while carrying on your research. I have been working along my mentor(s) for the last few weeks getting this IRB package put together and I think I finally got it to a point to where it looks good enough for them (IRB) to eat.  So, now comes the fun part. Well almost. I still need to get through the lit review and then I get to start doing interviews. I'm really excited about that. I'm not exactly sure how it all will pan out, but I'm sure it will be an amazing experience anyway.   "
18094,3818197,"17,July,2004",2004-07-17,"   Today, I am writting from Coeur d' Alene.  I am up here for a  friend's wedding with my friend Christy.  Last night while talking  to Taylor who is the son of the lady that very gracefuly offered to  host us while in town, the topic of white supremacy came up.   Today, the Arian Nations were holding their annual White Power parade  in downtown.  Needless to say I headed that way this morning to  participate in history in the making.  I had mental images of KKK  hodded people and imagined hundreds of hateful people parading through  the streets of this beautiful city.  I feared for my safety, but  my curiosity was bigger than my fears.  As we arrived there, there  were dozens of police officers and both of the main streets were  blocked off to trafic.  We stood a block away from where they were  marching and saw all 20 members of the Arian Nations congregation, most  of which are well beyond 65 years of age ridicule themselves in front  of dozens of very angry citizens protesting their mere presence.   Up on an old bit up white truck, was Richard Buttler himself, equiped  with wheel chair and oxygen tank.   Every time they chanted  ""White Power!"" the general public response was, ""Shut up and GO  HOOOME!!""  This is one of the most incredible displays I've seen  in my life.  Across the street from where we were standing, there  where at least three dozen riot police officers in full gear awaiting  further instructions.  They took over the whole street and  proceded to load up into unmarked white cars that where lined up, four  policemen and policewomen per car plus two suburbans with officers  hanging in both sides of the cars.  There were also an Explosive  Disarming Unit and an Emergency Response vehicle along side fire trucks  with their hosses set to disperse any riot that may break out.  I  was a witness to all this on July 17, 2004.   "
18095,3818197,"13,July,2004",2004-07-13,"   Sunday my husband and I went to see Farenheit 9/11 for the second time with 4 family members who had not seen it yet.  I thought for sure that the second time around this would be an easier film to watch, but boy, was I wrong! Afterwards we went down to the Flying M and sipped on cold coffee and discussed pur feelings about it for a couple of hours.  Now, for those of you who know Zack, you know him as a very quiet, borderline shy person who only speaks when something is truly important is to be said.  Well, he has started speaking and nodoby is going to be able to stop him now.  Zack works in a place where everyone around him owns at least a gun, very conservative, Bush supporter, Christians.  He is a sort of odd-duck but has always been treated with lots of respect and his views have always been inf anything, tolerated.  On Sunday, he brought up the fact that he really wanted to put up money for people where he works to pay for the ticket to go see the film.  Today this is the email he sent out:     ""To each person at -------, I am personally putting up $20 of my own money for you to go see Fahrenheit 9/11 - no strings attached.  All I ask is that you watch it with an open heart and mind, preferably with your families, from beginning to end.  I strongly believe that this is one of the most important films of our lifetime, and each of us as American citizens owes it to ourselves and our families to at least watch it all the way through.    If you think that you already know what this film is about (2 hours of Bush-bashing propaganda and Michael Moore preaching lies to you about how awful America is) then that's all the more reason you should go watch it.    I'm the type of person that is not easily fooled or swayed by clever editing, especially knowing how easy it is to skew perception in one's favor by splicing speeches and only portraying one side of an issue.  With such close scrutiny on Michael Moore these days, I walked into Fahrenheit 9/11 with a lot of skepticism, and as I was watching it, tried to separate each video clip from the film and place it back into the context from which it was taken, hoping to get the most honest, unbiased view of each person represented.  Even despite the parts I disagreed with, this film left me shocked, saddened, and outraged at at what is going on in our country right under our noses.  There are numerous honest, real, uncut interviews and sections of press footage that simply cannot be ignored.    Please see this film in the theaters.  Don't wait until it comes to home video.  It's playing at The Flicks downtown or Edward's at these show-times:[attachment here].   Matinee prices are about $5.50 if you go before 5:15pm (weekdays or weekends).  Even if you get nothing else from it, at the very least I'll make it free for you, plus $12-$15 in your pocket for at least giving it a try.  Zachary Black  The only thing I edited out of this email was the location of his workplace for privacy.  So far, his boss compromised to go watch it and will also take his family along...   "

25708,3818324,"03,July,2004",2004-07-03,"   Wonderland, heh, my Wonderland is a place where I have emotions that don't land me in a horrable place after. I'm writing this from the true and black depths of my black little heart. Everything I say is true, and I need to get this out, regardless of who or what reads it:  Emotions just fuck me over in the end, its all god damn pantomime! Never once have I ever felt anything for anyone that was returned without a slap in the face! The only person in my life, I ever loved, who loved me back to the best of my knowledge gave me what I thought the point to be the best gift ever. Whenever I was depressed he'd just let me sleep in his arms for as long as I needed to. Or he would cry with me when everything just became too hard. Now I'm nothing! Its better to have loved and lost, than never to have loved at all?!? Thats bullshit! Because once you've loved and lost it, you have nothing at all!  Those times when he used to hold me are now haunting me. We used to go to a friend's house and just sleep in the couch, not doing anything... just sleeping, or crying, or shareing the sweet serenity that was each other's silent thoughts. Now when I look at a couch, or a bed, with the intention of sleeping I'm just haunted by everything. I can't sleep, sometimes I wake up wrapped so tightly in my blankets I think he's there, sometimes I can even smell his lavander after-shave. Its all pantomime, pretending somethings there when its not.  I'm the Queen of Fools, to think that with every possible male I might find that something I'm missing. I've yet to find any mate in life that holds up long enough to see me cry, none do, and I doubt any ever will. My expectations are too high, especially for one such as myself.   I'm 17 years old, I've loved once and lost ever since. This Wonderland is just a dream, a world where people mean what they say.. and emotions are all they're cracked up to be.  Its pathetic I know. Trust me, I know.   "

I'm 17 years old, metaly ill so my doctors say, though I think they were just being sarcastic, and some mixed up mess between gothic\punk\and rockstar. Don't ask about rockstar, people get the impression I'm famous from my appearence and mannerisums I guess. I don't look like one, most of the time I look like I just woke up... because I probably did.   Well, well... The unfortunate day has come... I'M HERE! Though more than likely anyone who reads this has probably scrolled over it looking for some kind of porpose, I'll tell you in advance There isn't one!  Lets see, anything I can write about? AH yes! I spent the entire day at Niagra trying to find some sort of word to discribe all the bordom suffered. Then I realized bored is about it. It really isn't a pretty thing to sit next to Lake Ontario and eat lunch. I wasn't sure weather I'd vomit or die. The water smelled like raw sewage, there was dead fish in the water... and people were letting their children swim in it! *shudders*  I have nothing to do at all, Canada day used to be reserved for sparklers and alcohol... but I rarely drink anyway, and I find playing with sparkers ends in setting things on fire. However I'm not allowed to play with sparklers anymore, and a grapefruit cooler is about all I really want. So looks like I'll be home watching sick humored movies and writing stories.

10163,3819051,"04,July,2004",2004-07-04,"    I am the one and only guru. This time i have come in the form of a hardcore teacher. One day when i was playing my holy xbox, i noticed some people sneek by my holy ashram. I had to pause my game and see what it was. It was the mudafu**in teletubies, so i decided to do something rather not so nice to them.      I hated the teletubies because they were a bunch of hardcore losers. They had come to my&nbsp;ashram to get a blessing, but couldn't find the door. I thought they were rather thick in the head, because my door, to the ashram won an award for biggest yet humblest door! I felt that they needed a punishment because of criricising my door, by thinking very  little  of it.      &nbsp;    So this is the punishment they got:      &nbsp;     &nbsp;    When walking by... &nbsp;&nbsp;      &nbsp;     &nbsp;     &nbsp;     &nbsp;     &nbsp;     &nbsp;    When buggering me...  &nbsp;       &nbsp;     &nbsp;     &nbsp;     &nbsp;     &nbsp;    When getting on my nerves...     &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;    when they couldn't find moi door ala fantastique... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      &nbsp;     &nbsp;     &nbsp;    When they criticised my door...       &nbsp;     &nbsp;     &nbsp;    When there was only one left... &nbsp;i did it myself...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      &nbsp;     &nbsp;     &nbsp;     &nbsp;     &nbsp;     &nbsp;     &nbsp;     &nbsp;     &nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;taught em' a lesson!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"

13986,3821176,"25,July,2004",2004-07-25,"    JULY NEWSLETTER  2004    Hi everyone. It finally feels like summer, a bit too much like summer if you ask me. Itâ€™s been in the 80â€™s which isnâ€™t so bad until you remember thereâ€™s no nice, cool, air conditioned building in which you can find refuge. I wonâ€™t complain too much because Iâ€™ve had a fabulous summer. We havenâ€™t had any visitors this summer so we had to find ways to amuse ourselvesâ€¦..and we did.     MY MISTER MAKES MASTER    Joe isnâ€™t the type to brag and will never toot his own horn (or saxophone) but I will do it for him. He tested for Master Sergeant in March and just found out that he passed and will pin on his new stripes on August 1st. This may not seem big news to you but it is very important to our future. Joe will be retiring in 2 years and our retirement pay is based on the last three years of service. The higher the rank, the higher the pay, the happier we are. So, Master Sergeant Ott has lots to be proud of!     INDEPENDENCE DAY (sort of)    The fourth of July has always been a fun holiday for most people. It usually includes family or friends, barbeques and of course fireworks. This year was the first time in nineteen years that Joe has not worked on this holiday. We were so excited just at the idea of this and had no idea what to do. Just a reminder that we live in Germany. Independence Day is not so important to the Germans. There are celebrations on the military bases but the crowds are unbelievable and we didnâ€™t feel like the fight. So, a friend had a barbeque for those of us that didnâ€™t have any exciting plans. Joe was one of two men there due to the fact that the others were working. He was the barbeque master and we had a fun time even without the fireworks.     SOUP, SALAD AND COFFEE    I recently went out to lunch with some friends from school. All are American except one. As we were placing our orders, this German friend of mine began to giggle when it was my turn.&nbsp; I assumed that I was pronouncing something incorrectly so I just joined in with the giggling and asked what it was that I said that was so funny. She said my pronunciations were perfect but what I ordered was funny to her. I wasnâ€™t getting the joke at all. I had ordered a salad, some soup and water. Apparently, Germans donâ€™t consider this a meal and somehow find it funny that we Americans eat this way quite often. She recently went to a party with a theme. When I think of themed parties I think of a luau or Mexican food or even a costume party. The theme of this party was based on a supposedly American idea: Soup, Salad and coffee. Everyone had to bring a dish that fit that theme. They had great fun with this idea.     MOM, LOOK!    Have you ever been to the zoo and looked at the animals, perhaps the chimpanzees, and pointed at them, gawked at them, made noises at them, etc.?&nbsp; I think everyone has done this sometime in their life. But have you ever wondered what it must be like to that chimp, the one thatâ€™s being pointed at, gawked at, had rude noises directed to him? Probably not. Well, I think we have, indirectly.  Joe and I were recently walking along the fussganger in Kaiserslautern . By the way, a fussganger is simply a pedestrian zone where there are no cars. Itâ€™s fun to walk, shop and sit outside at the cafes having a drink. I heard a boy say something in broken English that shocked me just a bit. He seemed to be about 10 years old, not a toddler whom you might expect inappropriate behavior from. He pointed at one of us, weâ€™re not quite sure which, he gawked at us and he said, â€œMom, lookâ€¦itâ€™s an American.â€ How did he know that? Why was it such a big deal to him? What makes us so spectacular to look at? We get what we call the â€œDeutcher Stareâ€ aka â€œGerman Stareâ€, quite often but this crossed the line. I donâ€™t like to be pointed at, gawked at, nor have rude comments directed at me.   &nbsp;    BMDCVZ    B is for Bavaria  MD is for Munich/Dachau  C is for Castles  V is for Venice  Z is for Zugspitz   This year we decided to stay in Germany for our vacation. We spent most of our time in Bavaria and it has to be one of the most beautiful places in the world. This was a vacation of contrasts. Read on and youâ€™ll understand what I mean.  On our first day we arrived at our hotel at about 1:30pm. We checked, breathed in the clean air and took in the breath taking view of the Bavarian mountains, including the Zugspitz, and headed straight for the Linderhof Castle 30 minutes later. King Lugwig II had this castle (among others) built and it is the only one that was completedâ€¦â€¦after 9 years of construction! We went into the grotto where Wagnerâ€™s Tannhauser played-this was an indulgence on Ludwigâ€™s fantasies about the music of Wagner. One thing that I thought was funny was how to tell if the king was in his castle. He loved peacocks and swans and they were placed all over the castle. If you wanted to know if the king was in the castle you just had to look for two peacocks outside the entrance. If they were out, he was in. If not, he wasnâ€™t. No flags for this king!  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We still had some time so we stopped into a town called Ettal. This town is known for the Kloster, or seminary. We went into the church and were lucky enough to see the beginning of the mass. There were about 25 monks and they were singing beautifully. We both felt a spiritual vibe while in there. These monks also make their own beer called Klosterbier. We figure thatâ€™s why monks always have such a nice, peaceful look on their faces. In fact, have you ever seen a skinny monk? Probably not, because they all make their own beer. This tradition started many years ago but not for the reason you might think. It was necessary because it had all the nutrients of brown bread but kept much longer without going bad and so the people almost always had beer with their meals.     MUNICH    Our second day was spent on a tour of Munich and Dachau. As we drove through this area, Joe called it the land of the Porsche. Thatâ€™s his favorite car. However, we passed a Mercedes corporate headquarters and every car they make was on display and every car was silver. To me, it looked like a giant matchbox car display. We only had a short time in Munich so we made sure we saw the highlights. We first saw the glockenspiel which has a mechanical marionette type of performance. The clock rang at 11am and then the show started. The story is of how the people were dying from the plague and they were fighting amongst each other. Finally the plague was gone and the people dance in the streets. This is an abbreviated version of the story and may not be exact. I didnâ€™t get to hear it very clearlyJ We had lunch in the famous Hofbrauhaus. As we sat down the waiter very clearly announced to the others that we were Americans. I donâ€™t know why. Perhaps, so weâ€™d get menus in English. Not so. Once again, we stand out. Anyway, the food was good but typical German and the beer was excellent. It was rather quiet at the time which surprised us until we realized that we were in the restaurant and not the beer garden which is where Oktoberfest is held. Oh well, maybe next time.&nbsp;  We went on to Dachau. I never really realized that Dachau is a city. I always associated it with Hitler and the concentration camps. It is actually a lovely city and the inhabitants would like you to know it. Unfortunately, I am among the majority in my ignorance of this city. All I know of Dachau is the horrific events that took place. This was a rather sobering part of the day. I took pictures but somehow found it difficult. It didnâ€™t seem right to be photographing evidence of such horrors. I did take some pictures but Joe and I arenâ€™t in any of them. We had an excellent tour guide who had some insight that others didnâ€™t. He had a friend who was a prisoner in Dachau. In fact, he was a prisoner in two camps and was freed while in a third. He has since passed away but a book was written about him. His name was Marvin and he was Czech. The book is called, â€œThe Last Survivorâ€. Unfortunately, I didnâ€™t get his last name. Iâ€™m going to search online for it. Anyway, Marvin would come to Dachau and interrupt tour groups when he heard the guides sharing information. It seems that the Germans have tried to somehow sanitize the whole thing and have even left out information on the signs. Just recently they have admitted and put on the signs that there were gas chambers but they deny that they were used for mass killings. Marvin would tell you otherwise. He also knew of places where people were told to stand up against a concrete wall where they were shot in the head. Again, the Germans have covered this up by growing vines on the wall, but if you know they are there, you could see the bullet holes in the wall. It was difficult to imagine. Just next to the wall was a ditch. It looked like any other grass covered ditch until you found out it was used as a blood drainage ditch. We wondered why they drained the bodies. They did this because they piled all the dead bodies into a truck and transported them somewhere else. They did not want people to know what they were doing so they drained the bodies of blood so that it would not flow out of the truck when they were driving on the highway!&nbsp; Across from the ditch were some trees that were used for hanging. The prisonersâ€™ hands were bound behind their backs and they were hung by their wrists. If they made any sort of noise, they were tortured even more. The guards would swing them like a pendulum until their arms were torn out of their sockets.  Other things that were cleverly covered were the electric guard fences. This has been landscaped to look like what youâ€™d see growing wild in the forest. There were 30 barracks at the time of this horror but only 2 are left standing. We walked through the gas chamber. I asked Joe how this made him feel and he said guilty. â€œHere I am touring and looking at something these people died in,â€ was his response. We also went into a cell for â€œspecial prisonersâ€. These prisoners were supposedly treated better than the others. Many were doctors and clergymen. This also made us feel weird about walking through the cells. We felt the spirit of what those prisoners must have felt. We saw standing cells. These cells look like upright coffins and the prisoners were bound at the legs so they could not bend their knees. They were unable to move at all. They were kept in these cells for days, weeks and sometimes months. &nbsp;The gas chambers and the ovens were the most difficult to look at. If you saw the picture of the oven now, you might think it was a brick oven for cooking bread or pizza. But the realty is much worse. Many times, the prisoners were hung just to make sure they were dead. The hooks are gone or rather removed by the Germans but the pulley system is still there. We could see how they were hung, killed and lowered to the ground and unto the ovens. Two to three people could fit into the ovens. The gas chambers looked like a large showering area and this is what the prisoners were told it was. But once the gas poured through the â€œshower headsâ€ they knew the truth. It was eerie to stand in such a horrific place and we have no intention of going back but think it was important to see.  We ended that day with a drink on our balcony overlooking the mountains. We needed to wind down from our hectic and emotional day. Following are some quotes from the one and only, JoeJ  â€œIf I were king for a day, this is where Iâ€™d be.â€  â€œLook at this long and hard. Youâ€™ll never see it again when we get back to the states.â€  â€œFirst you see valleys of green and above you see that! Youâ€™d have to be dead not to appreciate this beauty.â€     Neuschwanstein Castle    &nbsp;The Neuschwantein Castle is another of King Ludwigâ€™s castles. This castle is the most famous in Germany and is used in many advertisements. It is known as the fairy tale castle and was Disneyâ€™s inspiration for the castle in Disneyworld. Three castles were built and a 4th was planned but never built. This one was incomplete and had only three floors completed. The Throne Room was decorated in the Byzantine style including crown shaped candelabras and chandeliers, all solid brass with glass cutouts. The throne room was missing one thingâ€¦â€¦ the throne! It never got done. When you looked out the windows you saw incredible view of the Alps, waterfalls and snow.  This took the better part of the day but we still had some time to explore Garmisch, Germany. We did some window shopping when we passed a beer garden and an oompah band. What more does one need?  We also found the Olympic Ice Stadium where Joeâ€™s hockey team had a tournament last year. This was the year that he broke his wrist and was unable to play. We found a professional hockey team from the Czech Republic practicing. This was thrilling for Joe. One of the coaches kept looking at Joe. We think he thought Joe was from another team and was checking out their style of play.&nbsp; As we entered the arena I noticed a remarkable change in Joe. His entire body took on a more upright position. He heard that first slap shot and it was like he was home. &nbsp;As Joe says, â€œI coulda been a contenda!â€     The Zugspitz    &nbsp;The Zugspitz Mountain is the highest point in Germany. We continue with Joeâ€™s therapy on his fear of heights. Why not go to the highest point in Germany and the success of his therapy? Hee, hee. Well, he did quite well. I think the beauty overtook his fear. We drove to a lake called the Eibsee. All the water around here is a bluish-green color due to the high concentration of minerals especially calcium and the fact that it is glacier water. We took a train through the mountain. I do not mean around the mountain. I literally mean through the mountain. This took about 45 minutes and was mostly dark except for the entrance and exit from the mountain. We were let off several feet below the top of the mountain. As everyone was deboarding the train, they were putting on sweatshirts and jackets, preparing for the 32 degree temperature. As we walked outside, we were greeting with an intense orange sun, a perfect blue sky and whiter than white snow. How odd to see snow in the middle of July! Although this is a ski area and the rail runs through it, it remains relatively untouched. We sat on a rock next to a mountain chapel and just took it all inâ€¦.the absolute beauty of nature. I could have sat their all day. It was a perfect meditation spot. We finally resolved ourselves to the fact that sooner or later we would have to move on. We took a 4 minute glacier rail car to the top of the Zugspitz. There were several terraces for taking pictures from different vantage points. Thank goodness for digital cameras! We noticed quite a difference in the temperature. It was about 25 degrees at the top and quite gusty. We enjoyed a nice bratwurst and pretzel. We decided to be monk like and enjoyed a bit of the klosterbier, made by those wonderful, happy and peaceful monks. While we were eating, we were able to see four countries: Germany, Italy, Switzerland and Austria. But the clouds began to roll in and suddenly some of the mountains and other countries seemed to disappear before our eyes.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was time to go back down to the Eibsee via a 10 minute cable car ride. As we looked down we saw the real athletes, hiking up! We thought about doing this ourselves but when we found out it takes 6-8 hours we thought better of it. We were definitely not prepared for that and didnâ€™t have Zoe, the dog, to help pull us upJ     Venice     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I mentioned before, this has been a vacation of contrasts. We saw the beauty of the mountains and the horrors of a concentration camp. We saw the simplicity of the monks and the decadence of King Ludwig II. We saw the greenery of the valleys below the mountains and the snow atop them. On this day, we took a day bus tour to Venice, Italy. Venice is only 5 hours from Bavaria so we decided to take advantage of the tour. This was a marked contrast, simply because we traveled to another country where the temperatures were about 85 with no relief in sight. It was difficult deciding what to wear because it was cool in Bavaria but would be hot in Venice. I decided on a pair of long jean, a tank top and a sweater. I will explain the importance of my ensemble later.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Venice has no cars in its city. You can only get to it by boat. We took a taxi, a water taxi to the city. The waters were incredibly busy, even scary with all the crazy Italian drivers. Once we were dropped off at Saint Markâ€™s Square we were on our own. Our guide offered to organize a gondola ride through the canals. Although you may have a romantic notion about this, itâ€™s not all itâ€™s cracked up to be. Venice is not a clean city and the odors in the narrow canals can be stifling. We chose not to do it for this reason as well as the high cost and our limited time. Joe has been here so knew certain spots to show me. We went into St. Marks Basilica. Here is where my outfit became important. There was a specific dress code for entering this sacred building. No shorts (men or women), and no tank tops. Several people had to step aside and were given shawls to cover themselves. Hereâ€™s another one of those contrasts. Italy is know for its style and the women are dressed beautifully, if not scantily. They are quite open and comfortable with their sexuality but donâ€™t be a wearinâ€™ that outfit in the churches! They wonâ€™t let you in. The Basilica is in the Byzantine style with mosaic floors as well as the mosaic artwork in the atriums. The ceilings are pure gold. It looks completely different from any other cathedral we have seen and weâ€™ve seen plenty.  &nbsp;Time did not allow for lots of museum tours so we did lots of walking and looking. We saw the Bridge of Sighs which connects Doges Palace with the prison. Apparently Dogeâ€™s Palace takes about a half day to tourâ€¦.maybe next timeâ€¦.when you come visitJ We walked/ran along the Grand Canal. No strolling allowed at this time. We also saw Rialto Square, famous for its market, vendors and shopping. The market had beautiful fruits and veggies and not so beautiful meatsâ€¦.rawâ€¦.with heads and fins and feathers. EEEKKK!!! The outdoor vendors are jammed between the narrow streets. You have no choice but to look. We were literally surrounded by Murano glass, Venetian masks, leather and any other trinkets a tourist might buy. Joe has been here a few times and bought a murano vase for me so this time we bough a mask. Iâ€™m not a collector and wasnâ€™t interest in the real thing but did want something unique to Venice. I found a neat one along with a red leather shoulder bag. Joe goes to the same vendor every time he tours to Venice so he tried to talk the price down but was pretty much ignored. Supposedly, Italians find this insulting.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think I can vaguely relate to mice and rats. Venice is a city of narrow canals and even narrower streets. There are plenty of signs to the cityâ€™s highlights, museums and churches but it can still be confusing, especially if you miss a sign. Even though Joe has been here, he still gets lost. We would be crossing a canal on a bridge, walk down a narrow streetâ€¦ By the way, let me explain narrow. Generally speaking your height is the same as your wingspan (your arms stretched out shoulder height. I am 5â€™2â€ and could spread out my arms while standing in the middle of the street and nearly touch the building on either side. The Rialto market was twice this width which is still quite narrow. Now back to the rats and mice. Weâ€™d take that street which only led on way. So like a rat or mouse in a maze, we followed it around several bends only to find a dead end. Weâ€™d turn around thinking we could retrace our steps only to wonder, â€œDid we turn here or did we go further?â€ Weâ€™d just chuckle when we saw others doing the same thing. After a lime and lemon gelato (Italian ice) we re-boarded the water taxi and the 5 hour bus ride back to Bavaria.&nbsp;   &nbsp;"

Iâ€™m not sure based on the weather but I am sure based on the fact that school is out for the summer. Iâ€™ve already made the most of my summer and Joe has toured to England and Bulgaria and is now back here in Germany. We have plans to go to Garmisch, Germany where the Zugspitz Mountain is in July. That will be quite a contrast to my trip to Spain. Read on if you like.    HEXENNACHT- WITCHES NIGHT  Hexennacht translates to witches night and is similar to our Halloween without the trick or treating. Some villages partake more than others. Our village is tiny yet we still had the parade of children on hayrides partying through the streets. This exciting night also offers the opportunity to have your house, car, trees, etc. toilet papered or sprayed with shaving cream. We have so many kids under the age of five that it is funny to hear them. They get so excited to participate in this silly tradition. You can hear them outside laughing and trying to be quiet as they throw a roll of toilet paper at a bush or ask their parents to help them push the button on the shaving cream can. Itâ€™s all in good fun and the best part is that they clean up after themselves the next day!   NO SHIRTS NEEDED  We recently took our 4th and 5th graders on a field trip to a planetarium and park. Special arrangements were made to have the presentation at the planetarium given in English. I mentioned to some of the other teachers that perhaps we should ask the kids to wear their school shirts to identify ourselves as a group. The German teacher happened to overhear me say this and said, â€œOh, this is not necessary.â€ I asked why only because in my previous experience at other schools we always had name tags at the very least. She explained to me that everyone will know we are together because we are Americans. I still havenâ€™t quite figured out what it is about us that makes us stand out so much in a crowd, but apparently we do. We needed no identifying shirts, nametags or anything else. Simply being American was enough.   LAZY GOATS  I recently was visiting with my landlord in her beautiful garden when I heard our neighbor mumble something. You may remember me telling you about Frau Bauer. She is an 83 year old lady that works constantly. She is always cleaning, gardening, climbing apple or cherry trees and she rides her bike to the market. In fact, sometimes I get tired just thinking about all the hard, physical work she does. She was very kind to my parents when they stayed with her and of course, loves Zoe (the dog). Well, as Karla, my landlord, and I were visiting I heard Frau Bauer say something. She often talks to herself so I didnâ€™t really pay close attention to her. Karla started to giggle and asked me if I understood what she just said. All I got was something about the goats. Karla does have two goats so I still didnâ€™t think much of it. Then she explained that Frau Bauer had just called us two lazy goats because we were not doing any work! I can honestly say that I donâ€™t believe I have ever been referred to as a goat and donâ€™t think I like it. Have you seen a goat lately? They are not the most attractive animals in the world. I then realized that Frau Bauer does not appreciate the finer things in lifeâ€¦â€¦like sitting on a bench overlooking fields and mountainsâ€¦.sipping a cool glass of mineral waterâ€¦â€¦.chatting with a friendâ€¦..possiblyâ€¦.maybeâ€¦â€¦.kinda likeâ€¦â€¦.a â€¦..ummmmmâ€¦.hmmmmâ€¦.okâ€¦â€¦a lazy goat!   SYMBOLS OF AMERICA  When you think of symbols of America Iâ€™m sure you think of the flag, stars and stripes, the national anthemâ€¦.maybe even baseball and hotdogsâ€¦..but do you think of McDonalds, Burger King and Walmart? I donâ€™t. At school, we recently received a warning that terrorists are targeting Americans overseas. The places they look for us is in these American icons and we have been cautioned not to go to these places. I know these are all known as American places of business but do we really have to have our identity defined by fast food and one stop shopping?   GARDEN-RING  As you may remember, our landlords are avid gardeners. They have flowers, vegetables, fruit trees, everything. Karla was working in her garden and they had decided to move some flowers from one place to another. As she was working she was sifting through the ground removing rocks and stones when she hit upon a ring. It was solid gold ring and quite a surprise. She cleaned it off and realized it looked familiar and then it hit her where this ring came from. Reinhold was engaged before he met Karla. When the engagement was broken he buried the ring. This occurred over 30 years ago! None of us is quite sure why he buried the ring and we havenâ€™t discussed it. I think there is more of a story to the burial of that ring but I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll ever know what it is. The more you know the more you want to know. But I wonâ€™t.   ITâ€™S ALL SET IN JELLO  Itâ€™s all set in jello. This is not what you want to hear when you are trying to keep your job. I was once again on the chopping block for my school. I think I told you that I am now considered permanent and guaranteed a jobâ€¦â€¦world wide. My hope was to stay right where I am. However, that is not to be. Change is good and Iâ€™m getting it. I am going to be teaching at the same school but not 4th or 5th grade. Iâ€™ll be teaching Gifted Education to 4th-8th graders and one class of 5th reading skills. Iâ€™ll be working both ends of the spectrum as far as ability goes. I like change and I like a challenge. Iâ€™m ready for both! However, all of this is set in jello. That is a direct quote from the principal. So no matter what I do in the fall, it WILL be a change.   MALLORCA  Mallorca is an island of the coast of Spain and is sometimes known as Germanyâ€™s 15th state. I went there to celebrate the end of the school year with four other teachers. The Mediterraenean Sea is the most beautiful water I have ever seen. It is blue, itâ€™s turquoise, itâ€™s green and itâ€™s clear. The highlight of the trip for me was snorkeling. I have always wanted to try this but never had the opportunity. We took a short boat ride out to some caves and after a mini lesson, jumped in and saw some incredible sights. I saw an octopus, a sea cucumber, held a sea urchin and more. The plant life is like another world under water. I felt like I was in the middle of a National Geographic special.   Another exciting thing was the hiking along the cliffs of the sea. I had brought some good hiking sandals and just had to check out all those trails. I hiked for about an hour to a castle and found a restaurant at the top. I saw two ladies who must have been 75 years old if not older. They had also hiked up to the restaurant and at 10am were enjoying their first beer of the day. I decided that I liked their spirit and have decided Iâ€™ll be doing the same when I get to be their age. It was inspiring.   We enjoyed the nightlife, sort of. I know you probably think we were party animals, but somehow all that sun took the party right out of us. But we did try at least once. We had dinner then went out to the walking area. No cars are allowed in this area and it is fun to just walk around and see the shops, restaurants and people. The specialty of this area is Sangria so, of course, we had to partake in the culture. We then decided to go into a pub. We found one that was an English pub. We thought it would be fun and refreshing to hear a bit of English. As I mentioned above, Germans come to Mallorca for months at a time and so most vendors speak Spanish and German and not much English. We were ready to be able to understand something if only for an hour or two. We walked into this pub and it was filled with Brits, Irish people and Germans. There wasnâ€™t an American to be found, not even a Canadian was there. So we were listening to the DJ and after a bit, we all looked at each other with question marks all over our faces. I finally burst out with, â€œI know heâ€™s speaking English, but I have no idea what he just said!â€ The others agreed and we just laughed it off, had another Sangria and went home. If thatâ€™s a party animal, then I am oneïŠ   "

Should I back it back for a free bet. Decide not to. After all I am disciplined. Favourite wins. I am down Â£19. Next race decide to try to get this back plus Â£10. Lay short-priced favourite that drifts. Should I back back for free bet and no risk? No I decide. Favourite wins. I am now down around Â£80. Decide to lay the next short-priced favourite. It drifts. Should I back it back for free bet and no risk? No. The same pattern can't happen three times in a row can it? It does. Am now down Â£138. Draw down Â£200 from credit card. I am going to get this cash back. Lay next short-priced favourite. It shortens further- dramatically further. Everyone wants to get on this horse. I resign myself to losing another Â£258 as this now is my libility if I want to win back my previous losses with Â£15 extra. It loses!! Up a paltry Â£12 after credit costs taken into account. 
31257,3826242,"21,July,2004",2004-07-21,   The nature of reality often comes into mind. The greatest mystery being why is there anything rather than nothing? I've come to the conclusion that God dissolved himself aeons ago into the fabric of the cosmos so that He could experience true liberation. After all if you control everything how can you be free? The universe now progresses along its evolutionary path according to certain basic physical laws. We experience them. We are the echoes or pieces of the original divine conciousness. Besides having cosmic thought s I am walking the Ulster Way- a 600 mile or so path around the north of Ireland. I will post the odd picture of my  travels 
31258,3826242,"19,July,2004",2004-07-19,   Just returned from a trip to the West with The Beloved and her daughter. Called in with the Daughter's father in Barna Co. Galway. He took her for the day so myself and Liz did a little touring around Oughterard and the lovely Lough Corrib. Ended up camping in a remote spot by the lake that night near Glann.&nbsp; Just the sound of fighting terns from a little islet offshore. In the morning a swim in the soft lake water - alright it took me about ten minutes to immerse myself! My expressions were somewhat gargoyle -like. but once I was in it was bliss. Next day we set off&nbsp; for Kerry to try for the second time to get to Skellig Michael.  urlLink http://whc.unesco.org/pg.cfm?cid=31&amp;id_site=757 &nbsp;Skellig is a rocky island off the coast which was inhabited by monks from around 400 AD. It has no springs and very little greenery. The perfect place for a monk to escape the pressures of 6th Century life. It's bloody hard to get to. the conditions have to be just right before the boatmen will venture out. Last Friday was not the day. We arrived as low fog shrouded the islands and surrounding hills creating bizarre mysterious cloudshapes - the 'teasing mists of Skelligs' - perhaps I'll write a song! Next day we headed north to visit friends on the island of Inisbofin. Neither myself or Liz had been on the island before. The sun was splitting the trees as we headed off from Cleggan (perfect weather to land on Skellig!). Cars have to be left behind. The islanders have managed to bring a few battered wrecks onto the island where there's no road tax. On the island we feasted on the most beautiful leg of lamb - bought from a butchers in Clifden - beside the Celtic Shop. A local fisherman left a few mackerel which we fried in butter and smeared with harissa and soy sauce. Delicious!!!! Next day we lounged on the East Side beach - I roasted my balding pate. It's now a kind of pinky purply colour. Long drive back to Belfast where we learned that one of Liz's erswhile mates had died of liver failure at the age of 38. North Belfast is a place of tragedy. Liz went to another funeral today of a woman in her early 40s - the mother of 7 kids who committed suicide last week. One of her sons had killed himself last year. 
31259,3826242,"02,July,2004",2004-07-02,   2nd July 2004 What does a gambling Buddhist put in a post? Can there be such a thing as a gambling Buddhist. Am I a Buddhist? I attend a sangha here in rainy Belfast on Tuesdays and sometimes Sundays. At the zendo we sit in silence for 30 minutes then walk in silence for ten minutes then meditate again for 45 minutes. On Fridays usually I gamble and lose quite a lot of money. Today I didn't lose. I actually made Â£14. Last week I lost Â£345. As a Buddhist I see my gambling as 'grasping'. - chasing after an illusion that cannot ever bring real happiness. What it does bring is momentary gratification. Like any addiction it gives the illusion of power for a few moments before inevitably reality sinks in. Throughout the lifetime of this blog I'll try to give an insight into the mind of a gambler albeit one who wishes he could lead an 'alternative' life. 
31260,3826242,"02,August,2004",2004-08-02,"   Continued along the Ulster Way yesterday - a 600 odd mile traipse around the north of Ireland. A fine evening found us up Shanes Hill Road at Ballyboley Forest. Through a bunch of spruce trees and over a stile or two to a vantage point overlooking Larne. The last time we were up here we could see as far as Scotland to the north-east, the Mournes to the south with a hint of the Isle of man on the horizon and to the west Slemish and the Sperrins and of course Lough Neagh our inland sea. This evening though we had haze - whether pollution or innoccuous heat haze or a mixture of both I don't know. Every month here seems to have a dominant colour. In May the yellow gorse or whin dominates. This month its the purple of the heather and the thistle. The darker bell heather mixes in with the lighter type of heather ( I can't remember the technical term!) I picked blueberries. I never realised they were so common here. My memories of blueberries focus round Norwegian forests where on rare visits as children we coloured our hands and faces purple with the juice. We walked over to the cairned top of Agnews Hill and decided to stop there as the sun was declining rapidly. Walking back we watched as the sun set directly over  urlLink Slemish - St Patrick's Hill. White moths fluttered around us as we made our way back to the car. Black slugs began their dusk feeding. Today I completed the stetch of the walk with Tess, my sisters dog. I drove up the lonely and desolate Starbog Road past the quarry where a couple of years ago a local man was pulled into the crushing machine and killed. Tess had to be lifted over the stiles but frolicked madly in the soft mossy grass. We saw frogs. The weather was misty but warm- no spectacular sunsets this evening! "

24298,3835812,"20,July,2004",2004-07-20,"   Almost everything I know about how to live, I learned in my music theory class. Yes, you can learn serious stuff in music theory. The most notable lesson I learned is when to break the rules. You know, I was a good kid....I just wanted to stay out of trouble. I did what I was supposed to do and didn't break too many rules. Rules were big to me, but I learned that you can't camp on rules...you quit living! Here's the deal: Everyone needs to learn the rules. Rules about life, social rules, music rules. It's the foundation! But once you know them it is critical that you learn when and how to break them. I had a professor who liked to tell us, ""you have to earn rubato!"" Rubato is when you stretch a note, or shorten or change a note. His point was you have to know the music well before you can do these things. This applies to all kinds of areas of life. Even Jesus taught it. He went to the religious leaders and told them they had distorted the commandments...they needed to learn the principles behind them....they even needed to learn to break a few. you aren't living if you aren't breaking a few rules and breaking them well.

24299,3835812,"19,July,2004",2004-07-19,"   That's the trouble. Here I am at the stage of life that I should be thinking of retiring and just being a grammie and doing the things I've always dreamed of. Oh well, I am going to school instead. I have felt for a long time that I would eventually go back, but I waited for the right motivation. When my good friend died earlier this year I realized what I wanted to do. Social Work. I felt like standing next to her bed holding her hand and just being there for her was exactly where I was supposed to be. I remember how many times she told me to follow my path...even if I had to go back to school. She said that women often don't reach their full potential. I was encouraged by her words. She sure reached her potential. I don't know when I have experienced a death that has left so many people with a hole in their hearts. She was amazing and loved everyone around her....yeah, I want to do Social Work. I guess I better go study....   "

I think blogging is a great way to share thoughts, ideas, musings, etc. so I didn't think much about reading my kid's. It's nice to experience them as adults who have their own thoughts and things to say. Who knows when they will teach me something valuable? Around the dinner table it is difficult to keep a good intellectual conversation going, but on a blog it is easier. Is it a violation of privacy to read your family's blogs????   How about: I'll show you mine if you show me yours??  Love, Mom   "

Nxt week Saturday going up to Arizona&nbsp; (Spore's Sunday) and I'm looking forward to the trip...Anyway I'm going to sleep now...kinda got sleepy through all the excitement...ì•ˆë…•!"
13057,3835889,"23,July,2004",2004-07-23,   I woke up this morning v early...To play GB! Lolxz man its a damn fun game and I earn lots of GP today. Anyway I also got nothing to do so I hav lots of time to play the game. Yep that's right I am very free until I can come online everyday to add all these blogs. Hahaxz. Its the same day no different like any other day...juz lazing around the house that's all.  &nbsp;    Its so damn boring that I don't even feel like typing all these blogs. Kinda getting sick of coming here to type all these thingy...Hmm maybe I shld not be coming here everyday to send my blogs bahxz. Anyway me juz had a thick red wine so I'm gonna go sleep now...Buaixz Buaixz
13058,3835889,"22,July,2004",2004-07-22,"   Oh man time really passes so quickly...My school is gonna start soon and I am getting kinda nervous. I guess it will be a total whole new experience and friendships when I start school. Anyway I juz realized today that...Its almost the end of July already! I have been here in Tucson for more than 1 mth already! Wow...I do wonder how my friends back in Spore are doin...  &nbsp;    Anyway, its really a boring day and I realli dunno what else to do except playing GB. Yep I juz got promoted again, thxs to the hard work of playing everytime. I guess when school starts, I will not hav much time playing GB already. Hahaxz anyway I passed my driving today already so I'm free to go...But still muz practice more on parking the car, though I did relatively well...Lolxz better not 'kua' myself too much or else get a bloated head. Anyway its kinda boring typing all these stuff too, and I'm oso getting impatient waiting for my mails from my friends. Argh god knows when will they be arriving...I'm gonna go sleep now after drinking some wine. *Yawnz* (-_-) good night...."
13059,3835889,"21,July,2004",2004-07-21,"   Today is my birthday! hahaxz I received quite a number of e cards, but was slightly disappointed when some of my best friends forgets abt it...hahaxz anyway, its being a tiring day. Know why I said that? Well first when I went for my driving lessons at 9am, the instructor pulled off a stunt on me and force me into I-10 ( A highway similar to Spore expressway, but muz move at a faster speed). I got the hell out of my life as I have to speed up to 75mph (abt 120km/h) but I onli managed to push the car to 72mph (114km/h) and boy, this sure is the first time that I drove a vehicle at such high speed. Wow man it sure is a totally new experience for me. And tomorrow it will be my final lessons, and I will get my graduated license whereby I can drive alone without anybody sitting beside me...     I was so bored that I played GB after my lessons...Then I didn't know what to do nxt so I went to the gym...That made me even more tiring...Well I had a birthday dinner wif my family at church's chicken ( something like KFC) and then head back home after that. Watched independence day on TV, then come online to type this stupid blog...hahaxz guess I was so tired that I need to sleep liaoxz...Happy 17th Birthday to Me!~ (^U^)"
13060,3835889,"20,July,2004",2004-07-20,"   Lolxz 1 more day and it will be my birthday liaoxz! Anyway if u all still don't know, my birthday actually falls on racial harmony day as well as international friendship day...Hahaxz my friends out there, i dun mind abt having any presents anot but i do think that the most important thing for a true birthday present is sincerity. Without it, giving a present is oso useless.     Anyway, today has&nbsp;being a great day...its my dads birthday! Lol and i drove every1 out for brunch together ( breakfast and lunch together). Actually i got nothing much to say abt today 'cause its a sloooow moving day. Kinda bored actually. Guess the best part of everything was that i got 2 bottles of Loreal Paris products for free! Hahaxz its actually because the cashier made a mistake charging my product, which is US$8.09 each and has to refund me $17+ back, as well as&nbsp;giving me the&nbsp;products FOC! Hahaxz this is the system in US. If they make a mistake, they will hav to give the products to us, FOC as well as refund the full amount of money. The reason is simple: we can actually sue them for charging us the wrong price.&nbsp;That means&nbsp;if i bought a bike here and was charged wrongly, they will hav to refund me and give me the bike FOC!&nbsp;Lol i do love US...hahaxz.Btw i hav to sleep soon, 'cause tomorrow early morning i will be having my 3rd and 4th driving lessons...Good night everybody!"
13061,3835889,"19,July,2004",2004-07-19,"   Wow time passes realli quickly...2 more days and i will be going for my nxt driving lessons, as well as my birthday! Hmm but i guess this year my birthday will be very lonely. The first year which i hav to spend my birthday alone without my friends...especially my close friends ( Hey guys dun be mistaken...the gurl i mentioned in my previous entry 'Weird Feelings' is my closest friend, not my gf!). I guess this year i wouldn't be getting any birthday presents from my friends in Spore. But anyway its alright 'cause its the thought that counts. Its the sincere well wishes that tells me my friends still care abt me...   &nbsp;   I realli do not know what to write anymore, but i do hav something i want to say to Wanyi, my good friend: I am always there for you, whenever you need me, wherever i might be. What ever happens, i will always stand by your side. In life, there will be ups and downs, and its up to you to overcome it. I might be there for you, but all i can do is to give you advise, and the rest is up to you. Hmm i guess i'm getting too emotional with her...Lolxz emotional as in close friendship! Anyway gtg hav dinner right now, then watch WWE raw life..."
13062,3835889,"18,July,2004",2004-07-18,"   Lolxz man today was a great day man...Nothing to do in the morning 'cause so bored...Watched a movie on TV titled Ocean's 11, went out to walmart and the post office&nbsp;with my family ( with me driving the car of course! Lolxz!) bought tons of rubbish, then came home and had dinner with my back home food...Curry! Was that delicious or what? If that wasn't enough, we invited our neighbours to our house, and then had a few drinks! Then with me gulping down 4 glasses of red wine and going with crackers, popcorn and tibits, I had to sleep soon...Lolxz sry arxz 'cause me now slightly goggy liaoxz...Lolxz...   &nbsp;   Anyway everything went great for these past 2 days...Had no chance to post my entries yesterday 'cause there was a heavy thunderstorm and had to risk a blackout...Man it was exciting...*giggles* and&nbsp; not only that, I had to reboot my computer yesterday too 'cause I need to install my new Norton antivirus Pro and my windows dun allow it. Anyway me too luo suo liaoxz...hahaxz...Me now miss my friends, especially my&nbsp;good friend Wanyi! Lolxz me getting siao siao liaoxz...Anyway Wanyi,&nbsp;dun be too surprise to c your name here arxz...'cause I really do misses you and your e mails! Lolxz...I guess I really had to go liaoxz 'cause me really damn tired...Buaixz Buaixz (^_^)"
13063,3835889,"16,July,2004",2004-07-16,"   Today went for driving lessons again...My second lesson and was on a busie road...kinda scary at first but when&nbsp;I got use to it, it was kinda fun...But the worst thing was that when&nbsp;I passed a police car, I was speeding at 60mph! Lolxz can you imagine that? Luckily&nbsp;I was not caught because the patrol car was busie on other things...Anyway&nbsp;I can't&nbsp; wait for the nxt lesson, which is on my birthday, 21st July...And some more it is a double lesson! And the nxt day 22nd July, I will be able to get my graduated license, whereby I can drive alone on the road! Wow...Can't wait man...   &nbsp;   Anyway when&nbsp;I got back home,&nbsp;I was slightly tired. But my dad wanted me to drive my whole family&nbsp;to a post office which is a few miles away...Boy was&nbsp;I exhausted when&nbsp;I got home. I sure is looking forward to another driving lesson, and my new car...Toyota Camry LE...Sure I do...As I never had the chance to own a car back in Spore...Anyway its getting late and I'm quite tired, so I'm gonna rest now...*Yawnz*   (-_-)"
13064,3835889,"15,July,2004",2004-07-15,"   I kinda miss my friends back in Spore, even until now... however there was 1 particular close friend which I had, and I will never forget her. I don't understand why I was pretty attached to her, and sometimes I still had that kind of feeling I had back then at the Spore Changi Airport.&nbsp; Today, she was back in my mind again...She stayed with me throughout my chalet back then in April 04 and we had some really great time together. I still remembered that we had pillow fights in the room...We brushed teeth together...Toast mashmallows together...Those were the fondest memories I had.&nbsp; Whenever I am feeling down, she will always be there for me... How I wish I could&nbsp;express to&nbsp;her how I feel all along...   &nbsp;    She kept me wondering why I had&nbsp;the heart to leave her behind...Even if&nbsp;the gurl I liked ask me to stay, I won't...But if she persuade me instead, I might stay behind and let go all my dreams of&nbsp;furthering&nbsp;my studies...I guess that's y friendship is the most important. Without that special person in your life, you might not know how to get on with it...I guess that's y even when I had something to tell her before I left, I didn't say though...But its all in my heart...And 1 day, I will let her know how I feel...I do miss her alot........"
13065,3835889,"14,July,2004",2004-07-14,"   Its the most exciting time i had today...I can't believe it man...I really did drive for the first time in my life on this day! Although this is my first driving lesson, i had already started driving on the road...Guess why? Hahaxz its bcause the driving lessons here in US starts on any road, particularly anywhere. Unlike Spore, driving can only be learned in a driving school...and so unlimited..   &nbsp;  It all started in the residential area, where the traffic is v light. The instructor taught me to accelerate and many other things which includes using the brakes, the mirrors etc etc...Me n my mum learnt together and i started to lose control when i first drove...nearly went head on into a bush...hahaxz i was slightly nervous mahxz no choice. But everything went on smoothly after that...then it was my Mum's turn...she almost rammed into a dustbin! Lolxz but no choice mahxz all beginner. However when the lesson was over, the instructor offered me to drive him and my mum home! I was kinda surprise but still went ahead. This was also the first time which i went into a heavy traffic which was kinda like a route which many ppl used...and boy was i glad that i made it home *phew...* Lolxz...I parked the car (anyhow) after that....It was damn interesting man...  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"
31094,3847790,"16,July,2004",2004-07-16,"   Okay 8 hours of sleep after 40 hours without does not even come close to making things better.&nbsp; I woke up today wanting to kill someone.&nbsp; That subsided with a large&nbsp;infusion of coffee and a chocolate hedgehog, all before 7:30 this morning.&nbsp; Chocolate makes my world alright. &nbsp; Kes was in a tizzy last night when I got back from visiting the ""Little Prince"" (or as I like to call him, ""the infant formerly known as Dane"").&nbsp; I'm not sure what happens when I am in the house, but I think Doug slips her caffeine or sugar.&nbsp; I took her to bed with me rather than try to fight her to sleep and put her in her crib.&nbsp; She flopped around, sat up, laid down, smashed my face with her head, kicked me, tried to crawl out.&nbsp; I was rapidly slipping into unconsiousness and wound up just hanging onto her ankle for dear life, hoping that I would either stop her from falling out of bed, or that there would be enough velocity to pull me along with her if she did, thereby waking me up.&nbsp; But blessedly, she crashed (to sleep).&nbsp; I seem to recall a middle of the night episode where she kicked Doug in the head, but since I was not the one feeling the pain, I went back to sleep! &nbsp; I can't wait until there is  another  baby in the bed with us!&nbsp; Maybe we should just pad the entire room with foam rubber and mattresses. &nbsp; At any rate, all I can think about now is more sleep and maybe making an offering to the Goddess of Toddler Sleep that Kes will sleep in this weekend! &nbsp; Good night!  "
31095,3847790,"15,July,2004",2004-07-15,"   So I have had exactly one hour of sleep since 6:00am yesterday morning.&nbsp; Why? you ask.&nbsp; Because my beautiful twin sister Cathy gave birth to a healthy baby boy this morning at 5:58am.&nbsp; His name is Dane Ryder Shewchuk, he weighs in at 8lbs. 10oz. and is 22"" long.&nbsp; The birth went so well and I am completely euphoric and on a total high (well, okay - a large Seattle's Best creme brulee latte has helped.&nbsp; And a Coke.)&nbsp; My sister rocks.&nbsp; She is a goddess.&nbsp; I am in awe.  "
31096,3847790,"14,July,2004",2004-07-14,"   In explanation of my obscure reference above, I am referring to the pincers on a crab, as opposed to the stinger of a scorpion. The story goes thus:   Yesterday I was off work on a sick day and decided to take Kestrel to daycare even though I was home. After a brief moment of intense guilt, I dropped her off and she was happy to go as I think it's like perpetual Disneyland there, where they sing and play all day and let her do whatever she wants.   I picked her up at the end of the day and she and I were hanging out waiting for Doug to get home. It was just the two of us as Hannah is camping with my parents right now (love them). I was sitting there watching t.v., minding my own business and Kes was hanging around my legs, when suddenly I felt her hand on the bare skin of my leg, just below where my shorts end. I thought to myself ""she's not gonna....."" and before I completed the thought, she had pinched a very tiny piece of my skin between her fingers in what felt like the grip of a fully grown pro wrestler. As I was screaming ""OW!"" at the top of my lungs, several thoughts flew through my head ""pinch her back? punt her across the room? drop-kick her?"" Intense pain has a way of bringing out the violence in me. Luckily for all concerned, the loud scream on my part startled her enough and after she gave me a look of disdain, she cried. We comforted each other and when I revealed to her the mark she left behind (I bruise like a peach), she gave me several loud and sloppy kisses somewhere in the vicinty of the wound.   Not only that, we can now add biting to the list of defenses she has. We purchased a Little Tykes climbing apparatus with a slide from a friend and she loves it. When I tried to take her off of it, however, she bit me. Same scenario, me thinking ""she's not gonna....."" and then boom it happens! Perhaps this should be my alarm bell from now on? DON'T GIVE HER THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT!""  "
31097,3847790,"10,July,2004",2004-07-10,"   So for those of you who have witnessed ""nursemaid's elbow"", you all understand the horror of seeing your little one in extreme pain.  For the second time, we have had Kestrel up at the hospital to have it ""reduced"" as they call it.  For those of you who don't know what it is:  it's a subluxation of the radial head and got it's name from nannies who used to ""snap"" their charges along behnd them, and in doing so pulled their elbows out.  The most common ways it occurs today is by picking up child by the forearms or wrists, swinging them by the arms or doing the ""helicopter"" (one arm, one leg), the child hanging off of something and letting go with one arm, or by an adult grabbing the arm to rescue the child from falling, etc.  It instantly causes extreme pain and loss of the use of the arm.  An older child may say the pain is in either their shoulder or their wrist and it tends to radiate either way.  Once the elbow is put back in, the pain is instantly gone and the child resumes use of the arm as though nothing ever happened.  It is extremely common and I don't think it is often connected to abuse by professionals unless you are coming in all the time with it.  The first time it happened it was simple, go to the hospital, wait three or four hours, get it fixed.  They fix it by rotating the lower arm to palm up position and then folding the arm all the way up until they feel it click.  It hurts like hell at the time, but like I say, it stops immediately.  We aren't sure how it happened, Hannah and I were in the kitchen and I think she probably hung off the baby gate.  The second time it occured at daycare and since there is somewhat of a language barrier (they are from India), we were not able to determine exactly happened.  I might point out that they absolutely worship Kes and would tell us if they knew.  I believe she was most likely hanging again as she is a complete primate.  I decided this time that I didn't want to go all the way to Children's Hospital and demanded that we go to the clinic instead.  After a two hour wait there, the doctor told us he didn't want to touch her and we should go back to the hospital.  Doug was so pissed, as was I because every doctor in the world knows how to fix this.  We ran home to give her some food as she had not had dinner yet and I took her to Children's myself.  Two hours later two doctors tried to fix it and it did not seem to work.  Neither of them felt it click and Kes was absolutely apoplectic by this time.  But as she began to use the arm a little, they let us leave and said to come back if she was still not using it in the morning.  All night she tried to turn onto her right side, would get part way, cry and roll back.  It was heart-breaking.  At one point I helped her get over because she likes to sleep on her right.  The next morning I left Doug a note to call me at work when he got up.  She was still not using it and was complaining (""OW!""), so he came and got me and we went back up.  This time they x-rayed it to make sure there wan't a fracture or something.  But they determined that it was still the elbow and this time time the doctor got it back in.  Right away she started using the arm and all was well.  Poor Doug just can't handle these episodes, so I have to try and be the strong one.  I can't imagine what he will be like the first time there is blood or worse, a broken bone.  It won't be pretty!  One thing I note is that losing one arm did not slow her down much.  While all the little sick Chinese kids sat placidly in the Emergency waiting room, Kes ripped around trying to escape via the automatic sliding doors, screaming at the kids who were playing with the toys she wanted and finding the one electrical socket in the room.  I did not sit down for the entire two hours and was exhausted.  I just know that this will be my ""grey-hair"" kid.....  "
31098,3847790,"07,July,2004",2004-07-07,"   n.   1     Chem. & Minerology   crystallization in two or more fundamentally different forms.    2     Biol.   the exhibiting of different forms at different stages of the life cycle.    3   the condition of a tumour containing a mixture of several cell types and different types of neoplastic tissue.  With the exception of the third definition, I have to say that I have been feeling very much like the above.  I know there are women out there who can balance family and work and every other activity they engage in.  Not me.  I feel like I am always having to pleomorph (see definition two) in order to just stay on top of things.  Hence why I often fantasize about being somewhere in the south of France with a glass of the region's finest in one hand and a great novel in the other, while the au pere looks after the children.  But of course this is Oprah Winfrey's life, or Julia Roberts' or Cameron Diaz' (if they had children). Okay, I know Julia is going to have two at once, but who WON'T she hire to help out?  All I know is that I ache for my little ""Pootie"" and my big ""Mookie"" when I am not with them and one day it won't have to be so.  Even if I do suffer daily abuse from the former and would spend most of my time telling the latter to ""turn down that godawful noise""!  Well, maybe I won't channel some fishwife, but you get the drift.  I need, no crave, those rare hugs that Kestrel deigns to bestow on me when she feels it might gain her some leverage in the bedtime negotiations.  And I want them all the time.  Is that really so much to ask?  "
31099,3847790,"06,July,2004",2004-07-06,   Oy.  Now Doug thinks she is allergic to chicken.  Oy.  
31100,3847790,"05,July,2004",2004-07-05,"   So inexplicably, Kestrel begins to break out in hives over her entire body for the last three days.  What do you do when that happens?  Well, when you are my husband, you blame any and all foods (all of which she has been eating for six months or more with no reaction), you blame her bedding (which she has been sleeping on for the exact same amount of time) and then you begin reaching at straws: grass?  cleansers?  detergents?  We manage to narrow it down to the nasty rug in our living room that she lays on and rubs her soother on.  We remove the rug and Doug goes on a mad clean-up of the house; stirring up more dust than in The Mummy, in turn triggering MY allergies to go beserk.  Then he declares that we clean all pillows, which by the time I am ready for bed are not anywhere near dry.  No restful night for me.  I can only hope that the rug was the culprit because I cannot stand much more of his paranoia.  Add to that the fact that he can't get Benadryl and Benylin straight (one being an antihistamine and the other being a cough formula) and I may very well go mad.  The only saving fact in all of this is that Kestrel seems mainly unaffected by her bout with hives and manages to torment us in between by being an angel intermittently as per normal.  And I want another child?  Yes.  While I know that it will be hell and I will be stressed out and tired, I know there will also be those great moments that are irreplacable.  And the fact of the matter is that they DO grow up eventually as displayed by my almost 13-year-old.  She's all legs and boobs, which brings on a whole new set of worries, but let's not go there.  I have one excellent card to play when things get tough.  And that is that Nanny (my mom) is but a phone call away!  Couple that with the fact that I intend to keep my daycare in my employ for at least two days a week once off again and I should be able to fumble through!  "
31101,3847790,"05,July,2004",2004-07-05,"   Heaven and Hell.  Ah yes, well there you have it, don't you?  A day in the life of my 19 month old.  These days are very top heavy with ""NO!"" and ""DON'T!"" and ""STOP IT!""  Combine that with the fact that she can now defend herself with slapping, kicking, head-butting, pinching and grabbing and you've pretty much filled a day!  But in spite of her apparent flaws (faulty genes no doubt contributed by her father), I love every square inch of her!  I did not imagine for one moment that I would end up with a strawberry blond, blue-eyed child.  Especially since my other daughter is brunette and brown-eyed like me!  I cannot stop looking at her without wanting to kiss her, much to her disgust.  There have been times where I wanted to literally absorb her; put her back into me so I could have her with me at all times.  And how can I not almost cry when I ask her a question and she responds ""Okay"", except that it comes out like ""Okee"", not unlike the way my Australian (second) Dad would say it!  Or when she stands at the fridge and says ""cheeeeeese"".  Or when she suddenly comes out with a complete sentence: ""it's very hot"".  Sigh.  To love them and not love them at the same time - the eternal parental conflict!  And I don't want to use the word hate because it just simply is not true, but I have been known to use the term ""little bugger"" in relation to her!  Of course, it's at that very moment that she throws her arms around me and plants a big ""mwah"" on my face!  "
31102,3847790,"08,August,2004",2004-08-08,"   It has been some time since I did an entry and here's why:  We made a ten day trip to Montreal and I was involved in the preparation for departure, the actual trip and then the return with a three hour time difference.  The five hour flight each way went well, but here's where I get to shatter your image of me as a mother.  The thought of having a willful, screaming toddler inside of a large metal box on wings 30,000 feet in the air was a bit more than I could bear, so (head hangs in shame) I drugged her.  I gave her Gravol.  Now, we had timed our flights for early morning and late evening to increase chances of her sleeping, but felt that extra insurance was needed.  Those of you who have toddlers know that they WILL adjust their cycles purely for the benefit of tormenting you.  She has never shown any inclination towards motion sickness and she has travelled by air before (she wasn't quite mobile then), but I figured why leave it to the fates?  The one thing that we noticed right away was how compliant Gravol made her once she had woken up.  Don't think that it hasn't occurred to me to put this great substance to other use since then, but I have refrained (ha ha, of course I would never!  All I have to do is think of my mother telling me about all the kids that were stoned on Phenergan ""back in the day"").  Montreal was very hot and humid, but enjoyable.  We had visits with Doug's parents and our friends, who while we were there, got the great news that there is a baby waiting for them in China!  It was really wonderful to be a part of that.  I got some great fabric for my baby blanket business that I am starting and can't wait to get sewing!  (P.S.  if anyone wants info on that, you can email me)  We got to see the Jean Cocteau exhibit at the Fine Arts Museum, or rather La Musee des Beaux Arts and it was really good.  Except for the nasty security lady telling me to not touch the glass that was OVER the artwork (and the purpose of the glass is.....?)  I mean if I was touching a PAINTING, then you can say something, but jeez, pass me the Windex and I'll remove my fingerprint IMMEDIATELY!  Anyway, we also got to the Contemporary Art Museum and that was good.  I get saturated by art fairly quickly, and wouldn't really make a good student of art, but I DO enjoy it.  Did that make any sense?  So that was that.  Now that I have returned and reviewed my blog, I realize that it could come across as fairly negative and I try to do it in a humourous light, but let's face it - raising kids is damn hard work and there is a lot of stress, especially if you a) like your sleep; b) like your stuff; c) like your space.  But one thing I have to point out is that the good far outweighs the bad, hands down.  My kid could wake up at 4:00 am, puke on me, poop on me, hit me and so on, but all she has to do is her Steve Erkel imitation and all of that stuff is erased!  Top that with an unsolicited hug or kiss and I am a puddle on the floor!  I thought I would take this opportunity to list some of Kestrel's milestones to date.  She is approximately 25 pounds, 30-32 inches tall, has just moved into the 18-24 month size at Gymboree and Old Navy (my markers for her growth!) and wears a size five shoe (finally - midget feet!)  Thanks to her dad's genes, she is exactly average on the growth charts, which pleases me to no end.  Hannah was so much bigger and since I am a whole lot older this time around, I am happy to have a smallish child.  To compare, Hannah was 9lbs. 3oz. and Kes was 7lbs. 4 oz. at birth.  Hannah looked three months old when she was born and when Kes arrived, all I could say was ""she's so tiny!""  But I am getting sidetracked!  Kes' language surprises me every day.  She comes out with words that I don't recall teaching her which leads me to believe that she is just soaking it all up!  When she first started saying words (around 9 months), she started with (in my opinion) two-word sentences, although I am sure professionals would dispute that with me.  Within a very short time span, she could say:  Hi Dad, all gone, all done, bye-bye, uh-oh.  Now her vocabulary has increased and even though she mostly speaks only one word at a time, she'll surprise me occasionally with things like ""Oh, it's pretty"" and ""This is yummy"" and ""Where's Hannah?""  I notice as she learns new words, she'll forget about others as though her brain is saying ""yeah, yeah, I already know that one - leave me alone!"" and she has her own special words for a few things, which I would like to list:  Annie = Auntie Dougie = Daddy (she alternates between them, as Hannah calls him the same name) Pubby = puppy (she does say this one right from time to time) Ubby and Uppy = Up (self-explanatory) Th-th-theeeeeeee = Soothie (her pacifier)(aside:  French word for it:  ""susse"" (say ""soose"") Oh shbee! = Oh it's pretty (she says it the right way now, so this is an oldie - took forever to figure that one out, btw) and my personal favorite: Bob-Bob = Spongebob  I am sure there are many more, which I will try to add as I go.  She is just so darned cute and funny right now!  Anywho - will end this one for now.  Ta!  "

13066,3851365,"19,July,2004",2004-07-19,"   Wendy and I went to Dr. Vic today. (psychotherapist)&nbsp; She went in first, then I went in.&nbsp; Dr. Vic said that Wendy's bad feelings have definitely intensified.&nbsp; He said she blames me for everything that is wrong with her.&nbsp; This was a terrible shock to me, as Wendy often tells me, ""You're the best mother in the world.""&nbsp; So which is it?&nbsp; He also said that I should not live&nbsp;in fear, and that Wendy's problems were bigger than either of us could handle or assess.&nbsp; He did not know what level of threat she presented.&nbsp; I had told him that Wendy was talking more and more often about getting so angry that she wanted to kill people.&nbsp; I don't know if this is a figure of speech or whether she would actually do it.&nbsp; And this is a horrible place for a mother to be.&nbsp; I am afraid of what is going on inside her brain. &nbsp; Dr. Vic told me that I must find a psychiatric social worker to assess whether Wendy could continue to live at home.&nbsp; I never even knew there were psychiatric social workers, nor where to find one.&nbsp; So tomorrow I have to start making calls.&nbsp; Craig said to start with calling Dr. S. (our psychiatrist)&nbsp; But ... what if someone tells me that she has to live somewhere else?&nbsp; Wendy would be miserable.&nbsp; She wants to stay at home with us.&nbsp; Dr. Vic said how do I know she will be miserable?&nbsp; What if she enjoys the structure and company? &nbsp; And where will we get the money? &nbsp; Craig has to go to court next Tuesday.&nbsp; His f***ing ex-wife is suing us again.&nbsp; Increased child support for Leo (because she lost her job, and supposedly can't find a new one) and resumed child support for Ariel, who moved back in with her.&nbsp; Apparently it doesn't matter to her that the MSA specifies that child support is to end when a child drops out of college (as Ariel did, when she was living with her 34-year-old boyfriend).&nbsp; I guess Ariel resumes being a child when she moves back in with her mother and goes back to community college.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Even though Craig says this is a cut-and-dried case (in our favor), I am still terrified about the outcome, because the first time we went to court, we lost, because the judge was an idiot, and ruled that it was okay for the witch's boyfriend to live in the house that we were paying for (via alimony and child support) because she ""wasn't aware"" that the situation would affect these payments, even though the MSA spelled it out.&nbsp; In other words, ignorance IS an excuse for breaking the law. &nbsp; Saw ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" tonight and cried.  "
13067,3851365,"17,July,2004",2004-07-17,"   Had a comparably relaxing two days.&nbsp; Even pleasant.&nbsp; Last month I had entered a screenwriting competition in which entrants were randomly assigned a genre and subject, and had exactly one week to write a 20-page (or less) script.&nbsp; Last Saturday the genres/subjects were posted to the competition's web site, and today was the deadline to postmark the entry.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  My genre was ""comedy"" and subject was ""plastic surgery"".&nbsp; Craig suggested that I use my idea for the sexist guy who goes into the hospital for a vasectomy, and is accidentally given a sex change operation.&nbsp; I originally planned to write this as a feature-length script (and had written the first act several months ago), so the trick was to come up with an ending within 20 pages.&nbsp; Using a lot of what I already had, I was able to pound out the first 16 pages last Sunday.&nbsp; Today I finally had an epiphany about the ending, and finished by 6:30 tonight.&nbsp; So who knows, I might win something.&nbsp; There are only 11 contestants in my category.&nbsp; I figure writer's block and bad writing will rule out most of the other 10.&nbsp; Based on the screenwriting competition I used to direct, 99% of what people write is garbage.  &nbsp;  I had a pleasant lunch today with Jim K., former student (from 18 years ago!) and his new girlfriend.&nbsp; Somehow he tracked me down using Google and a search for ""Lisa Wendy Shelby"".&nbsp; I was a little apprehensive about how I would look so much older than the cute youthful teacher he remembered, but thought, 'What the heck, he's 18 years older too.'&nbsp; Well, I was delighted when I walked into the restaurant and he hugged me and said, ""Lisa, you look exactly the same.""&nbsp; Actually, he looked pretty much the same too, although much cuter than I remembered.&nbsp; And a doctor, no less.  &nbsp;  The conversation was a little awkward as I was trying to pull his girlfriend into the conversation, but she didn't have much to contribute.&nbsp; I hope she didn't notice that Jim was pretty much staring at me the whole time.&nbsp; He had that same bemused little smile that Rick used to get whenever he watched me.&nbsp; So okay,&nbsp;Jim must have had a big crush on me and maybe still does.&nbsp;&nbsp; When his girlfriend got up to go to the bathroom for the second time, I realized I'd better&nbsp;make my exit so they could continue their romantic weekend&nbsp;alone.&nbsp; Either that, or she has a weak bladder.&nbsp; Anyway, I was gratified to be, for exactly two hours today, the object of someone's long-term admiration.&nbsp; (well, besides Craig's)&nbsp; I of course immediately called Craig afterward and informed him that his wife's former student still had eyes for her, and he assured me that he was well aware of having such a good-looking wife.&nbsp;&nbsp; All together now:&nbsp; Awwwwww.  "
13068,3851365,"15,July,2004",2004-07-15,"   Back in San Diego after four days in Las Vegas with Wendy, Shelby, and Esen.&nbsp; When you go on a trip with kids (that including teenagers), it is not so much a vacation as a field trip.&nbsp; They still need to be organized, fed, and entertained round the clock.&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point I am regretting that I agreed to take a foreign exchange student for five weeks.&nbsp; Not because she is annoying, but because of every other crisis that is zapping me emotionally right now.  &nbsp;  While in Vegas I managed to go off on my own several hours to visit Rick's mother and step-father.&nbsp; Thank God they were home.&nbsp; I knocked on the door and Bob opened it and didn't quite recognize me.&nbsp; I said, ""Bob, it's Lisa.&nbsp; Is Eve here?""&nbsp; So he took me back to the kitchen, and I saw Eve, and started crying, and she saw my face and realized I knew about Rick, so she started crying, and we just hugged and hugged each other.&nbsp; We finally sat down and she began the long horrible story of what happened to Rick.  &nbsp;  As I guessed, Rick's problem began right after Mother's Day, about May 13.&nbsp; (My last email from him was May 10)&nbsp; He was feeling terrible pain in his lower back, so his wife took him to the emergency room.&nbsp; He had a slipped disc, or herniated disc, something like that.&nbsp; They put a pain patch on his lower back and sent him home with his wife, apparently not telling her about the pain patch.&nbsp; Now, this pain patch never should have been used.&nbsp; This was something that was only used on cancer patients and others who had grown immune to every other pain killer.&nbsp; Not only that, but it was the maximum strength.&nbsp; The lowest dose was 25.&nbsp; They gave him 100.  &nbsp;  At home, he slept the next 36 hours, and his wife was only able to wake him for very brief periods.&nbsp; She finally called the paramedics.&nbsp; As they were transferring him from his bed to the stretcher, he went into massive cardiac arrest.&nbsp; It turns out that the pain patch had lowered his blood pressure so drastically that he barely had any circulation.&nbsp; Bear in mind that I am not a physician and I am only relating what I can remember, and I was absolutely horrified as I was hearing this story.  &nbsp;  This is going to be a long post I'm afraid.  &nbsp;  When they got Rick to the hospital, they put him on full life support.&nbsp; To make a long story short, they told his wife and mother that if he survived he would have brain damage and be blind.&nbsp; However, over the next few weeks he regained consciousness.&nbsp; He opened his eyes and asked his mother, ""What happened to me?""&nbsp; It seemed as though he would recover.&nbsp; But then, he began having seizures.&nbsp;&nbsp; His immune system was so zonked that he caught the super-flu.&nbsp; And apparently this is what finally killed him.&nbsp; After six weeks, he passed away on June 29, two days before his 47th birthday.  &nbsp;  I cannot tell you how shocked, sad, and angry I am.&nbsp;&nbsp; I consider this murder on the part of the doctor who put the pain patch on him.&nbsp; Rick's wife will sue for malpractice and I hope she wins.&nbsp; I hope that doctor loses his license.&nbsp; This never should have happened.&nbsp; The ironic thing was, Rick never trusted doctors.&nbsp; He would always tell me, ""Fifty percent of the doctors graduated in the bottom half of their class.""  &nbsp;  And I cannot get Rick out of my head.&nbsp; It has been a week, and the memories do not go away.&nbsp; They just get more vivid.  &nbsp;  Rick's mother and step-father invited me to lunch.&nbsp; They were always so wonderful and kind.&nbsp; Over lunch, I showed her the pictures of Rick and me that I had accumulated over the three years we were (mostly) together.&nbsp; She was so happy to see those pictures.&nbsp; She told me how grateful she was that I came, and that Rick was such an important part of my life.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Thank god I did not throw those photos away.&nbsp; I found out several things.&nbsp; A few of the photos were taken at Julia Pfeffer Burns State Park in Big Sur.&nbsp;&nbsp; Eve said, ""Oh, Rick took us there.&nbsp; He told us that you made him promise never to take another girlfriend there, and he hasn't.""&nbsp; Of course, that made me start crying all over again.&nbsp; Another photo was of a street artist in San Francisco who made paintings using spray paint and can lids.&nbsp; Eve said that Rick had begged her on her last trip to San Francisco to please find that street artist and buy one of those paintings.&nbsp; She looked everywhere and even asked other street artists, but couldn't find him.&nbsp; Eve and I looked at each other, realizing that Rick had intended to send that picture to me.  &nbsp;  I was gratified to know that he still thought of me.&nbsp; I guess I already knew that, because he kept emailing me.  &nbsp;  I told Eve and Bob about how after we broke up, Rick opened a brokerage account in my name using my social security number and forging my signature.&nbsp; He invested some money and built it up to about $3500.&nbsp; Apparently he intended to build it up to quite a bit, and then turn it over to me.&nbsp; But at the end of the year he got the 1099-DIV and realized that I would be in big trouble with the IRS if I didn't declare this on my income tax.&nbsp; So he had to 'fess up and mail everything to me.  &nbsp;  I guess that was the point that I finally stopped ignoring his emails, and we began our correspondence.&nbsp; At one point he asked, ""Will I ever see you again?""&nbsp; I wrote back with one word: ""No.""&nbsp;&nbsp;I was to marry Craig in April, and he went on to marry Carolyn in August. &nbsp;  This is going to sound terrible, but the one thing I can take satisfaction in is that Rick died longing for me.&nbsp; I know he loved his wife, but the absent one is always the one who becomes idealized.&nbsp; In a sense I am doing this with Rick now that he is dead.&nbsp; I have to force myself to remember all the rotten things he did too, like cheating on me with Caroline.&nbsp; And I have to remember that Craig is my true love, the one who cares for me AND my daughters.&nbsp; Damn Craig for being gone all this week at that stupid Juggling Convention.&nbsp; If he were here, I wouldn't spend so much time absorbed with Rick.&nbsp;&nbsp; I need my Craig.  &nbsp;  To further mess with my head, when I returned&nbsp;to the hotel room after&nbsp;visiting Eve and Bob, Shelby announced, ""Wendy has been talking to Rick.""&nbsp; Wendy promptly produced a letter that she had done using her ""guided writing"" (which is where one communicates with, and writes down the words of, a dead person).&nbsp; I sat down and started reading the letter and began to cry all over again.&nbsp; Because it sounded like Rick's words.&nbsp; Either that, or Wendy has an uncanny memory of details that occurred over six years ago.&nbsp; One phrase that stood out was ""my precious Math teacher"".&nbsp; Rick always called me precious.&nbsp; But&nbsp;this was&nbsp;always during private moments.&nbsp; &nbsp;How could Wendy know that?&nbsp; Coincidence?&nbsp; I have never had a boyfriend or husband call me ""precious"" except Rick.&nbsp; It was always ""sweetie"", ""sweetheart"", ""honey"", or ""babe"".&nbsp; Today on the drive home I asked Wendy, as she was waking up from a nap, ""Wendy, do you remember what Rick's pet name for me was?""&nbsp; She said, ""No.""&nbsp; I pressed, ""Do you remember what he used to call me?&nbsp; A nick name?""&nbsp; She said, ""No.""  &nbsp;  So now, I have to consider that Wendy may in fact be psychic, and not schizophrenic.&nbsp; If people believe in God, including me, aren't spirits in the realm of possibility?  &nbsp;  Yesterday I was wandering around the ""Dessert Passage"" shops in Aladdin while the girls were off shopping.&nbsp; Of course, I was lost in thoughts of Rick, when suddenly I realized what song was playing in the b.g.: ""As I lay me down to sleep"" by Sophie B. Hawkins.&nbsp; This was a special song that Rick and I shared.&nbsp; Another coincidence?&nbsp; No, at that point I firmly believed that Rick was sending me a message that he was a spirit now.  &nbsp;  Well, this is enough for today.&nbsp; I'm glad to be home, even though Skittles peed all over the carpet.  "
13069,3851365,"08,July,2004",2004-07-08,"   Was sad all day today. Last night I asked Craig if he would mind if I attended Rick's memorial service today. Craig said that was fine, that he was not the jealous type. But this morning he told me that he thought I shouldn't go, that I should focus on the living (Wendy, Shelby, and the foreign exchange student) and not the dead. And that six years had already gone by, meaning this was in the distant past. (To me, it was like yesterday)   I knew that Craig was right, so I made plans to take the girls shopping down in San Diego. But all day I was filled with an unexpected deep sadness, and memories of things Rick and I had done together. We were only together on and off for three years, and most of it was tumultuous, but we had a deep bond. I don't know why I loved him, I just did. And I really can't believe he is gone. It's like someone made a mistake, whether it was God or karma or whatever.   I tried calling the coroner's office to find out why he died, but the woman who answered the phone didn't understand the lab report, so she told me to call back tomorrow and talk to the doctor.  "
13070,3851365,"07,July,2004",2004-07-07,"   Was reading the paper tonight and came across my ex-boyfriend Rick's photo on the obituary page. My first thought was, ""This is a weird joke someone is playing."" Or, ""maybe they have the wrong guy's name and photo"".   I don't know how this happened. I read the obituary through two or three times. Mentioned his wife and 3-year-old son, but not how he died. My guess is it was either cancer (because his father died from cancer) or a car accident. I'm leaning toward the latter. He had a red ferrari and I know he liked to drive like a race car driver. He got in a serious accident about 10 years ago when he was married to his first wife.   The other weird thing is, I used to get an email from Rick a couple times a month, asking me how I was doing, etc. Sometimes he told me about outings he took his son on. Sometimes he attached photos. I would respond within a week, but he always answered my emails the very next day. The last email came May 10. When I didn't hear from him for a few weeks, I wrote him and asked what was going on, was everything all right. Still no word. Two weeks later I wrote again and told him I was worried, and to please write and let me know everything was okay. No answer. So I assumed that his wife somehow found out he was emailing me, and told him to stop. So I respected this (apparent) decision on his part, and did not contact him again. I felt it was for the best anyway, as Rick needed to stop thinking about me and dedicate himself to his marriage.   You may think I have a big head, thinking that&nbsp;2 or 3&nbsp;emails a month from a guy meant he was obsessing on me. But I know Rick better than anyone, and I know he was obsessive-compulsive, especially about women who walked out of his life. All the time he was with me, he mooned over his first wife. Then, when I broke up with him, he sent me emails telling me that he finally stopped obsessing on Candace, that now he was obsessing on me. (well, too bad he couldn't get it in sync. I figured this was his new girlfriend's problem, not mine.) Rick was a deeply depressed man. I tried to repair him by loving him, by being the perfect girlfriend, but it wasn't enough. He needed another girlfriend for the weekends I couldn't be with him. Endlessly needy.   Yet, he cared about me. It's been almost six years since we broke up, and both of us have remarried, and still he wrote to me religiously. I got used to being ""the woman he obsessed about"". So now he's gone and I feel the absence, even though I haven't seen him in years or heard his voice. There's no Rick out there thinking about me. This is totally self-centered, I know. The real tragedy is the wife and little boy he left behind. The tragedy is that this haunted man never enjoyed the good things right in front of him. A sad life cut very short.   I used to fantasize about running into him some day, one of those bittersweet cinematic moments where the ex-lovers cross each other's paths, and make stiff, polite conversation, all the while fighting the need to hug one another and cry. I guess I'll never have that moment.  "
13071,3851365,"06,July,2004",2004-07-06,"   Today I took our foreign exchange student, plus another foreign exchange student from Austria staying with a different host family, to the Wild Animal Park.  This was the first time the two girls met, and they got along instantly.  What a relief for Esen to finally find someone with whom to converse in German.  I had to take Wendy with us, because Craig had to go to a meeting, and we did not want to leave her alone.  When we got back, Wendy tried doing another spell in the backyard lighting another piece of paper on fire.  The fire immediately got big enough to be worrisome, so she came to me for help putting it out.  She says that she is through lighting papers on fire, and will only light candles.  We stressed that this can only be under our supervision, when one or both of us is at home.  I got upset with Wendy at the Wild Animal Park when she told me that she tried to use her debit card at the gift shop, and it got rejected.  This is the 5th, and she gets her SSI payment on the 1st, which means she managed to spend $550 in less than 5 days.  Wendy couldn't figure out how where the money went, so when we got home I called the credit union and it turns out that she had purchased something on the internet, and the company preauthorized too much money, which was released back to Wendy later today, so she actually has a balance of about $78.  I wanted to take Wendy to an introductory Kabbalah meeting tonight, to try to get her into a more ""mainstream"" spirituality - something that does not involve candles and spells - but she tried on some pants and got extremely upset because she could not fit in them, so I told her to take a walk instead.  I have not heard anything from Dr. Castillo's office about the biopsies.  I don't even know where she took them from, it looked like she was scraping my uterus.  The last thing I need right now is cancer.  "
13072,3851365,"06,July,2004",2004-07-06,"   This is the handwritten letter Wendy brought down to me, after our talk.    Dear Mom   I would like to say, I am really sorry for what happened.   I suffered alot after being depressed.  So I am so happy, I feel I can get away with too much.   I was vain.  I was very impatient.  I wanted my hobbie to work.  I have ""friends"" on the other side.   They tell me I can get friends in the real world - they see me for who I am.   So I talk to them alot.  I asked them to give me power.   I am very upset I hurt you.  I only tried to help myself.    I want other friends.  Very bad.  But you seem to be the only one who cares.   I should not have let this out on you.  I am strong, and will make more friends.  I am shy, thus I need help from the other side.   Only under your supervision will I ever succeed in any thing I do.   Wendy  "
13073,3851365,"06,July,2004",2004-07-06,"   I oscillate between despair, denial, and cautious optimism.  Wendy seems to be in better spirits the last few days, since coming home from her father's.  I really thought we got through to her that she must never lie to us again, and that she must obey the house rules.  But tonight she tried to do another spell in her room involving setting a piece of paper on fire.  Of course, the fire got bigger than the dish containing it, and we ran up there when we smelled the smoke.  Again, Craig and I had to reiterate that she is not allowed to burn things in her room, and that if she wants to burn things outside, one of us has to supervise.  What upsets me most is that she knew she was not supposed to do this, but she did it anyway because she wanted the right to ""get closer to her gods"".  She feels we don't understand her religion, whatever that is  - wiccan I guess.    I told her that if she lies or goes behind our back one more time, I am sending her back to her dad's.  "
13074,3851365,"09,August,2004",2004-08-09,"   Wendy, Shelby and I visited Dad at the hospital tonight.  It took an hour and a half to get to Riverside.  I told him next time to go to the Kaiser in Escondido.  Anyway, he looked fine, but they gave him a lot of tests to figure out why his heart is racing and he's getting shortness of breath.  He may come home tomorrow, but probably Wednesday.  I really hope they can figure out what's wrong with him.  I chatted with Anna Mae again tonight, and I told her how snotty Ellie was on the phone with me last night.  She said Ellie had no business to talk to me that way.  She also said that when she was visiting my dad last night in the emergency room, she announced she was ""furious with Lisa"".  I asked Anna Mae why she could possibly be furious with me?  Anna Mae said that Ellie thought I should have rushed up there the second I heard my dad was admitted to the emergency room.  Of course I would have if Anna Mae had told me to, but Anna Mae told me that he was fine, and not to even call him for a few more hours.  So, once again, Ellie is trying to drive a wedge between me and my dad.  And for what?  I already bought the house, and his investments are dwindling, so what can she hope to get out of him?  I wanted to call Ellie and give her a piece of my mind for badmouthing me in front of my dad, but Anna Mae asked me please not to, because then Ellie and my Dad would know I found out from her.  And that this was not a good time, because of my dad being in the hospital.  So I promised her I wouldn't say anything right now.  Still having problem with the check from ETS that was bounced by Wells Fargo.  ETS's bank Wachovia said they already paid the check, Wells Fargo said they never got the money for the check, and ETS says it's my problem.  This has been going on since late June.  I left a nasty message with ETS when I got home from school today telling them that I am taking them to Small Claims Court if I don't get a new check in two days.  I cannot believe that in this day and age of electronic transactions, that money can simply be lost and unaccounted for.  It's only $107 but I want my freaking money.  Craig retained attorney today.  And so the games begin, anew.  "
13075,3851365,"08,August,2004",2004-08-08,"   The past 10 days has been relatively peaceful and stress-free. Shelby spent the week visiting her aunt, uncle, and cousins in TN. Wendy even spent a few days at Popi's. All I had to do was a few of the usual errands - getting Shelby registered at VCHS, etc. In the evenings we planted some desert plants in the back yard.  Back to school tomorrow for 7 days of teacher inservice (which seems excessive). One day meeting with my new group (the 10th Grade team), two days of new teacher inservice, and four days of school-wide inservice. I hate these things. They take two hours to step you through a manual that you could read on your own. Maybe this is so teachers can experience firsthand what students feel.  My dad's neighbor Anna Mae called tonight to tell me she brought him to the emergency room. He was experiencing severe pain in his chest, and around his back. Plus, his heart has been racing for about a week now. (He saw his doctor on Tuesday, who changed his prescription) So, he has three kidney stones plus they want him to stay in ICU for a few days to monitor his heart. I talked to him briefly and he sounded in good spirits.  Ellie (his ex-girlfriend) just called to tell me to come to his house tomorrow morning to pick up his shaving kit, toothbrush, and mints, to take to him at the hospital in Riverside. (which is an hour drive from here) I told her I had to work tomorrow, but would be happy to bring them up to him when I got off work in the afternoon. In the meantime, he could buy a toothbrush from the hospital pharmacy for $1.99. She immediately guilt-tripped me with ""Well, I'll just bring it up to him tomorrow because he'll need these things. But you'll need to go see him tomorrow night."" (Thanks, you bitch, for telling me what to do.)  I really hate her. And I hope my dad will be okay.  The judge deferred Craig's case with ex-wife til September.  We have decided to retain a lawyer to help him, because even though he does a good job writing down all the facts, it takes a lawyer to know all the procedural crap.  He found a lawyer who said that we are going to deposition the ex so that she can reiterate her lies under oath, on tape.  Cost of Retaining Lawyer: $6,000-$8,000 Cost of Getting Ex-Wife off our Backs: Priceless  "
18117,3851875,"08,July,2004",2004-07-08,"   I feel kind of guilty after my last posting. It's funny, you know, because I didn't write about anything that had not been on my mind for months. But I guess that, somehow, put feelings in writing equals to fully acknowledging them. There's no way to deny that you felt like this or thought about that if you have written about it; contrary to thoughts and ideas, the written word stays there, showing what you are.  I had the impulse of deleting the whole post, the whole blog. I thought that maybe I should write only about everyday things and keep my feelings to myself. But then thought that that was ridiculous. I mean, one can be pretty anonymous around here, if that's what one wants. And the chances of someone from my real world stumbling here and identifying me are nil. And for all I knew, maybe no one would ever read this blog. But I felt guilty about having written about the ex, and about my feelings for my husband, for anyone anywhere to read it. Maybe I felt as if I was betraying him.  I suppose this is the same feeling that has kept me from seeing a shrink. I have always been a very discreet person, who would only confide in a few friends of many many years. The idea of talking about my most inner secrets to someone unknown is still a shock for me. Now that I think about it, I even wonder how did I utlimately make the decision of starting this blog. I guess I was pretty sure that no one would read it!   "
18118,3851875,"07,July,2004",2004-07-07,"   So, an ex-boyfriend called today. Not any ex, mind you, but  The Ex . I suppose I shouldn't make a fuss over it, and in some way, I don't. He just called to say hi (FYI, we broke up back in 1993, and after months of (me) being heartbroken, we managed to remain best friends. Then I got married, he got married and moved out of town, and we sort of lost contact). He's been married for 2 years. I've been married for almost 5. But to be perfectly honest, I asked him if he was very happy, and was kind of hoping that he would give me the great news that they had split or something. No such luck...  By now, one would be wondering what on earth do I think I'm doing. Well, to be honest, I'm not happily married. Not that I'm in a living hell or anything, but I'm just not happy, plain and simple (or rocky and complicated, it depends on your take!) I'm not unhappy enough to end my marriage  (sometimes I believe that later I'll regret my lack of decision, though) , but I'm sure that if I had a chance with someone else, I would give serious thought to that option. What a bitch.  Well, this guy was the love of my life, you see. I never ever loved anyone the way I loved him. On top of that, we had the most amazing chemistry I've ever seen. I'd never felt like that before, and I have not felt like that since.  Just for the record, I did love my husband when we got married. But too much has happened, so for now I only feel affection for him, that's all. No love, no sexual attraction. Actually, when you think about it, it's quite depressing...!  I guess I'll be writing more on this later. Who knows, maybe putting these things on ""paper"" will help me. My oh my, what a first posting!   "

30340,3855724,"08,July,2004",2004-07-08,"    This article really ties into my technology autobiography.  I had to laugh to myself when I read it, as it brings to mind so many conversations that I have had with my parents.  I have two children, one is 3 and the other 5, and they both know how to turn on a computer and find  urlLink Barney.com .  My father has to use both of his hands when operating a mouse, while my 3 year old can control the mouse with one hand and drink juice from a cup in another.  The point that I am trying to make is that children respond to what is around them.  Computers are everywhere, and students are able to do so many things with them. They are able to focus for hours on end on endless possibilities that technology offers them.  One point that I would like to make concerning the article is that this article focuses on upper middle class teens.  I currently work with low socio-economic teens in high school.  So many of my students have not had the exposure that the students at Prospect Sierra Middle School have had. I taught Computer Applications this past school year, and all assignments that I gave students had to been completed in class because so many students did not have computers at home.  This is also a reason that many students use the internet inappropriately.  Students have not had guidance when exploring the internet and when they encounter sites that are inappropriate, curiosity gets the best of them and they often get into situations that they can not handle.  I am convinced that technology is becoming more popular among all people, especially students.  I often remember the card catalogue that I used to find books and articles in a media center. Currently, there is so much more information that can be found from the confines of your own home.  It is necessary for our teens to be well rounded individuals, and technology will enable them to possess knowledge beyond expectations.  Adults must continue to monitor our children, and talk to them so they will understand how important appropriate computer usage is to safety. "
30341,3855724,"08,July,2004",2004-07-08,"    Computers have always been a major part of my life.  When I was in high school in the late 1980's, computers were pretty new.  Although technology was not as advanced as it is currently, I took computer applications in high school, and I was a part of a pilot class where I learned computer programming.  Little did I know then, computers would play a major role in where I would go in my education as well as my career.  I entered college in 1988, and computers were emerging in businesses, schools, colleges, and universities.  There were several computer labs on campus, however, I utilized a word processor to type papers.  Soon typewriters and word processors became a thing of the past.  Anything and everything that you wanted to do was possible by the use of computers.    I escaped the technology surge of the century by graduating from college  before  computers became a requirement for admissions.  When I visit my college campus or friends that live in dormitories, I am amazed to find high speed internet access and desktops in every room.  This is indication that the needs of technology education are a must for everyone if they are to be productive and competitive members of a growing society.  After spending 10 years in corporate America, I decided to switch gears and become a classroom teacher.  I feel that my decision to change careers brought a different focus than that of teachers who had no experience in the business industry.  I understand the importance of technology and I wanted to not only instill an understanding and appreciation in my students, but I wanted to dispel the myths that technology was a threat.  I was able to fully understand why so many of my students were ""afraid"" of computers.  Many of my colleagues don't know anything about computers and they are intimidated by e-mail and any other means of electronic communication.  If an educator is not willing to continue his or her education in technology, how can we collectively encourage our students to embrace technology?  As a high school Fashion Merchandising and Business Law teacher, I am constantly designing lessons that allow students to explore using the internet.  I often find myself giving a lesson in computer applications or internet usage, however, I will do what it takes to make sure students are competent in technology.  If we expect to produce students who will excel in any area, we  must  do what is possible to make sure they are prepared.  Technology education will be a firm foundation for our students' success. "
24656,3857776,"08,July,2004",2004-07-08,"    I am making a little section for animals because well I am a fan of them, and I am hoping to work with them when I'm older, for a job. So every week or two weeks I will be telling you some sort of animal thing that is going on in the world. Example: Every day tons of (water habitated) birds and other animals are dying because of pollution. Most specifically oil pollution. Its like this- a stupid ship or boat will dump their oil into the water, all or most; animals, fish, creatures, etc., will die because of the oil that ship or boat dumped. The birds, will also die, because when they go to get fish out of the water, they cannot tell whether the water looks different or not because first, it is too dark to tell, and second THEY ARE BIRDS, THEY AREN'T THAT SMART. So they will go diving in the water to get fish and they will get stuck in the oil, their wings will get coated in the oil, so they can't fly, so they die. This one section was mostly related to pollution and why we shouldn't pollute the world. And also some oil that is left by ships, is not dumped on purpose, there is sometimes simply a leak. I know that isn't their fault, so if that happens there is nothing I can say. But sometimes ships pollute the water on purpose, even though it is illegal. And they might not even get caught, so you have a ship who is going around polluting the waters, and you don't know who it is. That's when you have a problem. So I made this section to maybe make people to stop polluting the world, or make other people, make the people who are polluting the world, be stopped. So please try to make a difference. Help stop pollution. That's my section for this week and please feel free, once after you have read this, to e-mail me what you think at Nicklachey1lover@yahoo.com  Submitted and made specially by: Ellie "

With my move back so close, I've been going through everything I own in order to scale my vast collection of irrelevant crap down to a reasonably-sized, easy-to-move-around collection of irrelevant crap. I've kept letters, pieces of paper, a marble, a photo of some unidentified person's shoe, someone else's ID, collars of past dearly loved pets and train tickets, all for the sake of memories that mostly&nbsp;I cannot even remember.&nbsp;Going through all of this stuff made me realise how sentimental I am. But the time came, I had to move on, take what I needed, and bin the rest.

21626,3860954,"01,August,2004",2004-08-01,"   -It is no surprise that a generation of children of divorce have grown into a world of extended adolescence, in which so many of them have slept with one another and remained friends, have put the conflicts of sundered relationships aside for the sake of maintaining a coherent life. Divorce has taught us how to sleep with friends, sleep with enemies and then act like it's all perfectly normal in the morning. - I have so much respect for myself but have very little respect for most of the people I sleep with, particularly my subs. Is it that I think I am closer to perfection and less susceptible to temptation than the 'typical chauvinistic males'? I have stronger grudges against women than men, but the biggest grudge I have is against myself.

21627,3860954,"01,August,2004",2004-08-01,"   I've always wondered about certain jobs. Especially those guys who drive the cars in front of trucks with a large yellow sign stating ""Oversize vehicle ahead"", with the flashing lights. It's like ""Hey, what do you do for a living?"" ... ""Oh, I drive one of those cars with flashing lights that say ""oversize vehicle ahead"" ""... I wonder how you'd apply for such a job... License: check, IQ under 90: check.  Everytime I see one, I cannot stop laughing. It's the same with people who lock the cemetary gates at night. ""What do you do for a living?"" ... ""Oh, I lock the cemetary gates at night"" ... ""Oh, so you unlock them in the morning?"" ... ""No, I am not trained in that respect, but sometimes I get extra shifts and lock the public toilets at night... you know, clear out the random gays declaring the site as their new beat, or occasionally a corpse resulting from a drug overdose"". It brought me to a thought... before I actually embarked on my shitty job as a Deli girl, I had never considered those people who served me at the supermarkets, just took them for granted. I suppose quite a few people feel the same way, as I am not treated as a person in my job, only by the occasional thoughtful senior citizen. Today was my last day (or should I say... technically, yesterday was my last day), and as it was a Sunday, my nine hour shift was particularly slow, and I found myself purposefully (and quite obviously) fucking up orders so that my time would be filled with something that to me appeared constructive. Through this job I have become so morbid. Moreso than usual. As I have never liked meat, it was expected that I would be bitter about such employment, but my mind has been playing nastier tricks on me. Occasionally if someone asks for ""silverside"", I swear they are saying ""suicide"". Not long ago I found a bacon rasher that looked like Frankenstein's monster. When opening a new packet of cocktail frankfurts, they are shaped like a noose. Every so often, the weight will come up as 66.6g, or the price as $6.66 (only with particularly evil customers), and it keeps me amused, otherwise I am calmly bitter/cynical/sarcastic toward customers, and find no joy at all in working in an edible mortuary. This all sounds stupid, trust me, I realise. But when stuck in the redneck shithole, little else amuses me. I move back to the city tomorrow, and aim toward finding a new job asap, involving serving alcohol to cockheads and sleazes. Again, I will instantly find issues with that, as well. I should get some intense training as a barista, then I would only have to hear customer complaints second-hand, and not have to bite my tongue to stop myself from articulately telling them to fuck off. Like chicken drumsticks, or cuts of gammon, I find myself comparable to the pristine frozen supermarket meat. But unlike the plastic coated innards, hearts which can be preserved forever, I am just a mass of stinking flesh As life rots me from the inside. Don't worry, I love myself (in a non narcissistic way, I just scribbled down some thoughts on a scrap of Deli paper one afternoon...) Peace, love and baby octopus, Beth xoxox. "

26380,3870574,"08,July,2004",2004-07-08,"   Oscar winning film maker Michael Moore is not patriotic. While talking to Lila Lipscomb in Fahrenheit 9/11, he talks about how great America is. At the end of the movie, he talks about the selflessness of our troops even though early in the movie, Moore makes fun of our young guys playing songs like ""Let the Bodies Hit the Floor"" in their tanks while they put their life on the line.  To further demonstrate his patriotism, he posts this on his website:  ""The Iraqis who have risen up against the occupation are not ""insurgents"" or ""terrorists"" or ""The Enemy."" They are the REVOLUTION, the Minutemen, and their numbers will grow -- and they will win.""  http://www.michaelmoore.com/words/message/index.php?messageDate=2004-04-14  Some support of our country, Mike.  As for United Nations help?  ""There is a lot of talk amongst Bush's opponents that we should turn this war over to the United Nations. Why should the other countries of this world, countries who tried to talk us out of this folly, now have to clean up our mess? I oppose the U.N. or anyone else risking the lives of their citizens to extract us from our debacle. I'm sorry, but the majority of Americans supported this war once it began and, sadly, that majority must now sacrifice their children until enough blood has been let that maybe -- just maybe -- God and the Iraqi people will forgive us in the end. ""  It is a sad day in American politics that when your level of political ""dissent"" reaches as far as predicting and wanting the enemy of our soldiers to win. The worst part? Michael Moore is not off base in the eyes of the Democratic Party and many of their members. Hate our President Mike, but don't hate our troops.  "
26381,3870574,"08,July,2004",2004-07-08,"   I did not what this title be deceptive. The truth is that John Kerry has no vision for America. I challenge anyone reading this post to find his vision. While reading  John Kerry on the Issues  on his personal website, I came across something that is very disturbing.  Let me quote John Kerry's stances on the issues:  John Kerry on the Issues   Economy:  ""John Kerry has the courage to roll back Bushâ€™s tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans so we can invest in education and healthcare.""   College Affordability:  ""While George Bush gives tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans...""  ""John Kerry has the courage to take on Bushâ€™s tax cuts for the wealthy so we can invest in education.""   Education:  ""John Kerry believes that we need to invest in our schools instead of giving tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans.""   Health Care:  ""George Bush has chosen to lavish tax cuts upon the wealthiest...""   Homeland Security:  ""John Kerry has the courage to roll back George Bushâ€™s tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans so we can invest in homeland security.""   National Service:  ""Whether it is protecting America from the threats of terrorism or addressing the problems we have at home, America's new challenges will not be met by the same old answers of big government or big tax cuts for the wealthy.""  Kerry's vision? The only one that I can see is a promise to raise our taxes and take money out of the pockets of the middle class, working Americans.  "
26382,3870574,"02,August,2004",2004-08-02,"   I'll give some of you some of the reasons why I feel that John Forbes Kerry is bad for America based on my research on him.On key votes, John Kerry has sided with Senator Ted Kennedy 94% of the time.      Kerry has voted against a balanced budget amendment at least five times. Fiscally responsible? Kerry voted against President Bush's tax cuts which Alan Greenspan claimed to have pulled the economy out of the recession. ""The first priority is the economy of our nation. And when you have a downturn in the economy, the last thing you do is raise taxes or cut spending. We shouldn't do either We need to maintain a course that hopefully will stimulate the economy...No, we should not raise taxes, but we have to put everything on the table to take a look at why we have this structural problem today... you don't want to raise taxes"" (John Kerry on NBC's ""Meet The Press,"" September 2, 2001)       Then, in April 2002, Kerry said he wanted a larger tax cut and was ""not in favor of"" a repeal. CNN's Tucker Carlson: ""Senator Kerry...[many Democrats] [g]et a lot of political mileage out of criticizing [President Bush's tax cut], but nobody has the courage to say repeal it. Are you for repealing it?"" Kerry: ""It is not a question of courage... And it's not an issues right now. We passed appropriately a tax cut as a stimulus, some $40 billion. Many of us thought it should have even maybe been a little bit larger this last year...[T]he next tax cut doesn't take effect until 2004. If we can grow the economy enough between now and then, if we have sensible policies in place and make good choices, who knows what our choices will be. So it's simply not a ripe issues right now. And I'm not in favor of turning around and repealing it."" (CNN's ""Crossfire,"" April 16, 2002)      Eight months later? NBC's Tim Russert: ""Senator...should we freeze or roll back the Bush tax cut?"" Kerry: ""Well, I wouldn't take away from people who've already been given their tax cut...What I would not do is give any new Bush tax cuts..."" Russert: ""So the tax cut that's scheduled to be implemented in the ocming years...."" Kerry: ""No new tax cut under the Bush plan...It doesn't make economic sense."" Russert: ""Now, this is a change, because let me show you what you said in September 2001 when I asked you the very same question."" (NBC's ""Meet The Press,"" December 1, 2002)      Kerry claims to want to make this a clean campaign, but in a statement he said on June 19th, 2003, he said that President Bush ""misled every one of us."" (Ron Fournier, ""Kerry Says Bush Mislead Americans On War."" The Associated Press, 6/19/03)      Four days days earlier?George Stephanopoulos: ""People are really upset that they feel misled by President Bush on this issue of weapons of mass destruction. I know you said you're agnostic about whether or not he misled the public on weapons of mass destruction. But do you have a hunch on whether you think they hyped the intelligence?""John Kerry: ""George, again, I think it would be irresponsible of me at this point to draw conclusions prior to all the evidence being on the table. What I know is we have to get that evidence. We have to have an investigation to know to a certainty whether or not it was hype, whether we were misled..."" (ABC's ""This Week,"" (6/15/03)        Kerry has voted for at seven major reductions in Defense and Military spending, neccessary for our national security.         In 1996 - Introduced bill to slash Defense Department Funding by $6.5 billion      In 1995 - Voted to feeze defense spending for seven years, slashing over $34 billion from Defense.         Fiscal 1996 Budget Resolution - Defense Freeze. ""Harkin, D-Iowa, amendment to freeze defense spending for the next seven years. In 1993 - Introduced plan to cut numerous defense programs, including:          Cut the number of Navy submarines and their crews.      Reduce the number of light infantry units in the Army down to one.      Reduce tactical fighter wings in the Air Force.      Terminate the Navy's coastal mine-hunting ship program.       Force the retirement of no less than 60,000 members of the Armed Forces in one year         Military hardware he felt we nolong need since the ""cold war"" is past. The money would be better spent on ""social"" programs.

""On what he'll do if he's elected to Congress,"" Kerry said he would 'bring a different kind og message to the president."" He said he would, ""Vote against military appropriations."" (Candidate's For Congress Capture Campus in Andover,"" Lawrence [MA] Eagle-Tribune, 4/21/72)        I leave with this.        ""So you can look at all the potential threats of the world, and when you add the expenditures of all our allies to the United States of America, you have to stop and say to yourself, 'What is it that we are really preparing for in a post-cold-war world?""-Senator John Kerry, Congressional Record, 5/15/96, p. S5061)        That makes me feel warm, how about you?  "
26383,3870574,"01,August,2004",2004-08-01,"   I have talked at lengths about why John Kerry is bad for America. I feel compelled that right now I should lay out a case for why the President is better than John Kerry.      Faith      President Bush is a man of great faith. He was a former alcoholic that seeked God to help reform his life. He pulled himself up by the bootstraps with his faith giving him strength. As a Christian, George W. Bush represents the Judeo-Christian values that the majority of Americans hold, and represents the history of what this country was founded on. All though President Bush is a man of faith, he knows the value of being ""strong in faith and secular in politics"". His faith gives him the strength and moral conviction to do what is right for the country.  With his proposed faith-based initiatives, it gives children to go to community centers where the church is the only place where there is the only safe haven.           Economy:           The economy has been through some tough times.After inheriting an economy that was slumping near the end of the Clinton Adminstration, President Bush was handed the tragedy of the September 11th attacks on our nation, which deeply hurt American businesses and American confidence dramatically. Furthermore, the high-profile corporate scandals of Enron and WorldCom compounded to the problem by weaking confidence in our nations CEO's. Americans were wary of buying stocks of companies in fear that they were ""cooking the books"".           The President sprung to action and cut the nations taxes so that the money would not be with the government; it would be the with the people that know what is best for that money...the American people.       GDP grew by more than 5 percent over the last three quarters, the fastest rate of growth in nearly two decades.       Productivity grew at the fastest 3-year rate in more than 50 years.       In terms of creating jobs, it could not be any stronger. The tax cuts have put more money in the pockets of our small businesses so that they can buy more equipment and hire more workers.       Since last August, over 1.4 million new jobs have been created.       The unemployment rate has fallen from 6.3 to 5.6 percent, below the average of the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s.       This job growth is widespread â€“ employment over the last year was up in 44 of the 50 states, and the unemployment rate was down in 46 of the 50 states.      This job growth is widespread â€“ employment over the last year was up in 44 of the 50 states, and the unemployment rate was down in 46 of the 50 states.      This job growth is widespread â€“ employment over the last year was up in 44 of the 50 states, and the unemployment rate was down in 46 of the 50 states.       Homeland and National Security:      The highest priority of President Bush is to keep Americans safe. He is decisive in his actions. He has the moral clarity to differenciate the difference between good and evil. He has the courage to stand up to dictators, despots, terrorists and tell them that America will respond to attacks on our country and we will take the fight to them. He believes in the philosophy of going after the terrorists before they come here.      He has created many new measures to make it harder for terrorists to attack on the homeland. With the Passage of the USA Patriot Act, inter-agency communication is improved. President Bush has created a number of new agencies that make it faster and easier for our border agents and airport screeners to identify known terrorists.      Furthermore, with the creation of the Homeland Security Department, we now have an agency that is totally focused on preventing and protecting the American homeland from terrorist attacks.       Iraq       President Bush was given a choice. He was to take the word of the CIA to defend America, or take the word of Saddam Hussein. Given that choice, he will defend America every time. With the liberation of Iraq and Afghanistan, 50 million oppressed people now have the taste of freedom.      Even though there is more work to be done in Iraq, we are getting the job done right. President Bush does not believe that running away would be sending the correct message to the terrorists or to the world. America will not waver in the face of terror. We will stand up even when our ""allies"" will not. Eventually, our strength and resolution will bring them to our side.      We should not have to ask the United Nations, France and Germany permission to defend America.       Our servicemen and women represent the best America has. I deeply thank the brave servicemen that risk their lives so that we will be safe and that the Iraqi people will be free.  "
26384,3870574,"01,August,2004",2004-08-01,"   It is obvious that John Kerry is ashamed of being a liberal today. As the the most liberal Senator in the United States Senate, his voting records tells the American people what he does not want them to know. He stands for higher taxes; against the protection of pregnant women. (Laci Peterson Law) He is for sending our troops to Iraq but against giving them the proper equipment to fight the insurgents in Iraq. He is for the Patriot Act, and now he is against it. Why can't John Kerry tell the truth to the American people on the issues he stands for? Is he embarrassed of his voting record or does he not want to give the American people the whole story?       Secondly, when John Kerry spoke the Democratic National Convention, he was trying to display a more centrist, more moderate viewpoint. Clearly from the reactions in the crowd, the Democratic Party is far from being moderate. They cheered the most when John Kerry made his digs at the President and his cabinet. He pledged that ""As president, that is my first pledge to you tonight: as president I will restore trust and credibility to the White House"", only to go on to say, ""I want to address these next words directly to President Bush: In the weeks ahead, let's be optimists, not just opponents. Let's build unity in the American family, not angry division""      Furthermore, Kerry goes on to say:      ""I will be a commander in chief who will never mislead us into war. I will have a vice president who will not conduct secret meetings with polluters to rewrite our environmental laws. I will have a secretary of defense who will listen to the best advice of the military leaders. And I will appoint an attorney general who will uphold the Constitution of the United States.""          No angry division, Mr. Kerry? How can you, in the course of one speech, flip-flop on your statements? Especially in a speech of this magnitude? The President mislead us into war just as much as you did, Mr. Kerry, and unlike the Senator from Massachusetts, President Bush has a clear and concise view of what he plans to do to protect America. Bush states that he was tired playing defense and he wanted to go on the offensive on these terrorists. (Stated before the 9/11 attacks as chronicled by the 9/11 Commission Final Report.) Bush believes that to defend America we must bog the terrorists by making them move constantly so they cannot plot to murder Americans. President Bush believes that we should not have to get United Nations to get consent to protect our country. President Bush, as did John Edwards did at one point, believed that if we had to defend America without the help with some of our allies, that we will do so.      President Bush is proud of his faith, values and conservatism. John Kerry cannot decide if he is proud to be a liberal. He was a hawk at the beginning of the war. Prior to the re-invention convention, he had to adjust to a more anti-war stance to become the Democrats choice to run for President, and now, at the time where he speaks to the country, he comes to the center and tries to have it both ways. Mr. Kerry, it will not work. The American people see a straight shooter in President Bush. They see you as someone who says what is politically expedient. And in November, it will show as President Bush will have ""four more years"". For you Mr. Kerry, no ""help is on the way"".  "
10223,3873570,"10,July,2004",2004-07-10,"   At the age of 23, I was barely making it financially.  Yes I owned a small place, but I earned a low salary that barely helped me get to the end of the month.  Once a month or every 2 months my mom bought me stuff at the groceries.  I was lucky because I used a uniform at work, which the hotel cleaned for me, and they provided one meal a day.  Food was not the best, but there was a slight selection.  I am getting off subject of what I wanted to write.  I lost weight, smoked, and dated a loser.  Finally I was lucky enough (I can say that now) to be dumped before Christmas 1993.  In February I ended up going to Cancun, instead of Rio de Janeiro, and I met Steve.  I did not want to meet any guy, after my recent break-up, but things happen for a reason.  I thought I would never see him again, so I had fun for intense 3 days.  As it turns out we continued talking on the phone, and I received weekly letters.  If e-mail would have been accessible, we would have communicated even more.   After six months, impulsive Clau, decided to sell some things and come to the US.  I thought what if he is the one?  And also I had many things that helped me make up my mind easily.  My mom was getting on my nerves calling me 10 times a day asking me for advice she never followed.  My brother's life style was messed up.  He is gay and was involved in promiscuous, abusive relationships.  I did have lots of friends that were excited about my romance, so they were pushing me to do it.  At one point I remember saying: If everything works out, I quit smoking! I was so excited.  There were 2 reasons to consider staying in Argentina: my grandparents and my recent closeness to my dad. My grandparents had been the support since pretty much I was born, and gave me ethic, moral and love guidance.  My mom never expressed affection to me, but specially my grandpa showed me love every second.  I lived 2 blocks from their place as a kid, and I would rather be with them than with my school friends.  My grandpa has always been my hero.  He arrived to Argentina with nothing, and worked nonstop until he no longer couldn't.  He had these amazing stories that I could hear for hours.  I played cards with my grandparents and had a blast.  If they were one of the reasons to stay, it all changed in the month of July 1994.   On July 1, I went to see my grandparents and had along conversation with my grandpa, in which he apologized for not being able to give me money to bring to the US and help me.  My mom had spent all the money he had sweat for.  I told him I was a woman, and I could provide for myself.  I told him not to worry about me, because I was a fighter and I was independent.  He looked relieved and happy.  That night I went out, it was hot, and I mixed alcoholic beverages.  I was very sick.  The next morning the phone rang to announce that my grandpa had died of a heart attack, ironically when he was showing a picture on the wall of the house were he had been born in Germany.  My mother or brother were gone, so I was the one in charge.  That was not uncommon, since I've always been the mature of the three of us.  My life stopped, it was as if a dagger cut open my heart.  A few days later, after the funeral and all, I talked to my mom.  She was feeling guilty for having spent all his money, and thought that it caused his death.  I felt peace for having had that conversation with him the day prior to his death, but my hero had died.  My grandma got sick, and died on July 31st, just three weeks later.  They've been together 51 years, so it's not surprising.  After my grandparents were gone, my reasons to stay grew even smaller.  I thought that by trying to make it in another country, I would be repeating my grandpa's story.    The one force remaining for me to stay was my recent connection with my dad.  After many trials and failures to have a relationship with him, I called him and we met for coffee.  I don't remember exactly if I called or he did.  I was amazed by what he told me.  As a young girl, I was convinced that he didn't want me in his life and he didn't love me.  My mom always guilt tripped me, and I believed everything she said.  I was not a girl anymore, and my strong instinct told me that he was sincere.  I started a close connection, only to discover how similar we are even though I grew up without him.  The bad qualities and the good ones, jealousy, gredge, stubborness, humor, strength, happiness, tenderness, dorkiness, you name it.  After a long time I understood why I was so different from mom and Rodrigo.  Many years earlier I wrote him a poem wishing for him to love me, and there it was...  He cared!  Still, I decided to come to the US.  I figured if he loved me, he'll continue to do so.  After 10 years he's the main reason for me wanting to go back.  But that comes in the next chapter.  Stay tunned  "
10224,3873570,"08,July,2004",2004-07-08,"   Wow,I thought it would be easier to start by traveling through my life, starting from the beginning.  I was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina almost 35 years ago.  My mom and dad were together up until I was 3 years of age.  I have a younger brother with whom I have periods of silence and resentment, and others not bad.  When my parents divorced, I was told that I was really angry for not seeing my dad for over 6 months. Apparently, after I saw him I came back with strabismus.  Being crosseyed has always bother me a lot, until finally last summer I had surgery, and I am much better now.  My mom re-married Ricardo, a Uruguayan musician and composer.  He was very creative and nice at the beginning.  During the eight years my mom was married to him, she made me feel very guilty about seeing my dad maybe once or twice a year.  Ricardo overtime became violent, and started to physically abuse my mother and I in particular. I don't remember anything happening to Rodrigo.  I remember trying to fall asleep at night and hearing him hitting my mom, and her pleading for help.  I also remember a couple times in the middle of the night, getting us together and telling us we were leaving the house.  He never worked, and my mom didn't either at that time.  They/we were living of my grandpa's tremendous effort.  He arrived to Argentina from Germany with nothing and built his own little empire.  Ricardo went through a face that he was following the macrobiotic diet.  I will never forget as long as I live that one day I asked him for money to buy candy and he slapped my face and threw his wine on top of m,y school uniform.  I had to go to school after lunch and stinking like an alcoholic...  After eight years my mom finally divorced.   I start a new paragraph because my life completely changed between the time I was eleven until pretty much I was 24.  My mom had depression and sometimes spent days vomiting by her bed with a bucket on her side.  Another thing that happened is that she became very promiscuous, and slept with almost a different man every night.  When I was 12 she told me to smoke pot that it was not addicting.  As a way of rebellion I never wanted to try it. As I became older every time I went out and came back, I would see a jacket hanging on the livingroom's chair.  I knew that man was sleeping with my mother.  A couple times I called her ""puta"", she slapped me and told me that it's either men in her room or her vomiting.  Of course I could not say much.  I started to be silent and to absorb all the things that were going on.  God, I was so embarrassed of my mother in public.  She used to dress with mini skirts and spandex tops...  My friends had good families, so I felt alienated and did not talk much.  I wrote some, but there was less writing than thoughts and feelings.  I started college many careers, but no one told me the importance of getting a college degree.  At the age of 24 my mom sold the big apartment and bought 2, one for me and one for her.  She wanted to live alone.  I felt less cared for than before.  I know I was 23, but I was more alone than ever.  My brother had always been my moms reason of being, and ironically he is the one that has made her suffer the most.  Ever since I was born, the role model and person I admire the most has been my grandpa Leo.  I guess, since I was little I was ambitious, hard working and loving like he was.  If it wasn't for the stable home of my grandparents I could have turn to drugs, sex or alcohol.  I look back, and I know that many people have it worse, but I don't understand where I had the strength to endure all of those tough days...  I will continue at another time.  "
10225,3873570,"14,August,2004",2004-08-14,"    Today was another Saturday in my life. I spent quality time with Steve... we went to have lunch to his buddy's place in downtown San Leandro... we later went to Tapioca Express and I bought some milk tea for my buddy and dropped it off at the mall... I saw her for just a bit, but it was nice... At 5 we went to Union City to watch  The notebook. I've been wanting to watch it for six weeks. I don't know why, but I knew that it was my kind of movie. I haven't seen such a great movie in years!!! I am not the kind of person who buys DVDS, but as soon as this one is out, I want to buy it!!!!    After watching the movie, I wished that my love for Steve was as strong as the love Alley and Noah had. I normally tear in almost any movie, but in this one I cried rivers... It's a must see... an old times like love story. When the movie ended, everyone, or at least so it seemed, was crying. It was cathartic and woke up my romantic side. It also deals with Alzheimers, and the choice to die when ur body is giving up. If I were very sick or had a devastating disease I would choose to die. But as long as I am relatively healthy, I will never leave this world... even if at times I wish I would be gone... I cannot be so selfish to leave when some people count on me... at times I think that's not the case... but when I am sharp I realize that they do...the quick fix would be to take your life so you no longer have to feel... I am not such a coward... or I am one because I could not even try to end my life...even at the darkest moments there is a tiny glimmer of hope... life is a miracle every day... each day should be the first day of that miracle... whoever reads this, specially you Teesa, I love you and need you lots... don't you ever leave me alone in this sometimes cruel world...   "
10226,3873570,"11,August,2004",2004-08-11,"    Today was a day that I wished at many times would end. I wish I could just disappear, so I didn't have to feel or think certain things. The only moment that I seemed to be ok was when I saw Teesa. I was on the verge of crying when I arrived to pick her up. The reason was absolutely stupid: just listening to a cd made me feel incredibly sad about being an Argentinean... then I thought about my dad and his disease...what if the only positive figure in my family dies?...why? yes he's abused tobacco forever, but why would it happen? My mind was racing kind of continuing with yesterday's thoughts.        Somehow, little by little Teesa (with her powers) managed to make me      forget for a while and we had a nice time. After I left her at her house, anguish came back. Maybe I'm pmsing badly, and I try to find a logical explanation when there's none. During the evening I texted Teesa and she helped me feel a little better. At around 8 I called her without anything to say. I hate those times, because I feel I am boring her to death and I called just to pass time. I like when we engage in interesting topics and after talking I feel: wow that was nice... When I am so negative I can never have engaging conversations. why? I wanted to talk some more, I was hungry for one of those conversations. Maybe Monday... if nothing happens so that plans are cancelled. I love my buddy, today my mood was such that I couldn't even tell her I loved her without feeling shy and out of place. Well, tomorrow has to be a better day..."
10227,3873570,"09,August,2004",2004-08-09,"    Today was a fine day!  I saw my best friend.  At the beginning we juast stared at each other without much to say.  It was very comforting to see each other, but we were getting acquainted with our new looks.  Hers is more drastic than mine! She is beautiful no matter what.  After wtaching TV, I let her read the poem.  I've never written a poem to a friend before, she is truly special.  I also showed here the pics and gave small green gifts.  It could not be another color, right?  We went to lunch, and I let her drive through Alameda.  She's actually pretty good!  When we arrived home time was running short, so we did our favorite thing to do: lay in the couch next to each other.  I enjoy that because we are close in body and spirit.  It was almost like a mother daughter situation, Teesa fell asleep on my shoulders!  What's amazing is that I know how hard it is for her to sleep, and being with me relaxed her to the point she could do that.  It made me very happy!  I wish we could have some more of those moments before school starts...  Maybe next Monday?  I don't know.  Besides that nice moment something really important happened: we made a pact.  I will not smoke not even 1 drag, and she will not cut herself even one small cut.  Smoking and cutting are two self-destructive habits we have that need to die forever.  It will work!  I hope from the bottom of my heart that she does NOT let me down, because it could be extremely painful to overcome.  She has my trust and I have hers; we are very vulnerable, but at the same time we are two tough women.  I believe in us!  I love us!   "
10228,3873570,"08,August,2004",2004-08-08,"    It was easy to make the decision to move to the U.S. given everything I've been talking about. My relationship with my dad was way too recent to change my mind. Creating a separation from my mom was what I thought I needed. It was like being free at last... My mom called me at my job at least 7 times a day, it was overwhelming. I thought leaving would be getting rid of my past problems. Well, in reality I carried them in my luggage... I was too impulsive to make the decision to leave my beloved Argentina, but in a way I felt I had no other way of putting my life back together; or better yet, starting to live! I desired so much to come here that I said I would quit smoking... I did. Yes, every time I go I start, but I quit again.   When I came to the U.S. I moved in with Steve without knowing him really. I was gutsy, but otherwise I couldn't. He introduced me to all his friends, and I remember people would not touch or kiss... They hugged in such a fake way that I felt so awkward! I missed and still do the physical contact we have in Argentina. Even if you don't know people, when they are introduced to you by a friend you kiss them on the cheek. Steve went back to work kind of quickly. At the beginning I went to do some sightseeing in SF, but after a while I was like afraid or lonely. I used to stay home and watch soap operas, and by the time Steve got home I asked 20 questions before he could answer the first one! I've always been the kind of person that when I have too much time, I think crazy... After spending some money in shopping at The Gap (because in this country they carry my size, at that tiem was between a 10/12,) I started searching for a job. I thought since I spoke some languages and had experience in Tourism and Hotels, I could get that kind of jobs. But very soon that dream fell apart. In Argentina I would have never worked at a coffee shop, especially cleaning and doing dishes. Finally, I decided to search for a job at a coffee shop. I thought it would be easy, but without papers it wasn't. One day Steve got me job through a friend at Sweet Joana's cafe Howard and Spear. Every day I took the bus, and went to my daily humiliation session. The wife of the owner was very mean to me. At first I was troo shy to ask people to repeat what they have ordered when I didn't understand. I got better over time. Her husband and brother in law liked me and were nice, but she was a bitch. I worked there for a while until one day the bitch told me that business was slow, so they could no longer pay me. The husband hooked me up with another brother of his at the Fisherman's wharf. Things there were different. I was given lots of wasing to do of huge, sticky muffin trays. At least I had someone to talk to, a Mexican girl (Yadira). Customers liked me and I was not shy anymore, but I worked like an ass. The owner sometimes cussed at me behind my back in arab, but always smiled and pretended that everything was ok. He called me wet back, and I had no clue what that meant. Everything continued until one day I was told that a new girl will start ,and I will have less hours and will have to work weekends, so I quit impulsively. I told him I had a better job offer. I had nothing, but my ego was still strong.   Weeks after I found a job close to where I lived (a block away). The owner was Egyptian. I had to prepare food, coffee, clean, mop, you name it. Very soon I was in charge of everything and by myself. Omar would only come once a day if that. Customers loved me, and although the job was demanding I was happy. Business was slow at times and friends from the building came to visit, like the lesbian that made moves on me and Guillermina who got offended by my words... Just an Argentinean expression that it is offensive in Mexico. She was nice. One day, I went to work and the store was empty, Omar moved out the night before. To make things short, talking to some cutomers a Korean man offered me a job in a Blue CHip Cookie store he was opening soon. I went to Argentina in the time being, and started working upon return. I had moved out Steve's place, but when I lost my job, he told me to go back. I worked there for a bit, and Steve offered me to get a Civil Wedding to get my papers. I applied for a job at Office Depot and got it. It was ok. After 4 months Steve proposed with a ring, and asked me to get a degree. I started shyly, but college woke up a part of myself that had been quiet. I went to community college, got my AA, and transfered to Cal State Hayward. I wanted to go to UC Berkeley, like Trish, but I needed to stay one year to finish one class. I knew that no matter where I went I would do good if I just set my mind to it. And I did. I graduated Summa Cum Laude. After graduating I got in a program to receive my teacher's credential, and I did. I've been teaching for 3 years, and I don't think I would do anything else, although it could be stressful at times. THe chase of a dream has been tough, and many times I wanted to throw the towel... I did not, and as I look back I feel proud! No one in my immediate family has received a college degree. In a way what I did is so similar to what my grandpa did... He is and always will be my inspiration...   "
10229,3873570,"06,August,2004",2004-08-06,"    I hate when technology overcomes me! It's the fucking third time I'm writing this blog. I need to be tech smart! Well, the blog's topic was the continuation of my last one. I wrote about the positive influences I had that help me endure tough times. This 2 forces were Mirta and Marta. Mirta was my nanny in my early childhood until I was 11. She was my friend Mirta's grandma. She was there for me, and took my side when she thought I was right. My mom never heard her, and punished me for things my brother did. My buddy Mirta told when I saw her recently in Argentina, that I was always grounded... I was grounded for stuff Ro had done, but my mom always preferred him over me. My mother and brother went out to have fun while I stayed home punished with Mirta. I kind of liked the peace at the house, but   as time went by I grew apart from my mother. It's hard to have feelings today, even if my mother is trying to do the right thing, because she did not plant the necessary seeds or water the plant correctly when it was necessary. It is hard to show affection, when we never did...    Marta was another positive force in my adolescence. She was my nanny from 12 on. She has always been like a big sister. She took my side a lot, since mymom went crazy during my teenage years. We fought at times, but minutes later we were having ""Mate"" and laughing. I learned to cook by watching her, although I took a couple classes with famous chefs from 1992 to 1994. Marta was there when I needed guidance, and gave me advice when I was loosing it. She adopted Carlitos when he was 2. I used to take him to places, and when I saw him recently I could not believe how big he's got! He's 16! My mom always thought that Marta was partial to me, so she never listened when there was any issue w/ Rodrigo. At least someone that favored me! My mom slapped me in the face when ""I went out of control."" With time, I started to laugh, no matter how much I was hurting. She stopped.   "
31551,3875285,"21,July,2004",2004-07-21,"    Some things, some people, prove so important to kids, and in the course of their everyday, mundane lives, they never know the impact they've made on the little ones they touch.     &nbsp;   ""Kenny is the sweetest kid!"" I hear it everywhere I go! Especially from his teachers! Kenny is the kid every teacher wishes she could clone.&nbsp; It all began during a parent-teacher coference&nbsp;in first grade when his over-fifty, experienced teacher gushed with tears in her eyes ""I have to tell you, I just love Kenny!"" And it was mutual. Kenny was so in-love with Mrs. Hotten that the love was transferred over to all things educational.&nbsp; Every child should be blessed with a first grade teacher who so loves her job that the children in her class are sad to go to second grade! Working in the high school, I see plenty of students whose first grade teachers failed to realize the importance of experiencing ""Henry and Mudge"" or ""Clifford the Big Red Dog.""&nbsp; Personally, I have two favorites: ""Harold and the Purple Crayon"" and anything with ""Miss Spider"" in it.&nbsp; The illustrations in Miss Spider's books are so wonderfully created that the pages would be perfect for escaping into a fantasy.    Kenny's first love is fairly obvious to anyone who has the opportunity to visit with him for ...a nano-second. It is his guitars that make the boy's heart pound like the drums in a head-hunter movie. I know, I've heard them when I watched him walk into the Guitar Center.&nbsp; He acquired this love of guitar through a music teacher who was donating his time at Kenny's elementary school when he was in the third grade.&nbsp; The minute he picked up the guitar, you could tell it was love at first sight. The polished wood of the guitar seemed to glow under his little hands.&nbsp; We purchased his first electric guitar for his ninth birthday: A BC Rich Warlock!&nbsp; Okay, so it's a little extravagant for a nine-year old. We wanted him to be able to experience his dreams early to see if they would stick.&nbsp;Our neighbor bought him an amp (don't ask me, I don't know what kind.) to go with the guitar. Heaven for a ten year old boy is created with a nine year old girl, an 11 year old girl and&nbsp;two 13 year old boy standing on the sidewalk as Kenny played the Star Spangled Banner, ala Jimmy Hendrix. The girls squealed, which is, I think, today's equivalent of swooning, the boys' heads jerked like the spasms of dying birds, which I take to mean enthusiasm. And Kenny? Kenny flipped guitar picks like Rick Nelson from Cheap Trick. It was genius, pure genius! Thank you Jeff Bretz for offering the time . You'll never know what you did for him.   Lord, please bless all those teachers who heard your call, who make everyday an adventure for our children. Lord, to those who are discouraged, send a little blonde haired child who melts their hearts. To those who are tired, send a little red-haired&nbsp;child to make them laugh. To those who are hurting, send a little dark-haired child to encourage their hearts.&nbsp; To those who have joy, please Lord, send my children. I thank you, In Jesus' name, Amen. GracieFairy's Mommy   &nbsp;   "
31552,3875285,"08,July,2004",2004-07-08,"    Bobby wanted a baby. Not a girl baby or a boy baby. Just a baby. At the age of three, after asking why Nicholas, his cousin could have a baby and he couldn't, I decided to leave it in God's hands and teach him a lesson about praying in the meantime. I simply told him, ""You'll have to ask God, He sends the babies."" He asked. In a crowded grocery store, when a lady with a cute baby walked by, he would lift his head toward heaven and yell, ""God! I want a baby!"" At the pool, when the mommies walked by with strollers, he'd yell ""God! I want a baby!"" In Toys R Us, walking past the baby toys, he'd yell ""Hey God! WHERE'S MY BABY?"" Evening prayers began and ended with ""God, I reaaallly want a baby!""  For two years, selfish mother that I am, I went along with it. I only needed one carseat to handle. No more diapers, yet, if ever. I was so smug! God does NOT like smugness! Nope, nosireee Bob. God heard Bobby!Two weeks after the rabbit committed suicide, I decided to surprise him. ""Bobby, remember when you asked God for a baby the other night?"" ""Yes."" ""Well, God's sending you a baby."" I expected the equivalent of fireworks bursting in the air in our apartment. Instead, I got ""okay."" For days I would see him talking at the mailboxes to the mailman. His little face would fall, and he'd drag his feet back into the apartment. I asked him, ""Bobby, what's wrong? Was the mailman mean to you?"" ""No, I'm mad because I'm not getting a baby. I tried to tell him I was, but he keeps telling me that he's not gonna' bring my baby to me not matter what God says!So I guess I'm not getting it!"" Isn't that what we do to God? We ask and ask and ask for the same things, and we listen to other people asking for things knowing full well, in our infinite wisdom that God wouldn't possibly answer that prayer! And when it finally is about to be delivered, we fall back into disbelief, or we let ourselves listen to that voice of doubt in our friends or our families, or even ourselves. God is waiting for our faith to move the mountains before us, not our need. Despite the outward appearance, or modern wisdom, He is waiting for us to acknowlege that He alone, is the Most High God who answers our call! Isn't He wonderful!   "
31553,3875285,"08,July,2004",2004-07-08,"    No amount of preparation could have prepared me for Bobby's first day of school.  Books have been written about how watching a kindergartener go off to school with a brand new lunchbox, newly purchased tennis shoes and fresh scrubbed face created bathtubs of tears. Did I glance wistfully as he walked away, or walk into walls as a looked for a last glimpse of my precious baby? HEAVENS NO! I jumped into the car to race home to do what I thought every sane mother of a five year old boy would do...rip off my clothes, run to the tub and turn on the faucet without someone with little grubby fingers beating me to the faucet. My first quiet bath in a hundred years, or so it seemed! After the long soak, I realized, MY Goodness! The phone! I could actually talk on the phone without listening to the Ninja turtles battle, or holding the phone under my chin while I wiped peanut butter and jelly off the keyboard! Everyone I knew who didn't still have kids at home was at work! I still had hours! I needed a plan! Sitting down with a pencil and pen, I devised a schedule: I could get all the housework done in two hours, and still have two hours to pursue other things!Adult things! When my little hero came home, he'd be excited, I'd be excited, it would be wonderful.Two weeks later, he came home with head lice. Three weeks later, his red bumps were chicken pox. Six weeks into school, I struggled to get his lunchbox, homework, and clothes together in time for him to be ON TIME for school! Standing before the mirror, I noticed my blotchy eyes, queasy stomach, dull hair, sore boobs and made a mental note to do ""something"" about myself. And ""where,' I wondered 'had all my free time gone?"" I'd look into it as soon as I took a short nap. Two days later, as my insides exited through my mouth for the third time in the last three days, I knew it! Fate, that master of irony had done it again. My free time would be replaced with doctor's visits and weigh-ins and sonograms and stretch pants. That rabbit hadn't just died, he committed suicide!   "
31554,3875285,"08,July,2004",2004-07-08,"    Why is it that we always seem to hurt the ones we love the most? And we start it at such a young age! Gracie, Katie, Joey and Kenny were outside playing with a little girl down the street. The little girl asked GracieFairy ""who do you like more, Katie or me?"" Of course, Gracie said, ""Karen.""  ""Who do you like more, Moses (Karen's brother) or Joey?""  ""Moses.""  Who do you like more, Bobby or Daniel (Karen's other demon brother.)""  ""Daniel.""  To Gracie, she was telling the truth. Daniel, Karen and Moses don't care if she goes in the street, or walks around with her pull-up looking like a thong under her tee shirt. They don't have to share their prized possessions, and they don't tattle when Gracie erupts with a bad word here or there.  To Katie, who is 12 going on 23, Gracie was choosing children over her family. And it hurt.  It made me think about God, and how he must feel when we get involved in things we shouldn't...like hurtful gossip, or fighting to get to the top at work even if it hurts others. He asks us, ""Who do you like more? Me, or the world? When I discipline you, do you grumble and snivel, and turn to the things of the world to lick your wounds.  Would that we could all choose the things, the people who love us the most, but it's nice to know that when we miss the mark, He's still there, like Katie, to give us His grace, or a cookie, when we ask.   "
31555,3875285,"08,July,2004",2004-07-08,"    Being the mother of children of such a wide age range is amazing! The Prince took a picture of Bobby when he was 5 or 6 sitting on the toilet. It's a nice picture, side view, and all you can see is the toilet and the pants around his ankles. He has always had this thing about the toilet. When it's his turn to take out the trash...in the bathroom; clean out the car...in the bathroom; wash dishes...in the bathroom.  It really frustrates his two younger brothers. Joey, aged 6, is also a throne sitter. We are currently remodeling our house. Wallpaper border just seems to stick better with spray adhesive. I don't know how it happened, I am not pointing any fingers, but recently I came home to find disgusting hair around the toilet seat in the hall bathroom.  When I went to clean it, it wouldn't come off. Apparently, Bobby's aggressive demand that Joey let him in the bathroom resulted in Joey spraying the adhesive on the toilet seat. Yep. A half an hour later, according to Katie the Chronicler (tattletale to most of us,) a roar erupted from the bathroom.  Bobby was stuck to the toilet seat. So, do I laugh 'til I pee or do I rid myself of any responsibility?   "
31556,3875285,"29,July,2004",2004-07-29,"   I am leaving today&nbsp;for&nbsp;two weeks.&nbsp;One of my sisters has been ill and one of my sisters is getting married, so, I am going to Oklahoma and Kansas for two weeks with my eldest sister. &nbsp;While I am excited about being with the sissies, I am so anxious about leaving the Prince and the Princelets. It isn't as if I won't be in contact with them, I have my cellular leash, my lap-top, and all the sissies have desktops and phones, too. I just won't get to see her and she changes so quickly these days. I can't imagine fourteen days without her sucking my eyeballs out (it's really a covert way to get extra kisses from her.) I don't want to think about who will paint the nails on her little ""stinkies"" (Probably, Katie, she's such a good mommie junior!) My heart hears her crying in the middle of the night when she can't find mommy's love handles. I worry that the Prince and the Princelets won't understand what is going on when she is cranky.   Her vocabulary is growing exponentially every day. Her expressions are so darling, I cringe thinking I won't be here to hear them. Yesterday, from the backseat, I heard her tell her brother and sister, ""You two need to stop talking, I'm talking to Mommy! I talking to you, Mommy!""&nbsp;   Most of all, I am worried that she is so young, her feelings will be hurt because Mommy is leaving her behind. I cannot fathom&nbsp;how a 2 3/4 years old child interprets that.&nbsp; While I'm excited, I'm anxious.      Lord, you said ""Be&nbsp;careful for nothing, but in everything, by prayer and supplication, make your requests known unto God."" I know&nbsp;Lord that you are not saying, to be imprudent, but rather, you are saying, don't be full of care, worry or anxiety&nbsp;over anything. So, my supplication is that you would bless and protect the Prince. Give&nbsp;him wisdom to be blessed, to be diligent, to&nbsp;fervently seek you while I am&nbsp;gone. Please bless Robert that he will be the support his father needs. Please let little discordant notes not escalate between the children. Please fill our home with&nbsp;favor and peace. Please help Princess Katie bless&nbsp;her sister, brothers and daddy. Please help her to make good choices while I am gone. Lord, Please comfort Kenny. Lord, he tries too hard to be the perfect child. Please give us patience when he needs to walk his own path, and let us have wisdom to recognize when it is rebellion, and quench it fast. Lord, please walk with Joey. Please let him know the gentleness of your love, and the strength that comes from choosing obedience. &nbsp;Please protect and provide for GracieFairy. Be especially attentive to her heart, Father, so she will know her mommy loves her. Please watch over all the children and the Prince and keep them safe until I come home. I thank you and praise you for your mercy and grace. In Jesus' Name, I pray,       Amen.      Gracie, please know that Mommy loves you, and I will be home before you know it.     &nbsp;&nbsp;  "
31557,3875285,"22,July,2004",2004-07-22,"   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Princess Katie loved water when she was little. Front yard water? Loved it! Pool water? Loved it! Mud puddle water? Loved it! Bathtub water? Loved it! I even caught her dipping a glass into the toilet, taking the glass to Bobby, who thought it came from the cooler, and I barely stopped him from drinking it! Little Katie sunshine still loves water! At 12 years old, she will still take her fashion dolls into the shower and sit in the bottom of it playing until the waterheater runs out. ""It's like playing in the rain, mom!"" She loves to try to take Gracie into the shower or the tub with her and Gracie hates it!  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why is it that the same child who sambas in the rain, skips through puddles, shimmies through the sprinklers and can swim the Englis Channel suddently becomes ""'llergic"" to water the minute the faucet is turned on in the tub?&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the time Bobby and Katie were little, we had problems with bathtime. Bobby, the Ninja Turtle lover hated bathtime. No amount of coaxing, no pretty little soap crayons, no growing sponges would make it easier for him. He hated it and that was it! Katie was so different! Katie loved it all---the pretty soaps, the loofah, the sponges, the moisturizers in mommy's bathroom. She had to try it all. When she was small, I usually let her take one bath by herself in the morning---yes, I watched her, it was just really a morning ritual play time. Then, at the end of the day, she took a bath that included the soap, shampoo and baby lotion and powder. Just like mommy. That lasted quite a while, until the Prince got the water bill. He told me that Katie had to be dirty at least part of the day, or she had to bathe at the neighbor's house. Or I had to bathe at the neighbor's house.Today, she still likes to take two baths a day.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It isn't that Gracie likes being dirty. It isn't even that she hates baths.&nbsp; Still, being the youngest child of five, she takes the brunt of their teasing.&nbsp; In the pool, in the front yard, Gracie can be sitting there minding her own business, and Joey will come flying in like a buzzard and splash water all in her face!&nbsp; If she takes a bath with Joey and Kenny, inevitably,&nbsp;in her&nbsp;babyfairy mind, they're trying to kill her!&nbsp;They get her hair wet, and put that&nbsp;burning stuff on it trying to&nbsp;take out her eyes! If she is&nbsp;""helping"" mommy water the front yard plants, someone runs to tell on her and she gets in trouble...To her, there just&nbsp;is nothing good about water!  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gracie is smart. She knows Joey is allergic to smoke and can't be anywhere around it. Bobby is allergic to work and cinnamon and can't be anywhere around either of them. Katie thinks she is allergic to school, and does her best to avoid all parts of it. With the smoke from the firestorm in the mountains around us, she has a good idea of what it means to stay away from whatever you are allergic to.&nbsp; For a while, Kenny insisted he was 'llergic to kisses. It stemmed from his giggle. Every time I kissed him, I had to ""get the sugar"" from his neck because he laughed so infectiously. He was 'llergic to kisses to be tickled more.&nbsp; Last night,&nbsp;Gracie announced she&nbsp;was&nbsp;not taking a bath with Joey, because she was&nbsp;""llergic."" Something in my memory clicked...She's too young to understand that Bobby was 'llergic to bathwater... I wonder if it is genetic.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gracie has decided she's 'llergic to: taking showers with Katie; sharing my bed with Joey; and&nbsp;letting&nbsp;Bobby tell her what to do.&nbsp; Thank Goodness, she's not 'llergic to kisses.&nbsp;  "
31558,3875285,"21,July,2004",2004-07-21,"   Sometimes, I wonder what it is that I love so much about Gracie's feet! We already know she loves shoe'ies, a trait I passed on to both my precious girlies. Still, even when she runs around outside in her sling-back sneakers (yes, they make sling-backed sneakers for little fairies), and decides to unleash the smell of a toxic waste dump as she takes them off and insists I kiss her ""stinkies,"" I love them.&nbsp; With dirt around and under every little toenail, from playing outside all day, I will still lift them to my lips for a nibble or a kiss just to hear her erupt in infectious giggles.   At night, when she is bathed, powdered and has that sleepy, warm, snuggly milky scent to her, the toes are right there, perfect pink pearls peeking out from her pajamas. You would never know that as Graciefairy drifts off to sleep, the feet become demented, raging monsters that must subdue everything in their path.  To understand the mystery behind this, you must realize that Graciefairy has a beautiful toddler bed of her own. She has Humpty Dumpty sheets (since he's one of mommy's heroes,) a Barbie (yes, Nanny, Barbie-not beheaded Barbie, either) comforter and pillow, and a Scoob and Shag throw blanket on her perfect bed. This bed is two feet from my bed. We can reach out and touch hands.&nbsp; Every night, she is placed in her little perfect bed with her little perfect pillow and her little perfect toes, and a bottle.&nbsp; Somewhere between ""Oh God, this is a great dream: an Estate Sale full of quilts, bakelite, embroidered hankies, rag dolls and books and everyone else is lost;"" and ""No, Mel, I cannot go to dinner with you, I'm married to the Prince,"" I feel the beating begin. The beating is not the beating of my heart. It is the beating of me to death by those little perfectly pink pearlized toes that have become monsters. Gracie has entered the bed, right between the Prince and I. She is laying or lying, which ever you prefer, diagonally across the bed between us.&nbsp; For the sake of the Prince, I always try to keep the feet on my side of the bed. It's a humanitarian gesture.&nbsp; She begins her assault by using the love handles-on my legs (known as saddle bags, garment bags, steamer trunks, to me) to boost herself up in the bed. Then, she begins boosting herself further with all the rolls I have conveniently grown over the years for her rock-climbing/bed climbing assistance.&nbsp; The end of her ascent occurs when her head reaches the headboard, or the Prince is innocently injured in the journey.&nbsp; This child has the agility of a prima ballerina and the finesse of Wayne Gretzky before he earns the penalty box.     The Bible says ""How beautiful are the feet of those who bring the gospel of good news."" It also says in Psalms 91 that ""He will give his angels charge over you to guard you in all your ways, lest you dash your foot against a stone.""   Lord, I thank you for watching over Gracie's feet. Thank you for keeping her safe in all her ways. Thank you for letting her take the Gospel of Peace everywhere she goes. And thank you most of all Lord, that her feet don't smell like those of Grandpa and the Prince.  "
31559,3875285,"20,July,2004",2004-07-20,"   I really don't want to be an alarmist, but Graciefairy seems to have questionable taste in men and I'm a little concerned for her.&nbsp; I can appreciate all the unique effort that went in to making Mike Meyers' movie ""Shrek."" I can see the potential draw to little girls who like to pretend they are princesses in distress, being held captive by a fire-breathing dragon. I even understand the likeness of some fire-breathing dragons to daddies. So, I wasn't even a little concerned when Shrek came out in a double pack with a 3-D version to entice my little fairy. I figured it was good for her to exercise her imagination...It would give me a break from having to watch that evil, dreaded, dvd (demonic video device): SPIDERMAN. Just in case you were wondering, I have nothing against Peter Parker, Spidey, or even the Green Goblin. I have a problem with watching it at least twice a day for three weeks. So, I thought the story with the green ogre would be entertaining, a welcome break from the web-slinger. The second time we watched the movie, GracieFairy looked sweetly up at me and said, ""Mommy, Shrek is my boyfriend!""&nbsp;    Boyfriend!? She isn't even 3 years old! What does she know of a boyfriend? How in the world did she watch this movie and come to this decision? ""Hmm, green skin? Okay.""    ""Tube horns on the head? That's different, okay.""    ""Anti-social? Okay.""    I know sometimes her daddy isn't quite the gentleman he should be, but it appears as if, at the age of 2 and 3/4 years old, that she is either on a mission to reclaim someone, or she's got a thing for bad (and smelly) boys.    Even more than her choice of boyfriend, I mean this isn't an inter-racial problem, it's an inter-species problem, I am worried that her little sensibilities should not know&nbsp;what a boyfriend is before the age of 3 years. Still, on the Cartoon Network, on The Disney Channel,&nbsp;and in the movies they watch, boyfriends are desirable. It's too soon.     &nbsp;    Lord, Please keep GracieFairy a baby as long as possible. Please&nbsp;give me the tools to&nbsp;slow her down when she's moving too fast, and the tools to release her when it's time. Lord, order her steps and please give your angels charge over her in all her ways, according to Psalms 91, lest she dashes her foot against a stone. I thank you and praise you for watching over&nbsp;us.      In Jesus' Name I pray,      Amen.    &nbsp;   GracieFairy, please slow down. Be a baby as long as you can. And when it's time for you to fly, let Jesus fly with you and pick out your friends and paths.    I love you,    Mommy &nbsp;  "
31560,3875285,"08,July,2004",2004-07-08,"   Gracie is one of those children that change the way people around her live their lives. I originally saw her in a dream when I was pregnant with Bobby, eighteen years ago. A little brown haired girl was running to the Prince looking like an italian princess, giggling and crying out, ""Papa! Papa!"" I was sure Bobby, and each of the next three pregnancies was that little italian girl. Nope, not a dark-haired one of the four. They all looked like me.  When Gracie arrived, the day before Thanksgiving 2001, she was special. My heart had stopped during the delivery and many complications created havoc in my body. For her first 11 days, I was in the hospital without her all but two days.  She seemed to know that Mommy needed her. I lived, and began to get better, because I knew God sent her to me. On her first birthday, a week before Thanksgiving, I was at my father's bedside in Oklahoma, as he lay dying. It was the feel of Gracie's chubby hands wiping away my tears when I got home that pulled me through the grief. As she handed me a ""nose monster"" to make me stop crying, I had to laugh and be thankful for the gifts of life God had given me. It isn't just me that Gracie has touched. She wears her love for us like a cloak and we are all smitten.  She but wimpers in the night and her brothers and sisters are at her side. Her oldest brother Bobby is her loyal slave, a post for which he gladly volunteered.  Katie, the woman-child, tenderly brushes the hair of the sister for which she waited 11 years. Kenny, the musician, turns over his most prized possession, his electric guitar, at Gracie's request. Joey, whose six-year old hands can make china shop bulls proud, gently lays on the pillow with her to watch ""Scoob and Shag"" for the three-hundredth time. And the Prince. To the Prince, she is the embodiement of all things soft and wonderful. When she runs to his car yelling ""Daddy, you're home!"" He melts as if he's been gone six months instead of twenty minutes. To Grandma Josephine, she is a ""mini-me."" It is as if someone put my mother-in-love in the dryer everytime Gracie runs!  Yes, this child is  part fairy dust and part nose monster, and I am so thankful she's mine.  "
3175,3877108,"13,July,2004",2004-07-13,"    It's so unbearably hot and humid here outside.  I hate Mississippi summers.  Bear in mind that I mentioned our nursing class of 60 meets in an old dormitory building with air conditioning that works sporadically, if at all.  Makes for a miserably long day.    I think I have very poor size perception.  I don't know that I view myself as big as I am, or view others as small as they are, or something to that affect.  Did that make any sense?  All these skinny minnies in class are doing nothing but increasing my self-loathing.  Yes, these are my own issues.  Yes, it's not their fault.  I'll just blame society.  At least I'm putting these nursing school lessons to good use...  using my defense mechanisms already.  Ha!  There's a girl in our class who was nearly Miss Mississippi one year.  Now all she can talk about is her engagement and upcoming marriage.  She's way too bubbly for 8am.    Another girl in class is recovering from major abdominal surgery and sits in those blasted chairs all day.  Bless her bones!  Our instructors were fully espousing the ""C=RN"" mantra today.  ""C is average.""  ""C gets a bad rap.""  ""You can be average and also be competent.""  I'm not sure I buy into this philosophy just yet, but my standards may have to withhold some lowering as we progress into more difficult classes/projects.  Here's a neat link we read at article from in class today: http://survivenursingschool-snurse-l.org Hope it's still active, check it out.  We didn't actually get to bed bathe each other today.  Instead, we viewed a demonstration of one of our instructors bathing another one.  They also changed the sheets while she was in bed (occupied), brushed her teeth, and gave her a back massage.  The recipient is well liked by most of us so far.  She's a clever, witty little Jewish lady who uses words like ""kibbitzing.""  (did I spell that correctly?)  That particular prof's lecture today was on stress:  symptoms, illnesses, management, coping techniques, defense mechanisms, anxiety, psychotic tendencies.  When it came to the subject of worry, she included a very short but fascinating blurb on shiva.  If any folks out there care to enlighten me on this subject, I'd be delighted.    Besides the lovely bed bath/etc demo, we viewed some of those PBS-type instructional videos that must have been made in the dark ages.  Very informative though - more of bed baths, changing sheets (more complicated than it sounds!), oral care (both teeth and dentures), back rubs, hair care, and that sort of thing.  One thing I was confused about and never got an answer to.  How do you do an occupied linen change when a client/patient cannot be rolled on their side?  A classmate broached the question to our prof and she said, ""Just extra help.  It has to be done.""  Not the most effective of an answer...  This same classmate has already begun questioning authority.  He seems to have a tone of superiority in his voice and constantly wonders of the instructors, ""wouldn't it be better this way?""  These ladies have more nursing experience combined than he is aged in years, but perhaps he hasn't heard the often rumored cardinal rule of nursing school is to shut up and take what you're given. Grin and bear it, anyone?  In addition, several classmates have mentioned being tired of this hygiene/universal precautions silliness and being ready to move on to loftier topics such as pharmacology (we don't have that until fall).  I actually wonder what expectations some of these people had of the field of nursing before they began class with us last week...  I'm wondering if/when we're going to have a section on body mechanics and how we protect ourselves from those injuries nurses seem so prone to.  Maybe when we get around to the mobility/positioning lectures and labs we'll cover that subject.  I've got to get a lab coat.  Today we received a little bit of information on our upcoming teaching/learning project.  We have to prepare a presentation for a group of 3-12 year olds on a subject like stranger awareness, oral hygiene, healthy snacks, etc.  So tonight our group of 4 decided we'd brainstorm on topics and reconvene to make a decision tomorrow.  We'll be speaking to those kids at a church daycare, so no taboo subjects allowed.  What would you want to speak to a 3 year old about that might be offensive anyway?  We'll also end up presenting our information to our classmates as well.    So far the instructors seem to have assumed we automatically know how to do things like put up bed rails, etc.  I'm looking forward to getting some hands on experience during skills lab the next few days.  I'm ashamedly mechanically incompetent.  :)  Of course, nursing school seems focused on very independent learning, as well it probably should be.  We're expected to seek out a great deal of information on our own.  I think many of the community/junior colleges are doing their students an incredible disservice by some of the ""hand holding"" that I've seen exhibited in their courses.    Shaving a man, not sure where we'll get to try that.  Wonder if my hubby would let me use him for practice?    We signed up and paid our SNA dues today.  Got our equipment orders - pen lights, clipboards, scissors, hemostats, steths, BP cuffs everywhere.  We won't know our ""big nurse-little nurse"" assignments until they host a picnic right after fall term begins.  My kids seem to be adapting fairly well to Mom being gone just a little more than usual and having a different pick-up/drop-off person.  My parents spoil them, but not to excess.  I wonder how long a two-year-old can survive a diet of only pancakes?    Tomorrow?  Values clarification and Vital Signs (lecture and lab).  First BIG exam is Friday, fortunate enough to make a 100 on my hygiene quiz today.  Woohoo!  Wish me luck!   "
3176,3877108,"12,July,2004",2004-07-12,"    Door prize to the first person who can identify what song my title quotes from today.  :)  All morning - group theory.  Types of groups, communication in groups, benefits of groups, group stages, group roles, group process.  I'm already beginning to see what someone meant (on a discussion board I frequent) when they talked about their frustration at the amount of psychology, etc (less ""hard science,"" for lack of a better term) in nursing courses.  I'm sure that subject matter I find more appealing will come along, we're just laying the foundation for now.  We also have a big section on teaching/learning this morning.  In our cohort/small groups, we'll be doing a presentation on something such as stranger danger, oral hygiene, handwashing, etc to a group of preschoolers, then a more formal presentation to our class.  Not sure what age group or specific topic we'll have yet, but should find out in the next few days.  Our cohort group hasn't really clicked yet and we all seem to be pretty quiet/shy/nervous about this whole thing.  The meetings of these small groups are out of classtime, so we have to organize those ourselves.  Again my commute/family obligations present play a part in the group dynamic among a class of 19-20 year-olds.    News broadcast today:  we don't do injections until fall, but thank goodness we don't get to practice on each other.  Big fun on the board for tomorrow in hygiene lab:  giving each other baths, brushing each others teeth.  Luckily we can just wear shorts and a tank top and we'll just be bathing extremities.  We have to bring a basin, soap, washcloths, toothbrush, toothpaste, etc to class tomorrow.  Also the big hygiene quiz.  Hygiene lecture was today, covering baths in all their varieties, perineal care, shaving, oral care (dentures, brushing teeth), eye care (contacts, prosthetics), hot and cold applications, back rubs, TED hose, and I'm sure a number of other things I'm forgetting.  We had a special guest speaker today - a massage therapist from a local day spa.  All I can say is, now I really want to go have a massage done.  Sounds like a really interesting job as well as training, something I could see myself doing if this nursing school thing hadn't panned out.    Felt even further isolated today.  I always try to reach out to those who are different, been doing that since high school.  I hate to see someone else snubbed or ridiculed, myself included.  Today at lunch was a stinger.  Another quiet, less ""trendy"" girl and I sat together at lunch.  In the cafeteria, a couple of classmates came over and asked the table next to us if they'd like to come sit with the rest of the nursing students.  Not one word was mentioned to either myself or the girl sitting with me.  I'm hoping she didn't intentionally leave us out, but it's obvious that we're all in the same class...   Bummer.  On tomorrow's docket, in addition to the hygiene lab/quiz and nursing paper due, we'll have a stress and professionalism lecture.  At lunch, the Student Nurse Association reps will come to deliver our supplies (steths, cuffs, penlights, scissors, etc) and take our applications.  We'll also receive some info about the ""Big Nurse-Little Nurse"" program where the senior nursing students mentor us lowly juniors.  Ought to be interesting to hear more about that...  I guess I'm going to have to break down and see my plasma or something in order to buy MS Office Suite LOL.  I can't seem to get anything done without it - downloading PowerPoints, marking up docs in Office....  just what I need, more expenses in an already strapped budget.  Prayer request>That I'll be more disciplined with my own spending/bill-keeping practices and that somehow my money can keep up with my months...   Eek!  :)  I have so much more respect for nurses out there in practice now, after only 4 days of school.  The amount of material to learn is staggering.  Who'd have known there was 42 steps in making an occupied bed?  Or that giving someone a bath could be so complicated?  Or that inumerable number of types a day you'd have to wash your hands.  I don't see how floor nurses manage to give tihs kind of care and get anything done with the patient loads that I hear rumored...   So, at the end of this blue Monday, as I sit down to cram in my APA before my 8:30 am paper tomorrow, my hats off to all you nurses - whether LPN, ADN/BSN/diploma RN, MSN, or any of the other number of titles/degrees you hold.  You guys definately don't get the credit you deserve.  :)   "
3177,3877108,"11,July,2004",2004-07-11,"    Nothing exciting.  Spent the whole time at the in-laws.  Nieces were there, so my boys played with them both indoors and out.  Spent lots of time in the (above ground) pool.  Did manage to get to the university library and couldn't locate any of the books I wanted - found a few that might do the trick for my paper.    Finally got home Sunday evening around 5:00.  Stopped by Grandma's house and she fed us dinner and watched the boys while I worked on my paper a little while.  Have I mentioned yet how blessed I am to have such a supportive family?  I appreciate them so much.    Been sleeping late all weekend, so Monday morning at 5am is going to come way too early for my tastes...   "
3178,3877108,"09,July,2004",2004-07-09,"    The title says it all.  Last night was rough.  Boys up late, didn't want to sleep.  I have GOT to get them on a regular bedtime routine.  Didn't get much studying done.    Universal precautions quiz wasn't so bad.  I missed a question that I should have known the answer to (about the prodromal stage of infection) - ended up with a 95.  Lots of classmates seemed to feel that they over-studied.  That's something I like so far about our grading/school setting.  They post exam grades in our computer system (accessible from the web) on the same day they're taken.  Papers, on the other hand, are a different beast...    Our universal precautions lab turned out to be nothing more than a sterile technique demonstration on the part of our instructor, and the viewing of a CDC-produced video.  Actually got to leave a little early for a change, around 3:30!   We have a nursing history paper due no later than 8:30 on Tuesday morning.  If it comes in at even 8:31, our grade will be docked no less than 10%.  My topic?  Margaret Sanger, the birth control movement, her history/education/experiences and her contribution to nursing today.  I don't think this paper will be graded too harshly, as we've been advised by the prof that this is to help us introduce some basic elements of APA style.  Unfortunately, none of my earlier classes have used APA and I wasn't wise enough to learn it on my own.  Looks like we'll get an in-depth education into it these next two years, though.  Picked up a student loan refund check before leaving campus.  Nice to carry around that pseudo-cash for a while, pity it's all going to pay daycare.    Today's lectures were all about communication, listening, that sort of thing.  From assertive communication to interpreters, dealing with patients in distress/crying to responding to sarcasm.  Interesting stuff, and I could definately use to learn to be more assertive myself.    Goals for the weekend:  Get my paper written, and my furiously scribbled notes transcribed into a more neat typed format.  Thank goodness there's no prep (reading) assigned for our Monday group theory lecture.  Now it's off to have dinner with my parents, brother/SIL/their kids.  I don't turn down free food, especially when it's steak!   After that, I think the boys and I will head out to the next town over (25 miles) to spend the night with my in-laws.  My husband should be coming over there from his house sometime tomorrow...    Hope y'all have a great weekend.   "
3179,3877108,"08,July,2004",2004-07-08,"    I've got to get up away from this computer, study, and lay out our clothes and things for in the morning.  There's something to be said for organization.  But first, today's journal entry:  Had to stop for a double shot espresso first thing this morning.  I was nearly snoozing the whole drive there.  Going to be a long year.    The espresso ended up giving me a tummyache (not to mention I have a nervous tummy anyway), but I guess it was either be in pain or fall asleep in class.  I'm sure you know which of those two options seems more rational...  :)  Prayer request>That I don't sleep through my alarm (or turn it off in my sleep, which I've been known to do)!     First lecture this morning (4 hours worth) - communication, roles, Maslow, basic human needs, all that good stuff.  Dumb me went and bought a mini-tape recorder last night, but then walked off and left it at home today.  Back to the organization being key, again.  Get organized beforehand, there's a useful tip.    Our lecturer around lunch hour must have been competing for the Guiness World Records fastest speaker award.  We were all relieved to see she gave us handouts with a variety of terms on them.  Nevermind that none of them were used in her lecture, and just forget about trying to write down anything off her Powerpoint slides.  I hope she publishes them on the web later because the whole class was frustrated with that one.  I'll admit that I don't have a lot of sympathy for my classmates so far.  Am I bitter?  Maybe.   Jealous?  Maybe.  I'm not ruling out any possibilites.  Most of the conversations I heard this morning went as follows, ""did you do the assigned reading?""  The answers were mostly, ""well my boyfriend called..."" or ""I went to Hunt club and didn't get in..."" (local bar), etc etc etc.    Social cliques are already forming.  This is the South after all, and Southern culture still reigns.  Brand names everywhere.  I didn't know that big hair was still big.    So far on day two I'm still keeping to myself.  I guess I'm a loner.  I really did want to join my classmates when they were all laughing in the lounge during break, but I feel awkward.  I don't have much in common with these people yet.  Our conversations end at, ""so where are you from?"" and other such superficial statements.  Very frustrating for me.  I'm very shy, very self-conscious.    Distance and family obligations are going to prove a barrier for me in that area as well.  While other students can meet at the bar or in the library for a late night study group, I'm driving home, changing diapers, washing clothes, up with sick kids...  This afternoon we had a huge professionalism lecture.  We also went over things like writing goal/missin statements, facility and school philosophies, objectives, goals, etc.    In addition to that, we were divided up into our Cohort groups.  There are 4 per group, and this is who we'll work with for the rest of the semester on group projects.  We also practice skills and do labs with this group, as well as peer check-offs.  I think the only faculty check-offs we'll do will be vitals and enema/ostomy.  I've gone through at least 100 sheets of college rule paper already.  My handwriting is getting progressively worse.  Callouses are forming on my index finger.  My advice after 2 days:  buy stock in paper, black waterproof pens (not gel), highlighters....  It storms every afternoon here around 1:30.  Lightning, thunder, the works.  You'd think we were in the tropics.  Maybe it's an omen.  Regardless, a nice rainstorm always makes me want a nap...  A few questions.    What's the deal with the two terms patient and client?  Is one preferred as a general rule?  Our instructors seem to use both interchangeably.  Is there a secret to keeping sandwiches in a cooler from getting both mysteriously soggy and stale at the same time?  I had a nice soggy/stale ham and cheese sandwich for lunch, with some baby carrots, water, and a peppermint.  Now if only I could keep my diet so sensible in the evenings...  Anyone know a good program (PC based) for making and/or printing calendars?  I've got way too many things to keep track of, and each of our classes has individual calendars.  I'd like to streamline them all into one.  First quiz is tomorrow, first paper due Monday.  Need to get studying.  Got to go get Scantrons at the bookstore first thing in the morning before class.  We also have our first lab tomorrow: Universal Precautions.    Good night all, ""see"" you again this weekend.   "
3180,3877108,"07,July,2004",2004-07-07,"    Today in one word:  overwhelming.    I really thought I was ready.  My overconfidence is staggering.  :)  Started out bright and early:  up at 5:00 a.m., didn't even dress the boys - just rolled them out of bed in their PJ's and dropped them off at my mother's (my Dad takes them to daycare on his wya to work).  Thank heavens for my parents, otherwise I don't know how I'd manage.  Hats off to single parents without any kind of support system or network within their personal relationships.  Arrived to school early, around 7:45.  It's an hour commute each way, maybe 1 1/2 hours when the traffic's bad.  Lots of classmates were already there at that hour, though.  We all staked out good seats (in the front!) pretty early.  It's a very awkward shaped classroom we have.  They're remodeling a building on campus to serve as a brand new nursing department, but until its completion (next year) the building used in the meantime was once a dorm.  You can imagine, with all the walls knocked out, that the large support beams running through the middle of the now immense square rooms obstruct the view of the instructor and overhead quite a bit.    All morning, we had a sort of orientation.  Covering basic university and departmental policies, sexual harassment, grievance procedure, introduction of the 5 summer instructors, dress codes, etc.  We also had a library and computer resource lab tour.  Our schedule included a History of Nursing lecture, but we never got around to that.  After lunch (which I had in the cafeteria), we spent 4 hours non-stop listening to lecture and writing furiously, taking notes on universal/standard precautions, choosing, donning and removing PPE and infection control (basically a microbiology review).  Class let out at 4:30 and I think we all beat each other down getting out of there.  All of our lectures take place in the same room, so we stay put - only the instructors change.    There are 60 other students in my class.  Of those, maybe 3 including myself are married or have children.  There is one girl who is pregnant, due in September, right around the time we begin clinicals.  I told her she was a braver woman than I for undertaking that!  The only other ""adult"" student besides myself has grandchildren my children's age, an older Cajun lady from south Louisiana.  Maybe I should have tried the ASN program instead...  seems to be more non-trad students there?     Prayer request>That I find someone in my class to bond with.  Only one day in and I feel out of place, old, even alienated.  Lots of my classmates seem to know each other from pre-reqs or even high school (most early 20-somethings).  I'm hoping that I'll feel like I fit in more with time, it could just be my stranger-shyness peeking through.    So it was a very exciting day at school, I was thrilled to be there..  on the way home and once picking the kids up, I sort of had a meltdown.  Out of the classroom, my exhaustion and responsibilities are much more visceral.    On a nicer note, when I called my husband on his cell phone to see how work was going, he told me he was at my house.  I got there and he was washing dishes and taking out my trash - a very sweet surprise to get to see him and just kind of let things go, knowing he was in control.    I'm not sure if I can do this.  The 2-3 hours a day commuting, the 8 hours a day of class, the 2 little kids, the bills, the housework...   Even my grandmother asked, ""Are you sure you haven't bitten off more than you can chew?""  I guess there's no turning back now.    That's all for now.  You'll have to forgive my atrocious grammar, I call myself a stream of consciousness type writer, and I just let the words flow as they come out - not giving much thought to my spelling and punctuation.  I'll be glad to accept any constructive criticism, though.   "
3181,3877108,"05,July,2004",2004-07-05,"    Glad to have you here reading my blog.  Hope you enjoy seeing a little bit about what nursing school is like, or just catching up with me if you're someone I know or perhaps knew personally.  I'm going to make an effort to journal every day of my nursing school experience, but we'll see how big of an effort that becomes as time progresses.  Feel free to check back regularly for new postings!   A little background information on me, just in case...  27 years old.  Lived in MS all my life.  Small town, but I don't think I fit the associated stereotypes.  I have tattoos and live in a trailer though, so is that enough to be considered white trash?   LOL   :)  Shotgun marriage, going on 6 years.  My husband and I don't live together, but that's by necessity - not choice.  His job took him to a place I didn't care to move (the MS Delta - he's a service specialist for a commercial pest control company).  Two kids, both boys, ages 6 and 2 1/2.  Little one is still nursing and driving me crazy most of the time - typical toddler and a bully to boot.  Big one will be starting 1st grade in a few weeks.  Quit my full-time job last week.  Been working there as an engineering clerk for the past 6 years and doing school at night/online/part-time for the past 5.    Persistence pays off.

29302,3881689,"14,August,2004",2004-08-14,"    Dear Bish,  Donâ€™t mind if I call you, â€œBish?â€  Hope thatâ€™s not wrong (no pun intended).  The minister in my church keeps going on and on insisting that there is a Trinity and that itâ€™s in the Bible.  I find myself lining up more with what you say in your book, A New Christianity for A New Appetite. Should my pastor cling to this dogmatic doctrine?  Shelby Shelby, OH  Dear Shelby,  You seem to think you are a funny guy.  Please stop.  We canâ€™t all be Steve Martin and it always  amazes me how many people think they have a sense of humor.  Now, to your point.  Your minister, it seems to me, has a great deal of pride.  He makes the common mistake of imposing his interpretation of Scripture on the rest of us.  This, as you say, smacks of dogmatism, but not only that, a simplistic literalism compounded by an arrogance that says how you experience God must be the way he does.  This lack of awareness and education is astonishing in our churches.  I, for example never impose my views in an authoritarian way on my parishioners or my priests. And If I hear of any of them doing it, I put a stop to it immediately and punish the offenders.  How can we presume to know what and who God is? Who am I to say my interpretation of the Scripture is correct or better than anyone elseâ€™s?  What hubris!   The trinity is a concept invented by a fourth century church council, not something Jesus, Peter or Paul talked about.  Oh, I know they talked about a Father, a Son and a Holy Spirit, and about these three persons being God, but since the word â€œtrinityâ€ isnâ€™t used I like to say that it isnâ€™t a biblical concept.  Works for me.  Whatâ€™s important to grasp is your experience of the divine.  This is something, along with your education at a reputable, non-evangelical university, that you can always trust.  I feel the spirit when I do my many good deeds and acts of charity.  I encounter the Son when I am inspired to give a large portion of my paycheck to the needy.  I see a pattern in the flow of history, a presence closer than my breath that speaks of the Father.  This is why I choose a Christian interpretation of the divine.  But do you see me condemning my Buddhist, Hindu, Islamic or Wicca brothers and sisters because they do not encounter the divine the same way.  Hardly!  If your minister continues to insist on this tired, old reading of Christianity, I suggest you find another congregation to worship in.  And by all means purchase my book, The Way I See It: The Death of Objective Logic.  It can be yours for a donation of $49.95.  Annually.  Yours Always, Rong   "
29303,3881689,"05,August,2004",2004-08-05,"    Dear Bishop Rong,  Iâ€™ve just finished reading Tom Brokawâ€™s The Greatest Generation. The stories of sacrifice for the benefit of future generations reminded me of Christâ€™s unselfish sacrifice for us. Several accounts in the book moved me to tears. Being a regular reader of your column, I would love to hear your thoughts on the World War II generation and their Christian example.  Sim South Dakota   Dear Sim,  Iâ€™m sure Mr. Brokaw did a wonderful job of storytelling. I certainly have strong emotions for individuals who lived during the difficult times of the 30â€™s and 40â€™s, including my own mother and father.  However, I am sure you are not ignorant of the atrocities committed by White European males in this country and elsewhere for centuries. From George Washingtonâ€™s owning of slavesâ€”I have never even thought about doing such an atrocious thing!â€”to white settlersâ€™ massacre of innocent, peaceful, Native Americans on their way to steal their lands.  Neither, Sim, should we stoop to solving our disputes with the evils of war. Both the current President and his WWII pilot and Iraq-invading father have chosen to settle their personal disputes with the violent deaths of our young men and women, not to mention thousands of innocent Iraqis. (Do you see a pattern here, or is it just me?).  Perhaps the root of this behavior is the idea of the very event you mention. Many people, like you, Sim, misinterpret the story of the bloody sacrifice that many have portrayed as the focal point of Christianity. Nothing could be further from the truth. Jesusâ€™ message was about peace and life and tolerance. Fortunately, through popular books like  The Da Vinci Code  which take evidence from the recently discovered Nag Hamadi texts, the real story of Jesus is finally coming to the light of day. Jesus, it is now known, probably lived his days out in peace, living with a woman who bore him children. This is not what the winners in history, the calculating writers of the New Testament want you to believe.  As you know, I took part in the Jesus Seminar, which by painstaking scholarly inquiry proved most of the New Testament to not be the sayings of Jesus at all! It is unlikely that these documents, which suppressed the role of women and minorities in the real story of the early church, portray any real event in the life of Jesus at all.  After all, you don't still believe that God created the earth in literal six days, do you? How about Noah's flood? Jonah in the belly of the whale? A vengeful God who destroys people for living out their sexual preference? These ridiculous ideas should be wiped from our memory along with the judgemental attitude they inspire.  So you see, the bloody crucifixion, with its example of violence to solve problems, is an event fabricated by men at some early church council, who decided their version of events was right. Thus, they precluded and destroyed all other views. This bloody event did indeed inspire the World War II generation. It inspired the German Christians and the Anglo Christians to murder each other, not to mention many millions of Jews.  If this historically questionable event inspired your parents or you, your tears should be tears of shame, not piety. I suggest you read my book,  How I know Everything Perfectly and Objectively from a Distance of 2000 Years . Send 69.95 and I will ensure you and parents all get a copy.   "

5022,3893150,"22,July,2004",2004-07-22,"   so yesterday was pretty cool. my friends, Bartlett (Devon) and Reynolds (Jeremy) came over. we sat around, watched Boondock Saints and discussed the many ways to make and eat a PB&amp;J. also had a nice discussion on how kids today are not as innocent as kids were when we were kids. I personally think it started with Super Mario Bros. 2. what a fucking trip, you have to be a savante to finish that game, without going insane, that is. but it's true. the worst thing we had as kids was Mortal Kombat. nowadays, kids have The Suffering, Manhunt, Max Payne, GTA. certainly not bad games, but still..kids are getting desensitized...which isn't a good thing. but whatever, I'm sounding a little too grizzled for a 16 year old. later that night, we met up with my other friend Farrell (Andrew) and played some water frisbee, sans Devon. good times. for the next three minutes, I have to help my dad with our cabin..it's finally getting taken off the stilts it's been sitting on for 12 years and put in a foundation. so I'll be working on that until saturday evening. it's my punishment for not having a job. better than flipping greasy cowheads all day I guess. I guess thats it for now. "
5023,3893150,"19,July,2004",2004-07-19,"   ok...so my week consisted mostly of watching movies and playing vice city. I spent the wonderful day with Claire last wednesday so we know that. but yeh...I had some movies rented, so I watched them. one a day for five days. good-ness. watched Dazed And Confused, Up In Smoke, Half-Baked, Game Of Death and Boondock Saints. and some others on TV and what not. now, prepare for a little spiel here. it's taken me quite some time to see Boondock Saints. came out in 1999. I've heard about the movie for a while, from random friends from forums and reading threads about it on IMDb. I'm kicking myself now for&nbsp;not seeing it sooner...one of the most stylish movies I've seen since I first seen Kill Bill. so well shot..everything about it I loved. Willem DaFoe owned, as usual. he's one of the most underrated actors in Hollywood. so versatile. also seen Spiderman 2 tonight, with claire and some of her friends. I'd say it lived up to the hype and everything. not extremely polar-opposite from other superhero movies, but it was developed well..with the Peter/MJ love struggle thing and what not. good times. the third movie is gonna be cool, although I think every Spidey fan in the world is waiting for the movie with Venom and Carnage and all those cool cats. yeh...maybe that's it for now? claire is leaving tomorrow. thats sad...but she should be back soon. hopefully. tata, internet stalkers. "
5024,3893150,"14,July,2004",2004-07-14,"   just spent the day with one of the best people in the world, Claire Barbour. honestly, she is one of my favorite people in the entire world and I'm a better person having met her. we sat around all day, talking about everything, catching up. we went for a walk out around, watched The Neverending Story with subtitles in Spanish. one of the best days I've ever had. "
5025,3893150,"11,July,2004",2004-07-11,"   driving today, I swirved into the other lane and almost took out some lady in a silver Windstar. I was staring at a fat lady having a yard sale on the side of the road, dressed in her pyjamas. hicks fascinate me way too much. "
5026,3893150,"10,July,2004",2004-07-10,"   OK so this is my first post in my new blog. well, I suppose I should get to the personal bs.  I'm a 16 year old kid from Newfoundland, in Canada. I'm pretty normal for my age, I think. I like watching movies, playing frisbee, hanging out with pals and the occasional pinner. as far as movies go, I'm a big Quentin Tarantino fan. love all his stuff. I like the LOTR series, Trainspotting, Kevin Smith's stuff, The Godfather: Part 2 and The Goonies. music..favorite bands are the Misfits, Queen, Talking Heads, The Clash, Alexisonfire, Dropkick Murphys, Gwar and Radiohead. that it? I think so.  that should be ok for now. I'll update again when somethign interesting happens. "
5027,3893150,"12,August,2004",2004-08-12,"   friend o' mine, Katie, had a party. close to 20 people in a very cozy house. smoked some cannons and hotboxed a bathroom. watched Enemy At The Gates with my dill pickle-lovin' compadre Reynolds. what did YOU do last night?  PS: I have a new AIM with no one on it. jacktheworld13. add me if you're reading this. "
5028,3893150,"03,August,2004",2004-08-03,"   so last weekend, it was family-o-rama. went to my grandparents house and spent some time with relatives who were home for a visit. it seems as though every person I've ever known that moved away was home this summer at some point. didn't get to see all of them, which was a bummer. anywho, family time all last weekend. picked up a couple books when I was out there, too. Bankok 8 by John Burdett. about a cop in Bangkok who witnesses the murder of an American marine and his partner. big conspiracy, who-can-you-trust thriller. damn good. well, I got home that sunday, just chilled out monday. Tuesday, me and Reynolds went swimming and we smoked up. good times. chilled out on my own the rest of the week. whole lotta PS2 and movies went down. Friday, went out with Bartlett, Reynolds and Shauna. met up with Farrell later on. smoked a doober around 12, hung out at a playground, being high fools for a couple hours. didn't do anything over the weekend. maybe swimming later tonight...maybe not.  on a sidenote, I have this sick fascination with trash TV that comes on really late at night, roundabouts 4 am here. shit like Jerry Springer, Elimidate...it just makes me laugh. I'm glad there's fools like this to keep me occupied during the wea morning hours.  this summer has flown by. I have a supplementary math exam one month from today.  gotta start studying for that sometime soon...within the next couple of weeks, for sure. fuck man....my last year of high school. never thought I'd see the day. King Of The School, baby! hah...not likely. I guess that's it for now. it being 4:35 in the PM, I should probably get dressed and showered soon. chow. "
26745,3893735,"12,July,2004",2004-07-12,"   Ok heres the deal, im an agry young man, I'v got alot going on in my life at the moment. But every single teenager in the world does, so I cant complain about this, coz my situation isn't bad.  GIRL troubles- Every 17 year old guy knows what I'm talking about! You chicks are crazy! Feelings changing more often than a baby's nappy... I still love you, but not as a GF! Hoping that you realise how much you mean to me as a friends some day soon, then maybe we can spend time together.  FRIEND troubles- Now this is messed up! Wouldnt you think that the boys you hang out with for 3 years are ya best mates! Well obviously not, as I'v found out recently! Teenage guys can be worse than chicks, they love backstabbing each other, the problem is when you start to do it to you're own group of friends.  DEATH issues- I really dont wanna accept this whole death thing, everybody dies... but this is my greatest fear in life! Losing the people that i care for the most, its like all of you'r love has gone to waste or somthing... Once i can accept this I will be there for my friend who needs me.  SCHOOL problems- School has to be the most boring place on earth! Everyday i go there do my lessons, then at recess and lunch times i just walk around from group to group talkin to random people, some ppl who i really like i avoid, I cant hack that either.  MAKING the RIGHT decision- Thers another problem i'm gonna be facing soon, thats what to do when i leave school, which i really wanna drop out of! I need to decide where i want my life to go, I love art... But im lazy, to be successful in the art world it takes motivation.  {A CONFLICT INSIDE ME} Thers all of these emotions inside me at the moment, anger, love, hate, lust ect... Its pretty hard for me to act happy while i dont know how i'm feeling, its so strange... theres only one person that makes me truely happy, but there alot of great friends that can cheer me up... I guess I'v been down these holidays because I dont have a GF and my mates seem to be busy every day.  BORED AS A MF!!! Need a CHANGE of scenery. well not as a mf, coz at least then i'd be doin somthing lol... All this time alone, makes me think about times that were better, places i wish i could go back to, ppl i wish i could be with again, i wanna go back to europe live there for like a couple of years. Anyone wanna come with me??? It'l be mad fun. "

26748,3893735,"13,July,2004",2004-07-13,"    Well as of yesterday i decided to forget all my troubles and move on with my life... easier said than done! Yesterday was the most exhausting day of my life, i went to the city with cam and bartles... was there a shop in the city that we didnt look at? NO!!! When we finally left cam was trying to convince the two of us to come to some Hunters dance party? bartles was smart and quickly went home, but being the sucker that i am i went back to cam's house. there duane soon showed up and they convinced me that it would be worth coming to, lies! We picked up some drinks and left for sutherland. When we got there to buy tickets some stoners where talking to duane so we couldnt get tickets! Woohoo, well thats what i thought till cam went back and got some... at this stage it was about 7pm, the stupid party didnt start till 7.30 and we had a bag full of alcohole, so we had to drink it down fast!  We stumbled into this over crowded hall thingy full of like year 9 and 10 kids! Im like, you guys came here to pick up??? desperate kids!!! as it turned out most of the night i spent sitting at the bar, while those two tried to get close to little girls, HAHAHA. I guess im the only one of us who didnt go to pick up... just not ready and it seems a lil sleezy, rather get to know chicks first... but thats just me lol.  By 10.30 i was wishing for a quick and painless death!!! it was so hot in there, and all these shire kids were prancing around :s... NOT MY SCENE, at 11.30 we made a group decision to get the hell outta there, the two boys didnt get close to picking up and i needed some tucker!   Caught the train to oatley and walked down to the bp in mortdale, where those two clowns were joking about being starving! when i was, so i boaght a whole bbq chicken at 12am and ate half on the way back to cam's house...  *reminder to self... never buy chicken from bp! then i msg'd about 5 ppl when i was at cams house lol, yeh ppl are gonna reply at 12.30??? well actually a few did, so i was like... woohoo!!!  Now im pretty down, coz i spent all my money yesterday on stupid shit! like a $10 chicken which i ended up throwing at a car and drinks which i didnt drink!!! Meant to go back to the city on thursday and drinking thursday night at olds or sumthin... sounds pretty stupid, but if people come it will be ok, then meant to be goin footy fri night... but this isnt gonna happen without funding!   Now im gonna go get some excercise to work off that chicken from last night lol, hope this has been an interesting experience for you all... reading the boring truth about my life...   "
18459,3894428,"16,July,2004",2004-07-16,"   So um yea..my night    sux   .&nbsp;  I was   suposed to   go to Krome w/ Kelly and Cassie..But my mother screwed that all up. So I'm spending my night   home alone  ..with my dog Ivo..  Cutting myself  . This just royally sux. My mom had said she thought that cassie seemed kind of   selfish  ..and the more I think about it..the more true it is. Like the only time she wants to hang out w/ me..or even talk to me is when I'm with Kelly..or when they're hanging out and Kelly wants me to come. We used to be   BEST  &nbsp;friends..and now we're   barely even   friends. She moved closer, and instead of helping our relationship..it just recked it. I was rite wen I said Kelly was taking   my   life over..and it's gets truer and truer each day.   "
18460,3894428,"12,July,2004",2004-07-12,"   Yest. I went over to Kelly's for the night.   [-] I only got 5.5 hours of sleep last night..  [-] Micheal will NOT stop making fun of me for being short..okay I can tolerate it the first, i dunno, 100 times from the same people, but after that it gets really annoying...really.  [+] We went swimming last night.  [-] I can't hang out w/ Kelly with out Mike being there. It's really pissing me off. She always invites him along EVERYTIME we hang out. Personally, I find him really annoying and immature. Plus, he likes me, and I swear to God if he doesn't stop touching me I'm going to deck him.  [+] As of last night I quit smoking..it's disgusting.  [-] I gained 5 more pounds..I'm now 122.  [-] I have an hour long violin lesson..  [-] It's raining.   "

The first time I heard it I thought it was crap..but now that I think of it..it's true.   My friends have been bumming me out a lot lately. Just the stupid things set me off. My two best friends (both of whom hated each other before I finally got them to talk..and I was friends w. both long before they even knew each other existed) hang out all the time w/o me. This includes my birthday that was like two weeks ago. It makes me so mad, and it's the stupidest thing in the world. But I guess if they didnt mean so much to me it really wouldnt matter to me..would it?   I'm also a very jealous person. At least over some things. Like if I got hurt by a guy I was with, and he started going out w/ someone else, I'll hate that person for pretty much no reason - for indirectly pissing me off. It really wouldn't matter if that guy hadn't meant anything to me. I dunno..a bit of thought for my night.   "

19528,3903607,"12,July,2004",2004-07-12,"   We have a few days left in Japan before flying to Germany. To round off our trip here we are taking the train to Hakone tomorrow to catch a glimpse (hopefully) of Fuji San.  Jess's boyfriend, Ben, returned from his work trip the other day and since then we have had much more of the local beer and seen some interesting nightscapes. Ben is fluent in English, Japanese and American.  Prior to Ben's return, Louise and I were using ""pigeon-nippongo"" to get by, which apart from being frightfully funny, is completely unhelpful. A request for a ticket from Yogi Bear station (Yoyogi) to Dog-on-a-tuckerbox (Takadabobaba) would be met with a long-winded, rehearsed and passionate account of Japan's imperial history, with particular emphasis on the nasty invading hordes, who they called ""gaijin"" and who they clearly did not care for much.  Apart from the ticket guy, everyone here has been incredibly friendly and considerate. I personally love this place, life here is so different to Australia - however - from what I have seen, Japanese people tend to spend much more of their time existing than living. There are so many places where it is not socially acceptable to talk (like trains, small retaurants or any confined spaces), and their culture and code of conduct seems so strict that quirky features have popped up (like all-age comic book reading, rebellious fashion, and popular fetishism).  Having said that, we are yet to meet a young Japanese person who is not cool. They all seem to spend so much money on their clothes and haircuts, it has put Louise and me to shame.  After I finish this blog, we are going to the world's largest fish market near Ginza. We have been warned to wear old shoes. The Tokyo Lonely Planet reports that some tuna fish fetch 2 million yen each (nearly 13 thousand AUD)! I will settle for just a slice at the local Sushi Train, thank you.  Until next time, please feel free to post your comments! Love to all.  "

We only managed to walk for 15 minutes to the train station before suffering from heat exhaustion and deciding it was too much effort to actually board a train. We took refuge in a supermarket instead where it was cool and browsed the isles looking at all the different types of local food. It was great fun and we spent nearly 2 hours at it!  We have spent some considerable time sampling the local beer from the comfort of Jess`s massage chair and hope to get out and about in the next couple of days.  We have no access to the mobile phone network here. Sorry if you were awaiting a response to a message you have left us...

3322,3924062,"15,July,2004",2004-07-15,"   I've just been thinking of revising the lyrics to my debut single (perhaps I'll post a draft - if someone reading this wants me to, leave a comment), when I sought inspiration in another song.  Now, as soon as I thought of a pop song to take ideas from, I thought only one thing.  Busted.  Inserting their debut album (their finest, and I can justify it being in my record collection as it was bought for me - it would surely be rude not to listen to it?) and skipping to 'Year 3000', I sat back and prepared for aural pleasure (innuendo most probably intended...).   I won't lie to you, listening to that song has probably given me a clue as to how Busted are so successful.  Think about it.  They've been to the Year 3000.  Do they not know the way the charts are going to pan out for the next 996 years?  Does this not grant them the surefire way to construct a song that will cater for the changing needs of the increasingly picky pop audience?  Or am I simply reading too far into this?  Only the future of Busted will tell...  "
3323,3924062,"14,July,2004",2004-07-14,"   I've just realised the overwhelming burden of pressure, both from the expectations of myself and others, to succeed. I would say I can't sleep because of it, but its only 11.44am, so what the hell.  "
3324,3924062,"14,July,2004",2004-07-14,"   What is in a name?  They give us an identity, something people can call us, to distinguish us from the rest of the mob - unless of course you're in a mob of people with the same name as you, but thats statistically unlikely, isn't it? Of course,with a debut single in the pipeline, my thoughts must turn to my name.  Is Robert Pook (my full name, to those who may read this blog and know me only as Rob) a jazzy name, full of the sparkling pizazz associated with showbiz, parties and the luxurious lifestyle of someone famous.  In short, it isn't.  Now, I'm not a group, so that rules out the pluralular (probably made that up...) style of name such as Westlife, 5ive, even the Spice Girls.  No, I need something short, punchy, something that hundreds of thousands of childrens can utter across their school playgrounds as soon as the new charts are announced, or following my appearance in Smash Hits magazine.  Darius.  Look at that, a successful popstar known only by his first name.  But Robert just doesn't have that ring, nor does Rob, Bob, Bert, just about anything that can be made using my humble little name.  I would go for Pook, it has been a nickname of mine for many years.  I say a nickname...its just my surname, so I guess it doesn't really work as a nickname of such.  But surely Pook corners me in as a performer aimed at the preschool category.  I want to have some credibility as a popstar, not be thought of as some bloke in a brightly coloured rotund costume who dances around singing old nursery rhymes but with the new politically correct lyrics.  All together now...""Humpty Dumpty sat on the wall, Humpty Dumpty had a great fall.  All the Legal Aid Companies and Lawyers to boot, ensured he got compensated with plenty of loot!"". Perhaps I'll just change my name entirely?  Ramon, Diego, Carlos...something continental.  Ramon Valera...that could corner a market if I work on my dark, latin-based smouldering good looks?  You see, this is the trouble of the market.  I don't just need to be a good musician, in fact, I don't need to be a musician at all - which is rather good as far as I'm concerned.  No, all I need to be is a package.  An image, a look, a name.  ...this should be fun.  "
3325,3924062,"14,July,2004",2004-07-14,"   Now, we come to the effective 'construction' of my debut single, my first stab at the heart of pop stardom.  Continuing this analagy further, if I succeed, I will find my hands immersed in the warm scarlet blood of fame.  If I fail, I'll just hit the pancreas, joining many other failed acts such as One True Voice (where did it all go wrong?), Fast Food Rockers (I think we can see where that one went wrong) and Daphne and Celeste (see previous brackets).  Whilst this may not knock the Pop Industry dead, it will simply cause a minor injury, slowing it down, flagging it.  Like a wounded wildebeest, falling back in the moving herd - prime targets for the lions, the other genres such as Rock and Hip Hop.  Now, time for some cold hard facts.  My debut single will be self-financed (hence my profile listing my occupation as 'non-profit' - I expect none whatsoever).  It will be a preliminary batch of 50 copies.  Hopefully, these will sell, and possibly fetch me up to Â£20 profit for charity.  With any luck, I will join the vast swathing ranks of the Charity Single Superstars.  Think Geldof, Bono, Band Aid, S Club 7, Gareth Gates.  My name will join them in lights.  In theory.  And there'll be a video.  I already have a slight demo for the single.  Its entitled 'The One Who Proposed'.  As you may imagine, its about being the one who proposed, but being rejected.  The lyrics are, if I say so myself, jaunty, a little streetwise, a la Busted.  The demo was written, performed and recorded in one live take (after many hours practising alone in a darkened room) using only a basic laptop and a twelve year old keyboard.  Now, we come to the crucial stages.  Over the next few days, I need to jazz it up, give it that extra something.  We need a brass section, an unnecessarily long percussion intro, a synthesized middle-8 in which I can arse around in during the promotional video, we need a dance routine...  ...more will follow.  "

16335,3929371,"22,July,2004",2004-07-22,"   Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears;  I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.  The evil that men do lives after them;  The good is oft interred with their bones;  So let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus  Hath told you Caesar was ambitious:  If it were so, it was a grievous fault,  And grievously hath Caesar answer'd it.  Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest -  For Brutus is an honourable man;  So are they all, all honourable men -  Come I to speak in Caesar's funeral.  He was my friend, faithful and just to me:  But Brutus says he was ambitious;  And Brutus is an honourable man.  He hath brought many captives home to Rome  Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill:  Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?  When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept:  Ambition should be made of sterner stuff:  Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;  And Brutus is an honourable man.  You all did see that on the Lupercal  I thrice presented him a kingly crown,  Which he did thrice refuse: was this ambition?  Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;  And, sure, he is an honourable man.  I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,  But here I am to speak what I do know.  You all did love him once, not without cause:  What cause withholds you then, to mourn for him?  O judgment! thou art fled to brutish beasts,  And men have lost their reason. Bear with me;  My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar,  And I must pause till it come back to me.   "

16337,3929371,"02,August,2004",2004-08-02,"   Ok. Maybe qualifying something from Shakespeare as an official blog is way too much to ask. But isn't it a nice o'l speech, eh? And a fitting one, at that, for my hopefully rewarding dip into the world of non-private thinking.  A great orator such as Marc Antony tends to make his audience believe that what he is saying is TRUE, regardless of the righteousness of the idea. That 'Friends, Romans, countrymen' speech was immortalized by that very nature -- its  use of rhetoric to affect emotions and spur action in the process.  By posting that speech, I had just imposed upon myself something of a precedent for how things should work around here. I'm not saying I can persuade anyone into action, or lure someone into a pipe dream by my mere soliluquy. All I'm saying is perhaps, my rants, raves, and eternal damnation of the organized majority can be viewed in such light as PURPOSEFUL. Non-censorship of web contents guarantees me freedom for cussing and screwing anything and anyone, but by golly -- be it for some intent other than satisfying myself.  There'd be some sporadic trivial and inconsequential stuff here too, sure, but hey it isn't fun talking about serious matters all the time.  As the great Oscar Wilde oh-so-aptly puts it -- ""Seriousness is the only refuge of the shallow.""  So, there.  By the way, it took me a while to understand what was behind Marc Antony's speech, so if I were you, I'd go back on that post and read it again. It's beauty and classic appeal had just dawned upon me on my 10th, no make it 15th, intentful re-reading.   "
17475,3930072,"19,July,2004",2004-07-19,"   Stupid fucker.  So I wake up this morning to go to practice and come downstairs to a lovely little message Jeff sent me on AIM. It basically tells me to stop putting things in my profile about him and if I want to say something to his face then I should call. It also says he's sorry things have to be this way but I've obviously made it clear that they do. Of course, he was much more eloquent than that about the whole thing.  Alright. I'm only half guilty.  Maybe the ""If you don't give a damn I don't give a fuck"" was somewhat directed at him.  But the ""I'm sorry, I'm allergic to bullshit"" I put as my away message was a quote from I,Robot, which I saw yesterday in the theater. I just thought it was funny.  And I'll probably tell him that the other message was about something else.   In fact, I have a pretty good idea of what I'll say. It goes something like this:  ""Look. You need to stop thinking of yourself so highly. That stuff in my profile isn't about you. The away message was a funny quote from the movie I,Robot and the ""I don't give a fuck"" was about something else entirely, more as a joke than anything. Coincidentally, it just happens to fit the way things are between us. So what. I told you I was done, and I am. It isn't about you anymore. Although I don't see why you give a damn about what I say about you or how I feel. You never did before. I'm sorry if I make you look the ass that you are, but maybe it'd do you some good to think about what you've done to me. But of course you won't. Because it's all about you.""  Or maybe I won't say any of it.   I probably won't even call.  I'm just so sick of this all. "

And you say I only hear what I want to: I don't listen hard, I don't pay attention to the distance that you're running or to anyone, anywhere, I don't understand if you really care, I'm only hearing negative: no, no, no (bad)  And so I, I turned the radio on, I turned the radio up and this woman was singin' my song: the lover's in love and the other's run away, the lover is cryin' 'cuz the other won't stay.  Some of us hover when we weep for the other who was dieing since the day they were born. Well, this is not that: I think that I'm throwing, but I'm thrown.  And I thought I'd live forever, but now I'm not so sure.  You try to tell me that I'm clever, but that won't take my anyhow, or anywhere with you.

It's pretty accurate except for the part about staying. But most of the phrases are so true. Yeah...  The trip to Kohls was a success, however. I got a cute white tank with a green flower pin, a lightweight gray cardigan, and an awesome belt that's bright and colorful with little nostalgia pics on it.   I tried on some bras as well but that, as usual, was a failure. I mean, I tried on that one brand with sizes like ""nearly A"" and ""nearly B.""  I can even fit a nearly A.  How embarrassing.  On a better note, I've finally decided on all the outfits for my senior pictures. I picked out six just in case. They are as follows:  1. cute blue strapless dress with white polka dots 2. plaid pants and red halter 3. jeans and maroon polo 4. abercrombie track jacket and jeans 5. new white tank with flower pin and jean skirt 6. brown top with white lacey skirt and striped scarf  I'm pretty excited about this. A lot less stress, you know, once you have your outfits picked out.  I think I'll get back to watching the Olympic track and field trials now. "
17477,3930072,"15,July,2004",2004-07-15,"   Thunderstorm.   I started watching Fight Club (just picked up the DVD today) but the rain and thunder is so loud I can't concentrate on the movie.   I've got to stop eating. I mean, I wasn't really hungry but I just went into the kitchen and opened a bag of chips to munch on.   So I munched. And munched. By the handful, at that.   Which is bad.   Food is NOT therapy.   Hah. If there was anything good about me being depressed and shit after the whole breakup thing was that I didn't feel like eating. Every time I felt full I wanted to puke. Every time I thought about what happened my stomach would do a backflip.   With a round-off and a half twist.   So yeah, I totally dropped a few pounds and now I'm back to eating chips. All of a sudden, though, I realized I should be drinking fluids instead because of the bladder thing.   It was more like I realized I hadn't peed in a couple hours.   So the trusty water bottle is back by my side, though I'm not quite sure I will reach the 104 ounces I consumed yesterday. Ah, well, I don't need to run tomorrow so fluid intake isn't quite as important.   Oh. I got the results yesterday from the AP biology exam I took in the spring.   I scored a three...   ...out of five, that is!   I must say I was rather excited. I didn't know what the fuck I was doing on the test and I wasn't expecting to get a passing score but I guess you never know.   Who says bullshitting won't get you anywhere?   Actually, no one says that. We all know it's how we passed (or are passing) high school.   Which isn't to say one must always bullshit. My theory is, put the real effort into what you like to do, when you want to do it. Bullshit when you don't care. Bullshit when you want to save time.   Bullshit when the task at hand is bullshit.   Example. English teachers are big on the rough draft thing. You always gotta write a rough draft and do the peer editing and self editing crap before you can turn in your paper. But nine times out of ten the teacher doesn't even read what the hell you wrote. They just check 'em to see if they're done and give you 10 points credit or whatever. But writing always has to be a fucking process.   Well, I despise rough drafts. I loathe them. They are the biggest waste of time ever. So what do I do? I bullshit them. You can, too. Here's how:   1. Write in cursive. Sloppily.  2. Skip lines.  3. Use wide-ruled paper.  4. Make sure you have five paragraphs no matter what.  5. If you feel ambitious, write a great intro so the teacher thinks the rest of the paper is great.  6. If it's a research paper, include long direct quotes.   It's easy. Then you usually have another week or so to write your real paper. I mean, you aren't going to turn in the bullshit draft as the final one. No way. You're going to write a fucking awesome paper and get a 97% on it, but you don't have to deal with the bullshit of a rough draft. Because it's the real paper that's important. You put your heart and soul into that shit.   Rant. Rant. Rant.   What was I talking about anyway?   Oh yeah, AP bio. In short, I didn't take time to study for the exam but bullshitted the essays and was lucky on the multiple choice and I got a three. Ta da.   This means at State I can waive three biological science entry classes--BS110, BS111, and BS111L and start at a higher level.   You know, I was thinking. Here I am and I'm smart. I got a 29 on the ACT, not to mention a 35 on the English part which is in the 99th percentile. I got a three on the AP bio exam so I can skip frosh classes in college. Then I was thinking, not only am I smart, but I'm athletic. I've been all-city, all-conference, all-regional and all-state in both cross country and track. I can run in the low 19:00s for a 5k. And then I was thinking, not only and I smart, athletic, but I'm artistic, too. I've won first place at student expo three years in a row for drawing, ceramics, and painting, respectfully. So here I am and I got all this talent and brains and ability and yet, I lost the one thing that made me truly happy.   Sigh.   I know my life shouldn't revolve around something so fleeting, but I guess it was just that important to me. He was important to me. Being in love made everything different. It was new and special and I don't know. And I wonder if I'm destined to have everything everyone wants but not the one the thing everyone has that I want. &nbsp; Blah blah blah. &nbsp; Excuse the self-pity. &nbsp; I just wonder if I've lost it all for good. &nbsp; "
17478,3930072,"15,July,2004",2004-07-15,"   Well I did it.  I told Jeff I don't want to do this friendship  thing anymore. That I can't. That I am so angry, so hurt, it's impossible for this to work.  I told him goodbye.  But goddamn all I feel right now is like crying. I can't bring back all of the anger I felt before. I can't find that jealous little pang in my heart when I'd see him with Kara. I just feel miserable.  It was just like a film. I half expected to turn around and see Steven Spielberg and a camera rolling over my shoulder. We had it down to an art, really: standing at the doorway, looking into each other's eyes for the last time, one final kiss on the forehead, the fateful ""goodbye,"" walking away, turning around for one last glance...  I guess everything still feels like the movies.  Just not the good kind anymore.  I know I had to do it or else I'll never heal. But every day there's going to be something I want to share with him, and everyday I will miss him. And I guess I wish one day he'll call me up and say, ""Jen, I can't live without you"" but the chances of that are slim. He doesn't need me anymore and he's always been so much better at this kind of thing. He'll move on.  I'm scared I may never see him again.  I had to do this partly because I was sick of being the one who called, the one who said ""hey, let's hang out."" It was so hard because I feel he never made the effort for this friendship that I did. I was the consolation prize when Kara was busy, the backup when he needed something to do. So I walked away.  I don't know if he'll ever really miss me. He's good at finding distractions to prevent thinking.  I know I'll live.   I made a vow to stop denying how I feel, however. Whether it's right or wrong there's just one thing I wish circumstances would have permitted me to say to Jeff yesterday:  I love you. "
17479,3930072,"14,July,2004",2004-07-14,"   I had just an awful run today. I was shooting for five miles but by the time I reached Minges three and a half was looking good. I forced myself to make it through four but it was the worst run I've had this whole summer. No joke. It was one of those utterly-exhausted-feet-dragging-if-I-have-to-go-up-one-more-hill-I'm-going-to-die runs where you seriously don't think you're going to make it.  I blame the antibiotics.  Which pisses me off to no end because I have to take those damn pills for ten days and the Riverfront Run is in nine. If I'm going to feel like I did today there's no way in hell I'm going to run that race. I'd rather not collapse on the course or even worse run an embarrassingly slow time.   So it can be said I came home from practice rather grumpy. And then, while I sat at the computer, angrily sipping red Gatorade, Clarissa IMs me out of the blue.  ""Hey. I have a question.""  I'm like ok, go for it. And you'll never guess what she asks me.  She invites me to go with her to Chicago next week to the Art Institute.  Yes, the Art Institute of Chicago. That museum in Ferris Bueller's Day Off. The one with all the famous paintings. The one she told me about last year when she went and the one I've wanted to go to forever.   Oh my God.  My mood does a complete turn around. All of a sudden I'm smiling and my heart is light and I just can't stop thanking her enough for inviting me and for thinking of me and I feel great. It was a crazy coincidence because I was in such a bad mood before and this opportunity came at the perfect moment. I mean, to a lot of people this wouldn't be a big deal (it's just a museum) but to me a trip to the AIC is exactly what I need.  Times like these make me think the big guy in the sky is looking out for us after all. "
17480,3930072,"14,July,2004",2004-07-14,"   I went to the doctor today for what I assumed was a bladder infection or UTI or whatever they call them in the business. They gave me antibiotics and pills to numb my bladder so I can pee without pain. Hah. It's rather interesting because the bladder-numbing stuff makes my urine a bright orange color, like macaroni and cheese.  It's exactly the same color as my Nalgene water bottle.  So I slept a lot today and sulked around the house because even though my body feels fine having an infection gives one the perfect excuse to mope about. No one gets on you about it because they assume you feel like shit and if they do say anything you simply reply, ""Shut up. I have an infection.""  It works 95% of the time.  This is all great for me because if I didn't have an inflamed bladder or bacteria in my urethrea there's no way I could go around feeling sorry for myself or being pissed off at the world.  It's not like I don't have a good reason to do so. I do.  But ""my ex-boyfriend is a stupid bastard who doesn't give a fucking damn about my feelings or being my friend like he said he would and while he's off in Candyland with his new girl after a post-break-up period of less than three weeks I am seriously considering cutting off his dick while he sleeps and tossing it out the window of a moving car"" won't really cut it with the female Nazis of the household who insist I just ""get over it.""  I suppose I can handle a little burning while I piss just to get some peace when I'm unhappy.  I didn't run today, but it's alright. I'll make up the five miles tomorrow when everyone else plays frisbee.  Although, such an aggressive game would provide the perfect opportunity to smash in Kara's pretty face or kick her in the shins.  Did I just say that?  Did I mention Jeff's new girl is my fucking teammate?  Anyway. Maybe tomorrow during my run I will be able to enjoy the sound of the wind in the trees or the solitary pounding of my Mizunos on pavement instead of Lindsay's incessant chatter in my ear. I love the girl to death but she talks so much and out of courtesy at least I feel like I should respond to what she says.  It's called conversation or something.  Dad's about to come home with burgers for dinner so at least I can indulge in some greasy cow intestine, although after watching Compassion Over Killing's documentary on farm animal cruelty, vegetarianism is looking more appealing than ever.

24294,3931951,"02,August,2004",2004-08-02,"    Howdy.       My weekend has been terrific. It started early, since my best friend's birthday was on Thursday. She had a party at Aimee's (my other best friend) house and we all got really hammered. Tiff (my best friend) and I hung out pretty much the entire night, and we had a great time doing it. It was fun. Lots and lots of fun.       Friday night was a dead night here in town. There weren't any parties unless you were willing to drive an hour out of town just to get to one. Instead, Tiff and I played Monopoly at her brother's place and she whipped my ass! It sucked losing, but it was great fun anyways.       Saturday (yesterday) there was a great big pit/bush party. I went out there with Tiff and Aimee. Tiff was the DD for the night, so Aimee and I got drunk. I met a guy there named Carter. He's from somewhere in British Columbia, but he was down here for some family reunion. He came to the party with a couple of his cousins, whom I practically grew up with when I used to live out on a farm. It was cool. And he's a great kisser. He asked me for my phone number, and I gave it to him, not actually expecting him to phone me, but, much to my surprise, I got a phone call this afternoon.       My God, the phone in this house was practically off the hook all day today. I was constantly getting phone calls from all of my friends. It was unbelievably crazy. My friend Ashton phoned me to see if I would go visit a friend with her. He used to live here and is back in town for a little while visiting his grandpa and aunt. I tell you though, I had the most boring time out there this afternoon. I was ready to gouge my eyes out for the least amount of amusement.      I got the day off from work at the clothing store, but I was supposed to work at the ice cream shop for the evening shift, but I got another girl to cover so I'd have one full day off of work. I don't have many of those, working three summer jobs and dealing with my alcoholic behavior (Just kidding!). No, I'm not an alcoholic. Borderline, perhaps, but not full blown.      I got home from visiting that old friend, was home long enough to watch two episodes of What I Like About You, and then I left again. I drove around for a little while, then ended up at O's place. I hung out with him tonight, and we rented a movie. Scary Movie 3. I've seen a couple times already, but Scary Movie movies are so unbelievably great; I could never get sick of any of them. When O and I went to the store to pick up the video, we ran into Carter and his cousins. Talk about awkward. It felt way weird, but kind of cool too. I burst out laughing and they all looked at me weird. Whatever though. I don't care.      Tomorrow, O and I are going to the lake. That is, if the weather is nice. We were supposed to go today, but the weather was totally shitty. Wasn't hot enough, is what O says. Big baby. Too picky. Carter and his cousins are supposed to be going out there too tomorrow. Maybe we'll run into them again and it'll be one majorly disturbing run-in. I can't wait for the awkward silence that awaits us.      Whatever happens, happen. Can't really do anything about it, now can I? But it does feel weird though. I still really like O, but there are so many other guys that, even though I'm not looking for a boyfriend right now, I would enjoy spending time with and possibly dating. Nothing serious. But... Fuck it. I don't know what I'm talking about. But, good news is... This guy named Josh, who is really cute and really cool, likes me and is coming to visit his grandma in a couple weeks. Yay. I hope we hang out.      Jesus Christ bananas! I sound like some love sick, boy crazy girl in the seventh grade. Fuck me Freddy! (I watched Dreamcatcher the other night, hence the new ""slang."" I definitely recommend watching that movie. Fucking great!) I'm really not a love sick, boy crazy girl in the seventh grade. I'm a grounded, mature teenager in the twelfth grade. I am smart and, depending on the activity, talented. I am not the kind of person to drop everthing for love. I will not, can not, and do not make my life revolve around love and sex. I am a rational person. I have my priorities straight. I know what I want out of life... What the fuck. Who am I trying to convince here; You? Or myself?      Anyways. I should run. Don't know why. I think maybe I'm just done writing stuff. G'nite all.      luv, nickie   xoxo"
5140,3936941,"25,July,2004",2004-07-25,"   Finally I got a look at  urlLink Whidbey Beta 1  and SQL Server 2005 Express Edition Beta 1 over the weekend.   So far I am really impressed with the new products. Even the Express Editions which are available for free while in beta have the most improved features built-in.  Cool things:    new keybindings (they definitely make more sense than the VS.NET 2002/2003 ones. If you don't like them, just change to the old ones)  Tracepoints (right-click -> Breakpoints -> insert Tracepoint): No more Trace.WriteLine when debugging. Extremely cool.  much improved intellisense. No more need for some addIns that ongoingly crash the IDE ...  Visual Studio settings can be exported to and imported from an xml file. No more redundant or registry based hacks when setting up more than one machine.  Many more settings available via the options dialog in the IDE  the MultiLine Property of the WinForms TextBox-Control is automatically set to true when you drag the textbox larger. Cool!    What sucks:    still no intellisense for sql.  Inconsistent Project defaults. SqlServerProjects put AssemblyInfo.cs in the root, not within Properties Directory (like winapps). I think this will be fixed.    GewÃ¶hnungsbedÃ¼rftig    Partial classes. Cool, but my first reaction was: Where is the damn code? (after adding controls to an asp.net page). Designer generated code goes to a hidden file. MVC!    I like it!  "
5141,3936941,"21,July,2004",2004-07-21,"   I relocated to Hamburg (largest city in the north of germany) at the beginning of july and on monday the world's largest cruise ship, the Queen Mary 2 from Cunard visited Hamburg for 24hrs. When the ship arrived, several thousand people were at the river Elbe at six o'clock in the morning to watch the ship enter the harbour. During the 24 hour stint almost 400.000 people came to Hamburg to watch the ship. The coolest thing was that it was extremely good wheather (sunny and hot). But after the ship had left, it started to rain almost instantly :-(  "
5142,3936941,"15,July,2004",2004-07-15,   Great BizTalk Blogger Martijn Hoogendoorn has published a  urlLink pipeline component wizard  and there is also the (really helpful)  urlLink Adapter wizard  from Scott Woodgates blog. Makes development for BizTalk 2k4 even more delightful.  
5143,3936941,"15,July,2004",2004-07-15,   Microsoft has published a PDF version of  urlLink Integration Patterns  from their Patterns and Practices Group.  Just gallopped through it but seems worth spending a weekend. Grab it!  
5144,3936941,"15,July,2004",2004-07-15,"   I participated in the Microsoft EMEA Security Contest 2004 and made it all the way to the finals in Amsterdam. Eight people (out of several thousand who participated in the Microsoft Security initiative 2004 either by ordering the Microsoft Security DVD or participating in special user group tour events or Microsoft Tech Talks) were invited by Microsoft EMEA to an all expenses paid trip to Amsterdam, including tickets for Tech Ed EMEA 2004, for the Finals. One candidate from South Africa missed the event (visa problems I think) and the seven other candidates came from Ireland (1), Great Britain (2), Germany (2), Austria (1) and Portugal (1) participated in the final round.  The Final, a knock-out quizshow, was filmed in a small TV Studio in Amsterdam on June 28th (the day before the Tech ed began). I made it to the last round but fell against Eamon Oâ€™Tuathail (with a score of 4 points vs. 5 points). Unlucky, but it was really a great experience. You can watch the winner's bio at  urlLink here  and be sure not to miss the webcast (live stream with  urlLink 56k ,  urlLink 100k  or  urlLink 300k  WMV format). It is definitely fun watching.  The whole final was done in english and we did not see the questions as in the video.  "
5145,3936941,"15,July,2004",2004-07-15,"   A few days ago I watched the Blue Man Group live at Berlin, Germany, where they perform ""The Complex"". I knew only little about the group (almost everything from the intel pentium commercials) and hence I did not know what to expect from the show. But it was extremely cool. The show is a ingenious combination of rock music, light show, very funny and sudden actions which also includes a wobble pudding. The show is definitely worth every penny.  "

Nerver used the software before, but it really seems to be pretty easy developing software things like pipeline components or adapters.

The only things that really seems to suck is  Enterprise single sign-on , which seems to offer only command-line tools for configuration. Nice work, M$.

16895,3948533,"16,August,2004",2004-08-16,"   I read that a year ago was the big blackout of 2003.  I remember it well.  I was totally oblivious to it, as I had daycare children so the television news wasn't on and I had no idea  1/4 of the country was in the dark.  I'm in one of the areas that was dark...exactly  11 miles down the road was the cutoff.  While people 11 miles from me could not turn on lights, I was sitting in air conditioning watching movies and eating microwave popcorn.  Life's weird, isn't it?  And I know I should have felt bad, but I didn't.  I turned that AC to high and sat back and relaxed.  What would I have done if we lost our power for that long?  I would have lost a freezer full of food...deep freezer as well as the one in the fridge.  I would have gone kind of nuts not being able to shower.  Laundry would have piled up.  As long as I could flush the toilet and wash I'd be ok, but having no hot water would suck.  We are so dependent of electricity, right now I have on fans, television, the fridge and freezer of course, the computer, lights...I know that I am a huge energy hog.  But what should I do, turn off one 40 watt lamp or unplug the stereo...would that help?  I'm just thankful that I wasn't one of the ""blacked out"" people, that we kept our power, and hope to continue to do so.  I like candles for their smell...not as a light source.  "
16896,3948533,"14,August,2004",2004-08-14,"   I found something wonderful at the grocery store the other night....footlong hot dogs and buns!  All summer I had seen the hot dogs, but not the buns.  I asked at the store about the buns and they said the didn't have them.  I said, ""But you carry the foot long hot dogs!""  Then last week they had several packages of footlong buns hanging by the hot dog case....but no foot long hot dogs in sight.  It makes you wonder, doesn't it?  Who the hell is the Einstein ordering this stuff?  So, anyhow, I now have a package of 6 footlong Koegel's franks and a package of 6 foot long buns and I'm going to grill them today!  There isn't too many things more fun than a foot long hot dog fresh off a charcoal grill.  All you need is a squirt of ketchup (you may need mustard, however, I do not) and you have a whole meal.  If you have some potato chips, it's a bonus day!  Foot long hot dogs were a favorite of my kids.  We would always get them when we went camping, cooking them on a little grill over the fire.  They fall off sticks too easily, but on a grill right over the fire they have that same taste.  So, today I shall have my foot long hot dog.  And I shall be full!  "

Anyhow, I'm a fan of these rooms because quite frankly, outside of a couple I know well, I really don't care to be pals with teenagers or idiots.  Why is it that in every private chat, there has to be one dingleberry who insists on inviting in the very people you have left the regular chat over?  If I wanted to talk to these bozos, I'd stay in the regular AOL chatroom.  I want to avoid their stupidity, small mindedness, attention whoring, whatever...and BLAMMO there it is, in a room that was supposed to be ""secret"".  Now they know the link and we can never use that room for privacy again.  Nothing said in these private rooms is X rated, there is no cybering or anything, just talking to friends without the drama and idiocy of these teenagers and others with the IQ of dryer lint.  I don't hang around with people like that offline, why should I be subjected to their drooling rants online?  I got an AOL account to surf the web and chat with like minded folks....not Special Olympians.  And I am not dissing people with real mental defects.  I have a few online friends who are ""slow"" or even borderline mentally handicapped, but they don't annoy me.  The ones that annoy me are the ""HEY WASSUP?"" ""Any fine hoes in diz hizzhouse?""  ""What size bra do you wear?"" morons.  I am also so sick of the teenagers who think AOL is their domain.  Sorry, it's actually an adult forum.  Paid for by adults.

I love my boyfriend, but sharing a computer with someone, even someone that you love, is definitely an exercise in....oh, let's say an exercise in not smothing someone to death in their sleep with a pillow.  Point in case, I work at home, so I do try to get off the computer in the evening/night/weekend so that he can enjoy surfing, chatting, etc.  Instead he will spend most of his online time downloading something...music, a game, whatever.  Then we will be infected with five dozen different viruses and he'll deny downloading anything that might have caused it.  Unless the virus came from a government website, the local newspaper website, or an email from Betty Crocker, Nestle, or General Mills, I don't think it came from anything I've done.  Then later that night I may be fortunate enough to catch some friends online.  Someone might even start a little private chatroom that we all go to.  Now, if HE was online, and they invited him in, he wouldn't go.  But if I'm on and in there, he wants to read over my shoulder, comment, and if I go get drink or, god forbid, go to the bathroom he'll actually get on and start typing in the chatroom.  He did this last night, so I finally just signed off and let him on.  I don't know if he went back to that chatroom, I just covered up on the couch and went to sleep.  Now, I know he is going to read this get he'll probably get that all pouty voice and say ""I didn't mean to (insert whatever).""  And I know that.  I know that he doesn't sit in a chair next to me, groping me, pulling my hair, and making all types of sexual references and gestures on purpose.  He isn't trying to get my attention away from the screen when he pulls on my clothes, tickles me, or tries to pull my pants down.  (""I'm just kidding with you."")  I just wonder how he'd view my ""kidding"" if I anally assaulted him with a cucumber while he was downloading yet ANOTHER Psychopathic rap artist or ANOTHER video game ROM, or whatever.

The seedy underbelly of ""the moronic state of children today.""  And before you think ""Oh, all OLD people feel that way about kids."" let me just say NO.  Let me cite some examples.  Last fall/winter I had five kids in my daycare home.  Their ages were 9 8, 7, and two 5 year olds.  At first I was really excited, I foresaw aftersch0ol games of Boggle and Scrabble, Monopoly tournaments, reading, etc.  Boy was I in for a reality check.  None of them knew how to play one game.  Not one.  They didn't even grasp the game ""Concentration.""  You know, where you put cards face down, pick two randomly, and try to maych them.  I even had Pokemon Memory, same thing with Pokemon characters on cards, and not even the 9 year old could ""get it.""  What the FUCK is there to GET?  You turn over two cards, remember what is on them, and try to find two the same?  The front of the box says ""Ages 4 through 8.""  I guess I got spoiled because my own two children, now grown, were actually able to ""get"" games.  By the time they were 5, they were playing Skip Bo and Uno and Monopoly.  And not ""babified"" versions either.  My mom taught them cards, and she was not a merciful teacher.  You either learned it right or didn't play, period.  So I guess I just don't ""get"" how a kid who is going into middle school in a year and a half can't figure out how to play Pokemon Memory or Mickey Mouse Yahtzee.  They begged me to play Mouse Trap, remember that game?  You set up this elaborate mouse trap and try to catch you opponent's mice under the big net at the end?  I told them I wasn't going to sit there and do it all for them.  They all reassured me that they had played Mouse Trap on many occasions and knew how to do it.  Liars.  All the board games eventually went up on a really high shelf and I brought out the video games.  They really didn't ""get"" a lot of them either, but at least the bright lights and sounds shut them up for a while.  "

My goal at that time was to get the Hell out of that place.  I just wrote down that I wanted to be debt free.  I didn't want a confrontation.  Just roll over, take it up the poopoo shoot without Vaseline, and smile.  Be nice.  Try to help others.  Seems the more I do that stuff, the more Vaseline I need.  I just want someone to be kind to me.  To talk kindly, to put me first, to care what I think or feel or want.  Not ask me, and do whatever the hell they want anyway, but to actually take into account what I say, think, or feel and make it matter.  Most of the time I feel like the only thing that matters about me to anyone is what I can do for them.  Babysit for free or cheap.  ""Loan"" them money I know I'll never see again.  Pay their bills.  Be their cheerleader.  I'd like a cheerleader of my own, someone to really share things.  Someone to share the bad stuff, not just the good.  Someone who doubles the joy and halves the sorrow...gag, yeah.  You know, what you want and what you get aren't the same thing most of the time.  I guess, all in all, I just want to matter.  I want my existance to matter.  There was a man here in town that most everyone in town knew of.  He died.  Nobody went to his funeral.  Not one person.  Not ONE PERSON!!  I don't want that to be me.  "

11556,3958372,"24,July,2004",2004-07-24,"   When I think about this Air Supply song, I don't know what to surmise. Have I lost in love or am I lost in love? I would like to think both. I kind of feel both today. I'm someone who likes to live for the day. Do I want love to be suffering, as someone said to me today - love is suffering! No way, I want to live every day happily in love. But is it humanely possible when you are constantly pursued by lonliness. Life is a constant fight against loneliness, despair, negativisim especially when you are living in a small country like Singapore, far away from your own country, far away from the dynamism of Mumbai city, your own folks and your friends. Out there, when your love lets you down, at least you have your family and friends to fall back on. Here there's constant despair, and an urge to escape from this island of loveless life. Today is my wedding anniversary, one of the most dull and boring days of my life, hubby just gave his courtsy call to wish me in the morning from distant America, without any display of love or emotion. He expects me to feel on top of the world with that. I'm human after all, so how do you expect me to react? It felt like the longest day of my life, I surfed the net, read the news, tried to sleep in the afternoon, couldn't sleep plagued by persistent negative thinking, popped an anti-depression pill to deaden the anxiety in my brains, slept finally, still many hours to kill, went to the gym and exercised for an hour, came back, ordered a Pizza, had a shower, and then made myself a strong drink which I had with the Pizza, still a lot of time to go. I'll probably read a book putting on my radio softly, hopefully sleep would invade my senses and make me happy and reposeful. Tomorrow is another day, hopefully it'll begin and end happily. "
11557,3958372,"20,July,2004",2004-07-20,"   Gloomy weather in Singapore. Strangely it's a feeling-less day. Don't feel towards anything strongly. Early in the morning I got a rejection letter from the newspaper that I had&nbsp;applied for a reporter's job.&nbsp;That is, after doing considerably well in the written test. Well that's my destiny I guess. We Indians are pretty&nbsp;good at passing off our failures to destiny.&nbsp;It's time to seriously rethink what I want to do with my life. Be a writer! I think I can pass off reasonably well writing erotic novels and letters. I guess am pretty good at it because I write erotic letters everyday to my sweetheart. I have no qualms or inhibitions about describing every little intimate detail of&nbsp;lovemaking, our&nbsp;fantasies, being&nbsp;far apart from each other. Every morning I log on to&nbsp; write a letter to him.&nbsp;Today it took me a while to get over the rejection letter and write him a long loving email, as if things were normal. Well&nbsp;in the midst of despair, love is our only hope I guess. You have each others love&nbsp;to fall back on. Love can be life's greatest support. No more PMS blues, life is calm and tranquil again. Time to go and exercise in the gym. Need to get rid of all the bad energies. I want to be a loving, hopeful and optimistic person and pass all the positive energies&nbsp;to my loved ones.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "
11558,3958372,"18,July,2004",2004-07-18,"   I had a terrible start to the day. No one loves me,&nbsp;life on earth is full of sufferings!! Well am on a total pms mode today.&nbsp;I see bleakness everywhere. This is my perception of life life today. Who knows, things might change tomorrow, in this world of constant mood swings. I had a bad start to the day. Hubby calls me from America to voice his discontent over an email I sent him last night- a one liner of course ""Are there no phone services in America?"" He hadn't&nbsp;called us for a quite a while. Well I guess&nbsp;it was enough to elicit an immediate respone - an sms and a phone call in the wee hours of the morning. Of course he expects me to write nice loving emails to him everyday but he doesn't bother to do the same for me.&nbsp; But&nbsp;what did I really gain from it??? Nothing, but pain. So from today, I've decided not to be emotionally dependent on T. I'm not going to be bothered whether he writes to me or&nbsp;phones me&nbsp;or sms' me. I'm going to build an invisible wall where no man can penetrate and hurt me. That's&nbsp;one thing. One incident sparks off the other. I had called up&nbsp;my distant sweetheart hoping to hear some kind&nbsp;reassuring words and&nbsp;hoping to feel loved and wanted but only met up with his stony silence. Never show your vulnerability to someone who is in awe of you because half the time he might wonder who you&nbsp;really are!! Alas! I'm beginning to believe in that almost hackneyed cliched saying, ""when you laugh, you laugh with the world but when you cry, you cry alone."" I guess that's true.&nbsp; Believe me, you are better off&nbsp;not communicating&nbsp;your grief to anyone. It's&nbsp; better&nbsp;to drown &nbsp;your&nbsp;sorrows in alcohol, a book, a nice&nbsp;movie or music. At least they wouldn't let you down. Unleash your grief and disappointments in your diary and when things start looking up, start day dreaming. What would&nbsp;I do if I have some money? First of all, buy a Sony PD 170 camera, then buy a the latest Nikon SLR Digital camera, buy the most sophisticated&nbsp;laptop with video eidting package and then weave around an enchanting world of my own, just live for myself and my little beautiful daughter. Some amount of materialism is not bad&nbsp;I guess.&nbsp;It keeps you going in life. So who says, you need a&nbsp;hubby or a lover to be happy! Happiness is within yourself, it's important to love oneself first!!&nbsp; "

I often feel insecure about him and in a rage I end up doing all the wrong things, in my fits of jealousy and possessiveness. I want to be the centre of his universe and want to be the most important person in his life. But when you are married for several years, things change. You are expected to mellow down and become mature, have less expectations from your partner and give him space. I haven't been doing that. I don't think it's impossible to change. Can I resurrect my marriage? I think it's worth giving it a try. It's never to late to realize one's mistake and try to mend things. I regret all my silly mistakes and seriously want to undo all of them. Is there a way out? "

I put a lot of sunscreen on my shoulders too and I still got a really bad sunburn. It hurt really bad whenever I would touch it or lift my arms up. It was like that for about 2 days but then it turned into a dark tan. Now it is pealing. It looks really nasty! But we have been back from out of town for about 1 week now.

I will also be posting all of the great art work I make I will be getting a deviantart account so I can put everything in one place.   I guess that's it for now! I am sure I will be adding tons of content to the site once I remember what it is ;)

26800,3972276,"23,July,2004",2004-07-23,"   Okay, so I haven't posted in a few days. Well there's a good explanation for that, I haven't been home. Well now I am so I've decided to write a little something. Since most of my posts are about the Cardinals, I decided to keep that trend going. Unfortunitly the Cards lost tonight 7-2, snapping a 5 game win streak. They played the Giants and Barry Bonds basically won the game. I think it was 3-0 and Suppan was still on the mound. I can't remember, but I believe the Giants had runners on first and third with maybe 1 or 2 out. I forget the exact situation, but you get the idea. Bonds came up and LaRussa decided to spot pitches carefully, but not intentionally walk Bonds. Sure I'm mad he hit the home run, but I hate it so much when people intentionally walk Bonds. Just go after him and if you miss a spot or he gets a hit, deal with it, that's what he's paid to do. So anyway, Suppan threw a fastball that was supposed to be outside, but instead just stayed right over the middle of the plate. Bonds crushed the ball into the seats in right field and the Giants went up 6-0. Oh well, shit happens. We'll get 'em tomorrow night. Tomorrow I'm going to see the Lion King on Broadway in New York. Should be fun I suppose, however it's a bus trip and a 4 hour one at that. I took a bus trip to Canada awhile back and that was hell. The seats are so uncomfortable and it's so boring. I'll just have to bring 4 hours worth of good music to listen to. Anyway I have nothing else to write so I'm going to bid you farewell. I'll write another update on Sunday I suppose about the trip. Hopefully all goes well. Later. "
26801,3972276,"20,July,2004",2004-07-20,   I just looked at the Cardinals schedule in the month of July and realized they've only lost 2 games this month. Their record in July is 12-2. Isn't that awesome?? GO CARDS! 
26802,3972276,"19,July,2004",2004-07-19,"   What up yo? The Cardinals won again! 11-8. How deep is a team when So Taguchi comes up with a game tying home run off Farnsworth? Plus Pujols went 5-5 with 3 fucking home runs, which is SICK! Poor Cubbies. Now they're 10 games back in the division and have slipped into 3rd place behind the Reds. Honestly it's hard to say the Cards have won the division, because they haven't. There's so much baseball left it's insane, so I'm not counting any team out. However, that being said, it's all in the Cards hand's now. All they have to do is keep winning and they're set. I'm pretty excited about a postseason run. St. Louis hasn't been in the playoffs since 2001 when they lost in the NLDS to the Arizona Diamondbacks. As any baseball fan would know, Arizona was lead by Curt Schilling and Randy Johnson that year and went on to beat the Yankees to win the World Series in seven games. Yes, back then I was also a Yankees fan. I have nothing against the Yankees, I just hate Steinbrenner and don't agree with him just running out and buying every big name player. The Cardinals have tons of stars and you might think I'm a hypocrite because of that, but the Yankees payroll is $180 while the Cards only spend $80. It just isn't fun to root for a team that can buy whoever they need to win. When I was a fan back in '95 they were a team on the rise and much more of an underdog. But whatever. I'm a Cardinals fan for life. Seeing as I've been called a bandwagon fan on many occasions, you can quote me on saying I'll be a St. Louis Cardinals fan forever. What else is new? The WSOP (World Series of Poker) is on tonite. I love poker and I love watching it on ESPN. Poker isn't really a sport, it's more of a game like chess. Like any sport, it takes talent to play poker or chess. Sure much of the time in poker you rely on luck, but these guys take calculated risks for the most part. I personally think poker is great. Ok, I'm done for now. "
26803,3972276,"19,July,2004",2004-07-19,"   Well I'm in a fantastic mood so I've decided to make another entry into this here blog. The Cardinals won their 3rd game in a row beating the Cubs tonite 5-4. I really don't like the Cubs. I'm not a fan of Dusty Baker, Sammy Sosa, or Moises Alou so there really isn't much incentive to like them. Plus you have to factor in the fact that they're the Cards most hated rival, so yeah I don't like them much. The game looked awesome on paper and man did it deliever. Zambrano vs. Carpenter was an awesome pitching duel. Carpenter is like a younger Matt Morris. Before Morris had arm surgery, he threw in the mid 90s. Carpenter throws in the mid 90s now, plus he has a sick breaking ball. Morris now has to rely more on control and his curve. The Cards really got a good deal with Carpenter when they picked him up from the Jays. This kid is going to be awesome when you pair him with Marquis. However, Zambrano is a total asshole. I'll admit the guy has talent, but he's way too fucking emotional. He gets out of control. Seriously, what pitcher has the nerve to hit a batter and then talk shit to him when he hits a home run? Plus to add insult to injury, Zambrano hit Edmonds again in the 8th after he gave up the 2 run go ahead home run to Rolen, the previous batter. I was pissed. I love Edmonds and I would have just kicked Zambrano's ass, but being the class act that he is, Edmonds just walked it off. Props to Jimmy. Rolen, my fucking hero, won another game for the Cards by smashing a ball to get back the lead for good. Anyway, the Cardinals are now 9 games up on the Cubs after they gained a full game with the win tonite. I'm not worried about the Brewers or the Reds, who will be much more of a threat next year. Plus the Stros aren't bonding well and Williams was fired, so they're done. Well if the Cards beat the Cubs again tomorrow the season series is done and they'll have a 10 game lead for the division. I seriously have to question what the fuck the schedule man was smoking when he went to work this season. How can the Cubs and Cards be done playing each other in July? That's a travesty. Oh yeah, I watched RAW tonight. Sadly I'm still a wrestling fan as most people just abandoned the fad years ago. I don't know what it is, but for some reason I'm still a fan. Despite the fact the product is becoming increasingly shitty, I love Chris Benoit as champion and Chris Jericho is my hero, as my s/n would indicate. I got bored though and didn't watch the IC title match between Randy Orton and Edge. I hate Orton and Edge is a bad IC champ. Edge will retain, probably by a DQ with interference from Evolution. It's sad that I know that isn't it? Oh well. Anyway that's it for now. I don't even think anyone reads this shit so I don't feel like writing anymore. Later. "
26804,3972276,"19,July,2004",2004-07-19,"   Seeing as the summer has proved to be more boring than I could have imagined, I have decided to create this online blog to keep me from dying of boredom. I don't see any point in writing a blog, but since I have nothing else to do I figure it should eat up some time. Today is Monday. I recently bought NCAA Football 2005 for the Gamecube thinking it was going to be a great game. However, after playing the game for about 2 days I realized the game sucks. Honestly, I think watching a rock would be more fun than playing this game. As a big fan of the series I'm incredibly dissapointed. Fuck you EA Sports. Oh man, I've been watching ""I Love the 90s"" on VH1 all weekend. That shit is fucking hilarious! I watched the entire decade from 90 to 99. I never watched the 70s or 80s, but now I wish I had. That show is so great, I recommend that anyone who hasn't seen it should check it out ASAP. Just don't buy those dumbass ""I Love the 70s, 80s, or 90s"" CDs. If you really want the songs, just go on Kazaa or something. That's it for now. I'm surprised I wrote that much. Go me. "
26363,3972921,"24,July,2004",2004-07-24,"   Now I don't think I have ever called him Chewy to his face. In fact I am not sure I remember how he got that name....something about back hair?  My friend Brian Jeanseau is the monthly Blog Star. I will be highlighting a new person in my life each month that inspires me, encourages me, or makes me laugh. This month's BS does all three.      Let's start with why Brian inspires me...  Brian is one of the most real people I have ever met. He is honest, forthright, and nice when doing it. Brian cares for his family. I think that is fantastic. He provides for his family, financially and I know he takes his wife on dates. I have observed him being an excellent husband and father.  Brian is encouraging. He recently took over as worship leader for our church and is doing a phenomenal job. I felt SO cared about the first week after worship he sent all of us an email informing us of how proud he was....so neat. He is always pushing me a little further than I want to go, and I truly feel he believes in me...I cannot say that about very many people.  Brian makes me laugh...mallard duck. Enough said.  I think Brian is one of the best people that I know and all of you should be lucky enough to have a friend like Brian.  Kat  "
26364,3972921,"18,July,2004",2004-07-18,"   I have become a member of the ""Check Fraudulence Club."" No I have not started conterfeiting checks in the McVicker's basement(next to the Meth Lab...AKA ""Brew Kitchen""). Yours truly had some checks that got into the hands of the devil's handy men(or women for that matter). Okay so I am kidding about the DH men...just need a little humor. I came home on Wednesday from a relaxing evening in the suburbs to find a letter from Winco Foods notifying me of a dishonored check. I thought that was weird since I have not shopped there in forever and I certainly did not spend $129. I mean come on...I don't think I have EVER spent that much on groceries..I am single...well maybe when I was a youth leader and all of those teenagers eating me out of house and home. Anyways I called the store and found out there was another check for $98...called the bank the next day to find out it is 6 checks thus far. Did I mention that this is on my closed account from WA? Yeah so I had to file a police report, they are sending me some stuff to sign, then as far as I know now I will have to take a police report to each place that this person wrote a check..needless to say I was hacked. I was more stressed than anything.  Tommorow I am teaching on Phil. 4:6-7  Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.  Kinda funny the scripture that I have been studying for the last week and a half is perfectly applicable to my present life circumstances.  I have spent the last couple of days realizing how truly blessed I am, which leads me to being thankful. I have had a really shitty last year, but despite the ebb and flow of life I realize I always come out of it fine. I survive.   The God that is my very breathe, my very reason for living, is my strength. Father I thank thee.   I am thankful for relationships, love, truth. Father I thank thee.   Take time this week to be thankful for your existence, purpose, and His divine beauty shining on you.  Kat  "
26365,3972921,"18,July,2004",2004-07-18,"   I watched the movie Grand Canyon last Sunday. I had not seen that movie in several years and was surprise by the poignant theme. I came away from that movie thinking/rethinking a lot of stuff in my own life as to how I am living and how that may/may not affect my world, my community.   Fast forward to Friday I am driving to work and I take a different route one that included me stopping by the yuppie Safeway(have you seen the ones with track lighting in the cheese/wine section?) for an energy bar before work. I decided to go up Cornell to 158th and drove by the large building I drive by on the 26 occasionally. I always looked closely at this building wondering what it was. They were obviously doing some sort of additions and thought it was perhaps a new college building or perhaps a high school, or a home for corporate offices of some sort. To my amazement it was a church. I saw the sign for a presbyterian church and was speechless. Now what I am about to write may seem judgemental...but I need to pose the question...why? I don't get it. I don't. Multi-million dollar(guessing...not really sure of the exact numbers) building projects when there are people with no food or clothes for people in the community. I just don't get the world today. I don't understand how we have a society in which the rich become richer and the poor become poorer. I was angry when I saw that it was a church. I am not trying to be a bleeding heart liberal but I feel something is severely wrong with this picture.   I was reading Blue like Jazz by Donald Miller again this week and he writes about problems. He states that the problem does not lie in the politics of the world, the church, but essentially the problem lies within us. He states that the only true change, true life-giving, God-honoring change would have to start with the individual. I whole-heartedly agree. It does begin with me.  When I have these moments of enlightenment I am jacked up and ready to make a change. I harbor these utopian ideas of evolving into a better person. I need to give more, consume less, live a life of simplicity. Give to the poor, I don't really need to buy make-up or shoes, I can give it away. I don't need to drive or buy products that are not good for the environment. I make list after list of all of the things I want to change about myself, my habits, only to be disappointed at my lack of discipline and follow-through. So I ask myself, how do I make changes in my life? Miller says that the path to joy winds through a dark valley of our own depravity.   I know that are times in my life when I have looked at my own crap and been so completely discouraged at my progress. I see who I am and all that I aspire to be and it makes me sad that I fall SO short of my expectations. The only thing redeemable thing about my life is the fact that as I may be overly critical of myself,God is not that way. In fact he is just proud of me that I get up and make the effort to live my life and want him to be apart of that. I think that things will really start to change not only in my own heart, but in the hearts of men and women in this world is when we see that we are a really screwed up people in need of someone to save us. Yes the problem is in me, but there is someone who wants to hold me, love me, and show me who I was intended to be without all of my self-absorption. In the light of that knowledge we CAN as Eugene Peterson says be made into our true selves, our child-of-God selves.  Peace   Kat  "
26366,3972921,"15,August,2004",2004-08-15,"   Each year as my birthday comes and goes, I take a significant amount of time reflecting on the past, present, and what is to come. Periodically a sense of nostalgia comes over me as I smell a familiar scent or hear a song that takes me to another place. These moments lead me to recall old memories, some joyous, others despairing. Recently I has one of these occasions as I began to read past journal entries.   Journaling for me has become one of my most treasured activities. It is a place that I bear my soul, process through emotions, and pray. Most of it is prayer. I write these letters to God of my pain, fraility, and my lack of understanding the mystery. I pour out my love, gratitude, and desire...passionate letter after passionate letter.  In these letters I record not only my own voice but the voice of the One who weeps with me, laughs with me, and renews hope within my feeble heart.   When I was in middle school I had a diary. I was good about writing in it. It always felt funny to write my thoughts, activities, and emotions to ""Diary"". It was pointless to me. I remember at slumber parties we used to read each others diaries if we were ""best friends""....only your BF could know the intimate details about you. I remember some of the things I used to read, "" We went to the mall today,"" or ""I really want a new phone,""...mine were always something about a boy. ""I really wish Josh McDonald would be my boyfriend."" Josh McDonald was my sixth grade crush who did not have a clue as to who I was until 7th grade when I became popular. Look back at those times, now at 26, I wish I would have kept those old pages. To be able to see the reality of middle school dating rearing it's ugly head again almost 15 years later would be humbling. Girls, I don't think we ever grow out of our girly middle school phase. We still ask each other info about what the boy said, we still get all stupid and googly, and we still think that the world would be complete if we just had ""the boy."" I'll try not to continue with this tangent and save it for the book. There is still something very sacred about the contents of a diary/journal that even only your closest friends are able to know your thoughts. Even with that said I only read exerpts from my journals to my most intimate friends...which consists of 2-3 people. And with that there is only one person who I would let hold the treasured contents and read it for themselves(you know who you are). It is a very very intimate thing.  Over almost 9 years I have written in everything from notebooks, cutesy journals from Old Navy, to napkins from coffee shops. I am somewhat of a minimalist so everything that is not being used is in the trash or on the way to the Goodwill...but never my old papers. There are moments, emotions, and journeys recorded in these books that would make an excellent made for T.V. movie. I read my earliest prayers and note that everything is flowery and pretty using big words like majesty, king of kings, and holy of holies. Over the years this was toned down as I grew in my relationship with God to words like my friend, my father, with the occasional king thrown in. Then there were the crying out for God years...that is where my pain began to seep into my view of God. My self-inflicted wounds causing me to to question whether or not he was there. My faith diminishing under the weight of disbelief, so I yelled, screamed, and cursed at God. He became at that point a comforter, lover, and a savior in a way I had not understood and still am trying to comprehend today.  Now I look back at my life over the last 10 years and I see that it is good. I struggle with my desire to be all that I aspire to be , yet all that He has created me to be...eventually I will grasp that these coincide. I see the person that I am becoming and it excites me. Not because of anything that I have achieved, but because I can see the miracle within me. I see the person I was, I am, and who I am becoming and I am awed by the work of his hand. Who ever thought he would take a snobby materialistic girl and change me into who I am being molded into?  I look over my relationships and am awed. I think back to years past and all of my friendships were somewhat superficial. This year brought some relationships to a close, but by the closing it brought a depth of love and understanding to some that lacked. It also brought the emotional availability to invest in new friendships. My friend Matt, who I would say is my best friend, has taught me new things that I never thought I could learn. We have fought over everything there is to fight over, disagreed on everything, and for a period of time could not stand each other. I have a greater understanding of fighting for people in relationships because he fought for me. He did not give up and now he is reaping the fruit of his hard labor...I am no longer a bitch(most of the time). I guess that is a miracle...he would say so. My friends Trissa, Julie, and Curtis have all had a hand in shaping me into the person that I am becoming. Entry after entry usually includes something that one of them has said to encourage, stimulate, or piss me off. It is so good.         These are pictures that were taken from my 26th birthday party. The picture with Trissa, Alicia, Matt and I, is my favorite. Allisha and Matt both helped out tons to get the party ready. They both know how stressed out I get at events that I am planning and so they were right there keeping me together. About an hour before the party Matt took over and finished getting things ready while I got dressed. Trissa and Jon arrived about a 1/2 hour later and Jon(who is not familiar with my pre-party stress) said, ""Someone get this girl a drink."" Trissa replied, ""This is just how she is before the party. As soon as people begin to arrive she will be a completely different person...laughing, enjoying herself."" She was right. It is so nice to have people in your life that know you so well. These relationships continue to go through trials and tribulations and each time we all learn a new meaning for words like love, forgiveness, understanding, and compassion. I am the person I am because of the people that play the part they are supposed to play in the symphony of life. Each instrument, each note being played, sometimes not harmonically, but after much practice and devotion...the music is played and flows into the beautiful melodies that are intimate relationships.   Peace  Kat  "

She fires a massive&nbsp;blast of magical energy.  High   Ordinators  (Goddess' Protectorate): ""U R TEH DED!~"" They charge in, slashing with their powerful&nbsp;magical blades.  Venicus : ""LOLz"" The blast of magical energy reflects off his spell-shield and back at Almalexia as he begins to cast a spell.  Almalexia : ""OMG! U R TEH SUX!"" She screams as she is hit by a massive explosion of every sort of damaging&nbsp;energy known to man.  High Ordinators : ""TIHS IS NOT TEH R0X0R!"" They are eviscerated by the blast of energy.  Venicus : ""HAHAHAHA I AM TEH R0X0R! UR TEH SUX0R"" He gloats.  Almalexia : ""OMG I GEV UP UR TEH MAST0R"" She kneels before Venicus and kisses his feet.  (This has been an extreme dramatization. They all died in a single casting of Venicus' Final Word spell, which deals one hundred points of Acid, Fire, Shock, Frost, and Health damage, each.)   So, yes, I have been having fun.

30498,3976084,"22,July,2004",2004-07-22,"   Hello, hello. This is being written from SUMMARR SKOOL. Yes, I'm in SUMMARR SKOOL, at this very moment. I just finished an assignment on Animal Interests. It wasn't in the least bit interesting, but it was informative. Very informative. I'm on the fence, in terms of animal rights. Cruelty directed at animals is wrong, yes. But we cannot reason with animals. In all this ""animal rights propaganda"", where are the lions chewing on the necks of people they have just slain? Where are the constrictors wrapped tightly around the bloated, bruised, and lifeless bodies of small children? You cannot stop animals from killing you for sustinance; so there is nothing wrong with utilizing animals for the same purpose, or for production purposes, so long as it is done in an ethical, painless way. In essence, animals have no rights, as they are&nbsp;incapable of comprehending&nbsp;their own existence, their impending death. They will kill, as every living thing is a murderer. Humans evolved the gift of production, and that is how we survive. Animals do not need to produce. So then why are their needs worth any more than ours? They aren't. We're all alive. We're all murderers. The best humans can hope to achieve is the painless processing of animals, not cruel in the slightest. Cruelty in one respect incites cruelty in others.  "

I'll be dropping out of school, to go on to community college, and then, probably, some university. Those who think people can't succeed without highschool are sorely misinformed. In fact, college is over-rated, as well. College provides an individual with steady income, yes, but some of&nbsp;those&nbsp;vocations tend to&nbsp;end in&nbsp;glass ceilings. You can only earn so much in a profession provided by college. One can only achieve so much without being an entrepenieur.

Well no one (except beth as of recent) comes in here anyways.. so what the hey.. Here are some things that have been on my mind...  For one thing.. is it ever going to stop raining?? I mean I saw what appeared to be construction of an ark in my neighbors yard.. not to mention I thought I heard some goats and horses. Last night my son came into my room swearing he saw a unicorn prancing around the backyard.  Why do we always look fat on video? They say the camera adds x amount of pounds..oook..why? Is it jealous of us for being in the limelight so its like.. *insert deep scary voice and cryptic music* mwuhahahaha NOW I take my revenge..* Why cant they make the food thats bad for you taste gross and the healthy stuff better? Am I the only one this seems backwards to? Last night, a man decided he wanted to be on&nbsp; my icq list and not knowing if it was the nickname of a friend that I didnt recognize...I went ahead and added him..we chatted briefly and I decided I wasnt comfortable with the conversation and frankly told him Im quite gunshy with the internet and dont volunteer personal information or anything of the like.. he was annoyed with my defensiveness and wanted to know why I had the internet.... wtf.. am I supposed to be content with him telling me hes not nuts to just take it at that..OOOO EVERYONE IM A %FT$ TALKING AND DANCING SQUIRREL!!CALL ME SANDY CHEEKS!!!!!!!! *dances around and shakes tail* PLUS, did I miss the memo that said computers were invented to go with a worldwide web solely created for chat with strangers to make the lives of psychos easier as they hunt their victims...

But I feel like something substantial is missing. My mind moves at 1000 miles per hour but lately its filled with trivial bullshit.. know what I mean?      For example...Ive seen my share of tv lately, and on vh1 I caught this show explaining meanings to songs...     Remember that song.. you oughta know..by alanis morisette? ya know the one! going down on whoever in the theatre and i hate to bug you in the middle of dinner.. and each time i run my nails down someone elses back I hope you feel it.. get it now? I think weve all smirked once or twice to that song.. right? Well theyre claiming that she wrote that song personally about an ex.. (you might have even seen this episode already..) they said its about Dave Coulier.. (Joey From Fullhouse) I was like !!!!!!!!!!!!!!I find this hysterically funny.. am I the only one? I mean COME ON.. snarly intimidating Alanis 'dont fuck with me' Morisette... goin down on Joey in a movie theater?&nbsp; Was he laughing like Popeye while she tickled his nuts???&nbsp; I mean thats like picturing my rockstar brother hooking up with that black lady with the shower curtain on her head that does the commercials for Honey Bunches Of Oats!&nbsp; Funny shit..

1460,3983686,"15,August,2004",2004-08-15,"   Well howdy all... been awhile since I rambled.. the quiz was a major flop it seems.. sorry to take up good blog space.. maybe I can come up with something more appealing to any of my loyal bloggers...but not tonight... tonight is a night for sad dribble..  Im sure most of you all know that my brothers band, seventh hour, has decided to call it quits.. and its just symbolic to me.. When this band started WAY back when they were Allstar it was such a new thing to me for so many reasons.. its was a time of my life when so many things were changing.. it was a like a door was being blown open.. for those of you that know me well Im sure you remember. Anyway it was totally exciting and I wanted to be a part of it in any way I could and I was really thrilled when I got to ""come along for the ride"". I was living with my brother at the time, who was also managing them, and they were practicing in his basement, and it was there that not only did I start many long lasting and cherished friendships, but I met my husband. We became fast friends and got to know each other through being a part of the Allstar experience.. him being a drummer for Searching For Gladys at the time, and had some great laughs and great shows til we finally got around to dating and the rest is history.. we're married with kids and tried to make as many shows as we could.. and usually were put out when we did miss something! I feel as though this band is a part of me cause it represents something so personal that I cant even begin to describe.. and now another time in my life has come where things are doing that blow the door off the hinges thing  again.. but it just isnt in a positive sense.. (one of the biggest things is losing my mother in September) and now seventh hour is coming to a close too. It all ties in together, see? Like life is a big roller coaster.  I could go into more detail cause its not just a chic whining about a band breaking up. Im not a groupie.. its FAMILY.  Look at it this way.. where else can I go to see all these same faces in the same place at the same time.. not to mention their originals are honest to God favorites of mine.. and Im not being partial cause of my brother..  To everyone in and a part of Seventh Hour and even the days of Allstar.. thank you for the memories.. they will be cherished and the days will be missed.. love yas!   "

10687,3984458,"20,July,2004",2004-07-20,"   When have mass extinctions occurred, and what kinds of ecological damage resulted?   &nbsp;  Life has been around since the Archean Eon (3.9-2.5byr) when the Earthâ€™s oceans and atmosphere formed. Since then, after life exploded in the Cambrian period, it has been battling the odds to survive. In every major era,     the Paleozoic   ,    the Mesozoic    and the Cenozoic, life has been threatened to die out, but has prevailed. There have been five mass extinctions palaeontologists have come to agree on, where large proportions of earthly life have died out. These are the:  &nbsp;  End Cretaceous Extinction (About 65 million years ago)  The most famous extinction, it destroyed 85% of all species, but was by far not the largest. Interest in this extinction stems from the cause. In 1980, Luis Alvarez controversially suggested a new theory that an asteroid impact could be responsible for the death of the dinosaurs, capturing the interest of the globe. This is the most probable explanation, although there are others. Dinosaurs were among the reptilian species largely affected, but by no means the only group. However, some groups seem to have avoided being scathed by this impact; birds, crocodiles and of course mammals all survived which lead to our own evolution.  &nbsp;  Late Triassic Extinction (About 208 million years ago)  One of the more overlooked extinctions, however one quarter of all life was wiped out, making it comparable to the End Cretaceous extinction. It is still unclear whether this event was two extinctions spaced 12-17myr apart, or a single event. Many species families were lost, and both Conodonts and Labryinthodonts were disappeared, making room for dinosaurs to take over. This was caused by global warming.  &nbsp;  End Permian Extinction (About 245 million years ago),  This was the most devastating extinction ever in the planets history, wiping out 96% of all marine species, while on land three quarters of all vertebrate families became extinct. In fact, for a time it caused fungal species to be the dominant form of terrestrial life. This also did away with the last of the surviving trilobite species. Fluctuations in sea level, differences in ocean salinity or volcanic activity may be the cause for this mass extinction, as always leading to climate change, in this case a global warming.  &nbsp;  Late Devonian Extinction (About 360 million years ago)  Major facts of this extinction still have not been agreed upon; however most information suggests this extinction/series of extinctions took place over about 3 million years. It caused huge damage to biodiversity and killed up to 70% of all species. Marine life suffered most, while freshwater species, land plants and early amphibians did not suffer as badly. The causes for this extinction are not apparent, but are probably due to global cooling as a disproportionate number of warm water species died.  &nbsp;  Late Ordovician Extinction (About 438 million years ago)  The Ordovician period was a relatively stable one, where substantial growth in biodiversity took place. However as the period drew to a close an extinction event occurred, causing some animal groups to loose more than half their species. It seemed to be caused by an ice age, lowering sea levels.   urlLink  Echinoderms   ,   urlLink  trilobites   ,   urlLink  nautioids    and other groups suffered heavily. However, overall the effects were not as great as other extinctions.  &nbsp;  Late Cambrian Extinction (About 500 million years ago)  This period was one of great evolutionary expansion, it appeared that life had taken hold and was in a great experimental phase, where many species were created leading to the main branches in design of animal and plant life from 570-500myr. Most of the animals at this time were soft-bodied creatures, leaving little fossilized records. Therefore the effects of this extinction are not as clear as they normally are. The causes or cause of this extinction are not well known, but there certainly were huge changes in sea level during this time. The trilobites suffered, previously being widespread and dominant. From here their species declined from successive extinctions.  &nbsp;  How do mass extinctions occur, and do their causes still pose a threat?  All the mass extinctions occurred from ever present natural reasons. The next one may be man made and unlikely to ever occur again after our extinction, e.g. a nuclear winter; however the catalysts for previous extinctions are still around. Although it is hard to say, due to incomplete fossil records and accuracy limits on dating, it appears there is a cycle to mass extinctions of 26-30 million years. This has tremendous implications, for it suggests a single cause for extinction. However, there is always going to be more than one cause for mass extinction. In fact there are far too many right now than for me to list. So the following are likely, major causes for extinction that have occurred or may occur in the future. N.B. God, divine, human, extraterrestrial and supernatural causes have been omitted because their categories are too open.  &nbsp;  Biological Collapse  Plants and animals all consume resources, converting them into un-recyclable waste. This can lead to a shortage of resources causing mass extinctions. A plague of parasites/animals may also manage to quickly kill off major links in the food web and collapse it or modify the atmosphere. If it werenâ€™t for plant life, the Earthâ€™s atmosphere would easily have ended up like that of Venus, so life has massive effects on the entire planet.  &nbsp;  Climate Change  Induced by solar events, such as sun spots, large prominences and other changes in solar weather, our weather can change. Cloud formation is dependant to some degree on levels of cosmic radiation received, if this varies, more or less clouds may form lowering or raising the temperature respectively. Any temperature changes or instabilities in ocean currents can cause polar ice caps to enlarge or melt, changing sea levels by several meters. Volcanism is usually a catalyst for this behaviour, and releases many poisonous gases and ash clouds that can cover the planet. Natural cycles of ice ages and heat are shown to occur, so there is no reason why they will not continue to do so. In fact, we are due for a magnetic field flip that occurs regularly for unknown reasons.  &nbsp;  Cosmic Catastrophes  Black holes are unlikely to sneak up on us, but it isnâ€™t impossible that one of our neighbouring super-massive stars collapse and suck us in. Cosmic radiation appears to be a factor that has caused a few extinctions. As we regularly pass through the Milky Wayâ€™s spiral arms in the suns orbit around the galactic centre (over many thousands of years), Earth is bombarded by high levels of cosmic radiation from increased numbers of nearby supernovae. This can change the ionosphere dramatically and the radiation is lethal to life, a possible cause of the Permian extinction. Asteroid impact. This is blamed for the demise of the dinosaurs, a six mile long asteroid smacked into the Earth with the force of 100 million tonnes of TNT, making a dust cloud that covered the Earth for about six months blocking sunlight. This isnâ€™t as bad as the collision that hit the early Earth before life came to be, when we collided with an object the size of mars, sending ejected material into high orbit that soon collected and formed the moon. Planetary alignments are a remote cause for concern; however in 2025 all the planets bar Earth will align on one side of the solar system with earth on the other. The resulting gravitational imbalance could alter Earths orbit to more elliptical creating huge weather pattern changes, change the Sunâ€™s short term behaviour, or even nudge some asteroids out of the asteroid belt towards us.  &nbsp;  Death of Sun  As it goes through its main sequence, the sun gets 10% brighter every 10 million years. This will make the surface of the planet uninhabitable long before it expands into a red giant possibly swallowing the Earth, and at least baking it dry and airless. At this point in time Saturnâ€™s moon Titan will become like that of early Earthâ€™s for a period of 1myr, possibly sustaining human life while the only chance for survival, interstellar ark ships, are constructed that can make the journey over thousands of years to other star systems.  &nbsp;  Death of Universe  Ultimately we will all come to an end. The universe will accelerate out from our reach leaving galaxies trillions of light years apart, clusters of dead star cores and cold planets slowly being consumed by central black holes. Any surviving matter will one day sublime into energy as fundamental particles loose their power. The largest of the black holes will finally evaporate leaving an empty universe. Only intelligent life will be able to avoid this fate, but it requires millennia of technological development to create technology powerful enough to save and create life perpetually. Itâ€™s unlikely our species will stick around that long and do it.  &nbsp;  If any of these causes for mass extinction were to happen, would we be able to fend them off or escape?  The ability to fend off disaster is quite rare. However, it is possible for us to try and cool the atmosphere in the event of global warming by changing the air chemistry, reflecting sunlight with huge solar sails and deflect/destroy any incoming asteroids. Unfortunately due to current financial and political situations, in practice such attempts would not work at present. The nuclear warheads would take months to prepare and launch, and we have a record of finding high risk asteroids after theyâ€™ve passed close to the Earth. Early warning detection and defence systems would cost billions of dollars, and were more likely do die of climate change anyway, like increased volcanism. Manufacturing volumes of gasses and huge high-tech reflectors would cost much more, and deployment is more likely to become a tangled disaster than a micro thin reflective success. Practically, it is extremely hard to prevent the causes of extinction, if not impossible. Try altering the sunâ€™s orbit or stop a supernova for instance. Escape is the best and frequently sole option. Escaping our entire solar system has already been achieved by numerous probes like Pioneer 10 &amp; 11 and Voyager 1 &amp; 2. Developing the plumbing to keep messy humans alive for long durations seems to be our only obstacle to following them.  &nbsp;  Should we fear the causes for mass extinction? By when will we have the technology to become invulnerable to mass extinction, if ever?  According to the cycle theory mentioned in Q2, we are in the middle of the cycle, about 10 million years out. This doesnâ€™t mean we are safe, it means it would be statistically surprising if we suddenly died out without having a fair share of time to live. And surprises happen all the time. It may occur to you that the Earthâ€™s biosphere has never been completely erased; our extinction may make way for the next kind of life. However, it is prudent to note that during the three to four billion year evolution of life, only once has it produced intelligence. This intelligence is a pretty fair shot, not just because it is naturally capable of constructing the environment, space travel, etc. but can engineer its own DNA intuitively which is the next evolutionary step. Direction. It is unlikely to ever happen again. Itâ€™s safe to say that it wonâ€™t happen again, we appear to have arrived just in the nick of time, as the Earth will loose its capacity for biological regeneration in less than a 100myr thanks to our warming sun. So the engineering ability is important. It will be the final step we take before our demise as humanity is superseded by what we create. Obviously weâ€™ll borrow from the finest evolution in nature to perfect this new machine, which will still be representative of ourselves. But it will be far more efficient, hard and adaptable, opening up the majority of planets for habitation instead of the incredibly few Earth-like ones we may never be able to reach or find. They will take their like wise engineered flora and fauna extending the biosphere of Earth because they can do what we fall short of, evolution will not take us outside the box because weâ€™re adapted to live and inflexible. And they will point up at the stars speaking of the yellow sun and the blue planet, and say it all started there. That is the point when we will have the technology to become as invulnerable as possible to mass extinction, spread right across our galaxy. The technology for this will be perfected within the next five hundred years. Just a bit more know how about genetic engineering, and the materials and habitat sustaining technology to build a ship with an ecosystem that can support generations of people for a few thousand years without breaking down. As for cheating the death of the universe, the technology it currently a theoretical impossibility. Fearing the causes of mass extinction and building defences against it will probably only save us from mass loss of life, as total extinction is very unlikely. Especially since the resources to send a colony to live on Mars is already in place bar about 5 billion US dollars, making us invulnerable to total Earthly catastrophe. Even if an asteroid hit, a few of us will survive, whether it is by keeping a fire alight in the darkness and eating dead animals, or in a nuclear bunker for 6 months. In short the answer is not to fear, but work as quickly as possible towards creating the pinnacle of evolution and finding new homes.  "
23158,3990427,"30,July,2004",2004-07-30,"   Last night was...interesting? I got roped into going our with Rachel and Catherine to the bar at the Loews in Philly. The event was for The Young Professionals&nbsp;of Philadelphia. Yawn. The bar was gorgeous but the people were less than impressive. Tons of Real Estate folks and reps. from the City Paper. (Trash paper, as I like to call it. Serious. Naughty personal adds and all.) We mill around smoking cigarettes, I drank perrier with lime, the gals had vodka martinis. I'm watching my calorie intake and this was NOT the occasion to break it. I'm not tricking myself into feeling comfortable around these lame-ass dudes by ruining my diet just so I can hold a glass of alcohol and sip it all night.  We pretty much stayed around the people we knew. No schmoozing. Just making fun of the insipid crowd and the old fellah in the FULL, top and bottom, bubblegum colored suit.  We stayed for about an hour (which felt like 5) and moved it on over to the U Penn campus for movie night on the lawn. We saw a HORRIBLE serial called Mystery Mountain about a guy named Ken and his nemesis The Rattler... I joke you not. It was not even kitchy. Just plain horrible. They really neede the guy who did the sound for The Stooges. Their fight scenes packed no punch. (heh heh heh) The main show was a movie called ""Youth Gone Wild"". The ebtire show we were waiting for someone to go wild - we were left unsatisfied. It WAS totally a ball though. We played Mystery Science Theater 3000 the whole time and poked fun at the film.&nbsp; I think my favorite part was when Tottie ( the dame of the flick) DIED by getting hit across the face with some guys legs, mid air, as he was being flipped over someone else's back.&nbsp; Did you get that?? THAT""S NOT POSSIBLE!!! There was even a dramatic scene of a priest reading the last rites...what a RIOT! Thanks for the memories ""Youth Gone Wild"".   "

23020,3990866,"06,August,2004",2004-08-06,"   I'm slowly working my way through the site. Fundraising section is under the scalpel at the moment and has been reorganized. I'll be adding a new page for just campaign details to update the content and feel. Once that's done, I'm going to move over the PLU job and get that done, bringing in the new template to get it flowing with the rest of the site.  Other than that, CSS is becoming unmanageable on the site. Don't understand why it wouldn't style those classes today. *Sigh*. Plan is to finish an initial sweep to the 1.1 template and then stop completely on any further rework. Sit back, read, study, and do a proper design for the site as an on-going project. Then start on the same initial 1.1 process for the Intranet. Shouldn't take as much time as there is less content.  Note: Ask Annie about buying Sitepoint book. Come in early tomorrow and focus harder on work.  "
23021,3990866,"06,August,2004",2004-08-06,"   11:39am  Things going well. Index.html now redesigned and cleaned up to look like an introductory letter. It's now looking slick and easy to digest. Next to the about section and cleaning it up. All is well here so far.  18:19pm  Powerful day. About section now reorganized and all it needs now is just some final touchups and formatting. Will be done first thing Monday morning. Next after this, the rest of Annie's updates. Bit behind but I'm getting in some quality to the work. So I'm peaches and cream.  "
23022,3990866,"05,August,2004",2004-08-05,"   15:49pm  Finally. Completely done. The following were the objectives:  1. Indenting, organizing, and unifiying the markup                                                        -- DONE -- 2. Developing the commenting style to be used on ALL pages from now on             -- DONE -- 3. Breaking the template down into sections for code reuse                                           -- DONE -- 4. Optimizing the template and tweaking the tables without breaking the design    -- DONE --  Didn't blog yesterday as it was a slow and difficult day, and actually forgot to blog. I got so frustrated. Here's the scenario: I thought I finished the template. Off-line, it's beautiful. I upload it and update the stylesheets, and it breaks like a Ming vase. Couldn't figure it out and went home awfully frustrated.  Came in this morning and looked at it with a fresh pair eyes. Went back into the template and did further clean up. I had messed up the template before I left yesterday because I wanted to get all three main elements - the left hand navigation, content area, and right hand side boxes - to be on the same vertical height. So, I came in today and restored the template to health. Made a copy and worked on that copy until I did it. Golden rule:  Never touch a finished template. Always fine tune and hack a copy.  The template is now much cleaner, although still table-based. I must say though it's a weak-coupled table-based, as I have moved most of the styles and formatting to the CSS. Finally, the template actually looks virtually identical to the original Brookes one. So, I'm quite pleased, although my eyes are beyond exhausted.  And all this for the links page.. *sigh*. At least that page is now complete. Next up: the index page is getting a serious face lift. But since I have my trusty template, it's just about doing some re-organizing and cleaning up.  I'm taking a jazz break, resting my eyes, and doing some paper work. If I have time, I'll start coding up the new SHSC homepage!  "
23023,3990866,"03,August,2004",2004-08-03,"   10:21 am  After wasting so many hours yesterday trying to fix a broken table-based layout for the revamped links page, I've decided to stop a bit on the update work and construct a clean, readable template from one of the files of the SHSC website. It's just a waste trying to infuse new blood into a corpse held together by spit. Preliminary plan for this template sub-project:  1. Indenting, organizing, and unifiying the markup -- DONE -- 2. Developing the commenting style to be used on ALL pages from now on -- DONE -- 3. Breaking the template down into sections for code reuse 4. Optimizing the template and tweaking the tables without breaking the design -- IN PROGRESS --  After finalizing the template, it's cloning a new links page using the new template and uploading it.  17:17 pm  So close yet so far. Got to the bottom of the template file and the bottom td cells broke. *Sigh* Will hopefully iron out the spooks in the morning. But so far, have managed to get an empty area in the middle and keep everything standing. Have replaced all the spacer gifs and used simple styles. It's all in the padding, that's my advice to recovering table addicts. Even got around images and borders.  So close and will be there tomorrow morning.  "

20333,3992091,"21,July,2004",2004-07-21,    Ok this is my first post. Just testing and stuff. 
20334,3992091,"17,August,2004",2004-08-17,"    Look! Look!     Wow, don't they have lovely scarves. Wouldn't it be great if I could, say, knit one just like it?     Woohoo! It is so incredibly soft too, I love it!  I am a self-admitted dork but dorks are cool anyways. "
20335,3992091,"14,August,2004",2004-08-14,"    I finished a project! WOOOOOOHOOOO!  My Harry Potter scarf is now DONE. I just need to block it, which I will do when I get back home tomorrow.  I'm very happy about it and for the first time ever, I'm looking forward to the cold weather just so I can wear it. :p I will post pics in a couple of days.  ***  Now. I still have two WIPs, both of which I'm a bit bored with. I'm working on my illusion scarf right now (I have a bit more than a third of it done).  I will receive the Noro Kureyon beauties soon and they will be made into a bag.  But I also have one million projects in mind and I can't decide which one I want to make next. So here's me organizing my thoughts...  I have two knitted presents planned for the holidays.   Mom : I'm hesitating. I can go simple and knit her a scarf. Her coat is white and red. So the colours would have to go with it. I know she LOVES my HP scarf so I may go with a similar style (in the round and all). The other option would be the Chinese charm bag from Stitch N' Bitch. I already have the handles and she loved it when she saw the picture in the book. I just don't know which yarn I'd choose as I don't know where to find Noro Gemstones. If not, I guess I'll choose another brand of variegated yarn. I just need to be very careful with the colours to make sure she will actually use it.   Sister : My first idea was to make her a scarf and if I have time, mittens or a hat to go with it. The problem is that I have no idea what kind of coat she's gonna wear this winter. So I wouldn't know which colour to choose. Hmmm. Option #2 would be felted slippers, like the Fuzzy feet from Knitty. It's marked as a ""tangy"" pattern though. But it really is just a huge pair of socks and I've been meaning to try socks anyways. So I don't know.  I really need to figure out what I'm gonna make and start soon since I'm such a slow knitter.   Projects for me that I have in mind :  -A poncho AND/OR a shawl AND/OR a blanket. Basically, just something that I can bring at work to wrap myself in when I'm cold and everyone else is hot so I can't turn on the heat. I just need to find the perfect pattern first.  -A sweater. I want to make my first sweater and I want to make it now. :p I'm hesitating between To dye for, from the SNB book or the Surplice Cardigan from the Fall 04 issue of Vogue knitting. It's very pretty and marked as easy so maybe I could manage to make it.  -Socks. I really want to make socks. Any socks.   So many projects, so little time.  ***  Thing to add to the ""I want it but can't knit it yet"" list: Charlotte's Web. I wish. "
20336,3992091,"12,August,2004",2004-08-12,    Lookie what I got on Ebay.... Three skeins of this:     This is so gonna be a bag. 
20337,3992091,"11,August,2004",2004-08-11,"    I just won 26 pairs of knitting needles on Ebay.  *happy dance*  Now I still need a set of Denises. BUT, I'm using those as an incentive to stick to my diet (I'll buy them when I've stuck to my diet for a certain number of days OR when I'm to a certain weight that I'm not disclosing here).  Oh and FYI: I'm hoping for a FO sometime next weekend. Weee! I'm such a slow knitter... "
20338,3992091,"07,August,2004",2004-08-07,"    I went to my LYS today. Now the place is small. Tiny. But so filled with yarn. I love it. And the place was crowded today (mostly older ladies). I spent so much time there, just looking at all the yarn, touching, trying to decide what to buy. I really just wanted to see if they had more of the yarn I'm using for my HP scarf (they did!).  It was so funny too, there was this lady there who had the most charming accent (she said she's originaly from Egypt but she's been living here for 20+ years). She was talking to this other lady, telling her that she would once again get out of the store with too much yarn and a big dent in her bank account. ""There's just so many nice things in here!"", she said and then she looked at me and smiled and said ""don't you think?"". I just smiled and nodded. I looked at her shopping basket: it was FULL! I swear she must have had over 200$ worth of yarn in there (and the yarn is quite cheap there so that's a lot of yarn).  I wish I could have bought as much but my wallet said no. I bought one ball of yellow merino wool and two of the red one (I'm hoping I'll have leftovers to make mittens or something). I also bought some type of novelty yarn (similar to the fun fur thing) in two different shades of purple. There was a scarf made with that yarn in the store that was just too cute.  And now is the time for a little confession. My name is Caroline and I'm a scarf addict. I know I should knit other things (and I will, my next project will be a sweater, I'm pretty sure) but I think I will ALWAYS have a scarf on the needles, whether it's for me or a gift. The thing is, I've loved scarves even before I started knitting. I always buy too many of them in winter. I have three black coats (different styles, same colour) and I like to change the look with a different scarf. What can I say. So yeah. Scarves. My HP one is looking good even though I still have eight (?? I think) stripes to knit. Wanna see? I know you do!    It's all soft and warm too! Woo! "
20339,3992091,"06,August,2004",2004-08-06,"    Once upon a time (i.e. a few years ago), there was this girl -- we'll call her Caroline -- who wanted to learn how to knit. Why? This will remain a mystery, even to her. Caroline's mom knows everything, or so the knitter-to-be thought. ""Mama, can you teach me how to knit?"", she asked (except what she really said was ""Maman, peux-tu m'apprendres Ã  tricoter?""... Yes, Caroline speaks a weird and mysterious language sometimes known as Canadian French).  Much to her surprise, the mother replied that she didn't know how to knit. Crushed, Caroline put away all of her knitting dreams, convinced she would never learn the craft.  Now fast-forward a couple of years. We are now in December 2003. Caroline has a two weeks holiday break from work. Joy! Happiness! Boredom! Inspired, she suddenly decides that she would learn how to knit and that in fact, she would learn how to knit right at this moment. So off to Wallmart she goes. There, she finds a little ""I taught myself how to knit"" kit (as well as a ""I taught myself how to crochet"" one that has yet to be used). She also buys some yarn that fitted all the qualities she thought were needed in a yarn (i.e. the colours were pretty). So Caroline gets home, she sits comfortably on the couch, book in hand. She learns how to cast-on and then how to do the knit stitch. ""Woohoo! I can knit!"", she proudly thought.  Caroline puts the book down and decide to begin the obligatory first scarf project. Unfortunately, things don't go too well and what was supposed to be a long pretty scarf quickly becomes a sort of weirdly shaped piece of fabric. So our hero puts down the needles and doesn't touch them for a couple of months.  Then, in February or so, she picks them back up and start a brand new scarf with brand new yarn. This time, she decides to count the stitches on every row. After what seems like an eternity (it was really three months), she has her first -- still uneven but much better looking -- scarf (see Figure 1).     Figure 1. Caroline's first scarf   What I haven't mentionned yet is that while she was working on that scarf, Caroline had heard of a knitting book called Stitch N' Bitch that seemed to be all the rage. Of course, curiosity got to her and she ended up buying the book. She fell in love with many of the patterns and the love affair still continues today.  But back to the knitting projects. After the scarf, Caroline decides she wants a bag. So why not try one that's in the beloved book? And with that, she starts her second knitting project: Zeeby's bag. It takes a month to finish and ends up not looking exactly like the original, but she likes it nonetheless and still uses it often (see Figure 2 and 3.)     Figure 2. Zeeby is resting on Caroline's lay-z boy.    Figure 3. Caroline is pretending to carry Zeeby for the photographer**.   Since then, Caroline hasn't stopped knitting but for some unknown reason, she can't seem to finish anything. She currently has three projects on the needles (two of them are almost done now) and she can't wait to show them off.  She also has an insanely long list of ""To-Knit"" items...  **There was no photographer, I made that up. "

I  saw a Brett at a rest stop  on the way home.  Nearly shat myself. I hate Bretts. I asked for some of his refreshing beverage to wash down my tasty burger, but he told me to go fuck myself. So I said, ""Brett, you are most definitely NOT a smart motherfucker,"" and proceeded to bust at least 10 caps in his sorry white ass.  Anyways, i'm sitting at my computer, currently listening to ""A Day in the Life"" by the Beatles. Its trippy. And i'm also talking to alissa. she said she'll be right back. She's back now. So anyways, David, get your sorry as down here. I need a drinkin buddy.  And someone to pick up chicks with. Wait a minute, what chicks??? There's chicks in Canada? Sheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeit. Now i'm listening to some floyd. Young Lust. Ooooooooooooooooo..........I need a dirty woman.  I really do. Like, fuck man. Its raining cats and dogs outside. Where the hell did that expression come from? I mean, what the hell. Raining cats and dogs??? Why the hell not sheep and llamas. This calls for some affirmative action.  I mean, if several Mexican Whooping Llamas can't get the same treatment as a couple of mangy cats and dogs, then what will become of the North American Spotted Llama!? Won't someone please think of the children. For the love of Jebus H. Christ. I believe the ""H"" stands for Harold. I'm no listening to Ode To Joy, I'll tell ya, the change in mood can almost kill a man. You wanna know why i'm listening to it? because i'm a cultured sunnofabitch, that's why. I sip whiskey, drive a bently, and hate network televison. Now there's some crazy latin shit in the song. Why? because latin's cultured. Yes yes...now i believe i'ma set as spell on the veranduh and have the slaves whip up some mint julips. What the hell is a mint julip? Is it like a tulip? except more ""j"" and less ""t""? Now back to some floyd. From the wall, guaranteed to pick your spirits up. Well, it beats peter frampton. i hate that man. yet i can't stop listening to show me the way. oh fuck, i need a drink. i'm gone          Will batman escape from catwomans claws? or will that feline feind's revenge be the cat's meow????

23441,3994011,"21,July,2004",2004-07-21,"   This week's survey:  In a completely unbiased survey this weekend, I asked my mom who the greatest person on Earth might be.  Imagine my suprise and humble acceptance when she told me that I was not only the greatest person on Earth, but also the smartest and most handsome.  She then had the audacity to ask the greatest person on Earth when she was going to get additional grandchildren.  ""Begone mortal!""  I answered and hung up the phone.  Be sure to check next week's results when I ask my cat, ""If my name is Meow, who is your God?"" -----------  A beautiful woman I was conversing with recently had the ""I can bring home the bacon, fry it up in a pan..."" song running through her head and asked, ""What was that advertising: cigarettes, bacon-flavored lube, what?""   My answer:  In early 1972, The grocery store chain, Piggly Wiggly produced a bacon-flavored lube named Slippery-Pig.  The earlier ""Pork-A-Lot"" name was abandoned when farmers came in looking for a place to store their pigs.  Anyway, it turns out that the stuff was not very slippery, it smelled more like perfume and their slogan - ""It's chock full of bacony goodness!"" - wasn't testing well with their target demographic, so they renamed it ""Enjolie"" and sold it as perfume.  Strangely enough, she seems to have found this story entertaining.  Maybe I had found the right woman after all these years of bad choices.

11623,3994464,"21,July,2004",2004-07-21,"   I asked my daughter today what her inner voice defines about her these days.&nbsp;&nbsp;   I wanted to hear her  very deep  inner voice-&nbsp; not the stuff like, ""a great vocalist,"" or ""good test-taker.""&nbsp; The deep inner voice that  defines her  is what I sought.&nbsp;   Mine is, right or wrong, ""special and different.""&nbsp;   It wasn't always that way.&nbsp; It used to be ""slutty and irresponsible.""&nbsp; Then it changed to ""overwhelmed martyr/screw-up-at-life.""&nbsp; Then, I turned 30 or so and it evolved to ""trying very hard.""&nbsp; In later years, it changed to ""successful at work but not quite there as a Mom.""&nbsp; And so on.&nbsp; I'm sure it will keep changin' as I go.   My daughter's inner voice, right now,&nbsp;is ""the Good Kid.""   I got to thinking about that.&nbsp; I asked her if she knew what happens to Good Kids.&nbsp; She replied, ""They die early?""&nbsp; I said, ""Well, sure.&nbsp; They get mauled by tigers.""&nbsp; (See, we share a morbid, sick sense of humor, we Wheatleys.)   ""Seriously, though,"" I said.&nbsp; ""'Good Kids nearly always have something in common:&nbsp; They have fantasies of being bad, and since they're good, they're really bad at being bad.""&nbsp;   I went on to describe it-&nbsp; we all have those friends who are just  not  good at cussing.&nbsp; They're also terrible and weepy when drunk.&nbsp; They ""get caught"" more than everyone else.&nbsp;   My goal as a parent is to try like hell to encourage them to figure out what they're thinking, feeling and living, such that they can be comfortable in happiness before they're parents themselves.&nbsp;   Yeah, I realize that things like hormones, lack of maturity, and lack of education prohibit some self-actualization, but I still GRANDLY envision my kids being simply and utterly as happy as is possible at this moment and every moment in the future.&nbsp;   And of course, true happiness is often borne through tribulation and mistake-making.&nbsp; So don't get me wrong and think I'm Alice in Wonderland-ish.&nbsp; 'Cause I'm more like the cynical Susan Sarandon in whatever that movie was where they flew off a cliff in a car.   But could it be that a person's label of Good Kid could hamper their ability to be bad, and therefore redeemed, and therefore, happy?   I dunno-&nbsp; it's just what I've been thinking about while reading  The Ragamuffin Gospel-- &nbsp; Manning's description of the Catholic definition(s) of sin- mortal and venial--While he draws a hilarious picture of his experience in confessing&nbsp;adolescent masturbation&nbsp;with his priest, the shame he also endured was palpably recognizable to me.&nbsp;   He's making it painstakingly clear that Christ apparently preferred sinners to&nbsp;Good Kids.&nbsp; He said he came for the sinners.&nbsp; He let the Good Kids do their thing.&nbsp; (When I say Kids, note I don't mean the little children who He obviously loved dearly.) The Good Kids were apparently ""Pharisees"" back then.&nbsp;   I donna wanna mi' daughter to be a Pharisee.&nbsp; Yuck.   So anyway, if it's true that he loved the sinners, then the question I have is whether to encourage my daugther to just  be .&nbsp; Not be the Good Kid.&nbsp; To just be.&nbsp;   And perhaps screw up every once in a while so she can learn how freakin' awesome it is to be unconditionally forgiven simply because Jesus loves her.&nbsp; Nothing she can do can make that bigger, better or different.&nbsp; It simply is what it is.   Hmm.&nbsp;   "
11624,3994464,"21,July,2004",2004-07-21,"   I just fell in love with Brennan Manning, author of  The Ragamuffin Gospel  and  Ruthless Trust .&nbsp; His followers were mine as a younger ""christian,""&nbsp; Michael W. Smith as a teen, and more importantly, Rich Mullins as an adult.&nbsp;   Rich came to San Antonio frequently when I was doing the Baptist thing.&nbsp; I'll never forget one night when he played and my mom and I were there.&nbsp; It had to be at least ten years ago, and I honestly have no idea why only Mom and I ended up at this event.   It was her birthday.   I watched and somehow decided that in heaven, I'd be married to someone like Rich, because he GOT it.&nbsp; He understood the way that Christ was about.&nbsp; And he'd be a good husband.&nbsp; I literally coveted Rich Mullins' existence.&nbsp; (though I was married with three kids at the time and didn't have his existence.)   Ok, so of course, there's some weirdness about that.&nbsp; But I really lusted after Rich in the most spiritual of ways.&nbsp; I just wanted him to be my husband and then everything would be okay.&nbsp; (Mom, at that time, wanted me to marry Carmen, but that's another blog.)   So later, I&nbsp;used my ""Christian connections"" and got us into the Christian bookstore ""afterparty"" and he came in and as he was exiting after a ten minute acoustic thing, and we passed him on the stairs.&nbsp; I screamed to him like I was a groupie and he was a Beatle, ""RICH!!&nbsp; IT'S MY MOM'S BIRTHDAY!""   He stopped and looked at me.&nbsp; I grinned charmingly and said, ""Pretty please, could you sing her Happy Birthday???""   He looked at me (and with what&nbsp;I hope&nbsp;was wishfulness that I was his wife,)&nbsp; sang it.&nbsp; Sweetly and with authenticity.&nbsp;   And my mother was as thrilled as all get-out.&nbsp; And I always loved him more for that.   When I learned he died in a car accident, I just ached.&nbsp; I even committed the mortal sin and actually ""prayed"" to Rich on a regular basis when I was confused or lonely.   So fast-forward to today:&nbsp; I'm at  Barnes and Noble  picking up Brennan Manning's  Ruthless Trust  and was inadvertently directed by the store clerk to  The Ragamuffin Gospel .&nbsp;   And lo and behold, there was a message in the forward by Rich,   And lo and behold, DUH, this is why he's called his band  The Ragamuffin Band .&nbsp;   Good lord.&nbsp; Could it be I'm finding what I was looking for?&nbsp; Even if it's  not  being married to Rich?   I'm overwhelmed.&nbsp; Because guess what?&nbsp; Today is July 26.&nbsp; My Mom's birthday.&nbsp;   No joke.   "

C'mon, admit it-&nbsp; church sucks.&nbsp;   For me, at least, church is something my parents instilled by forcing me to go.&nbsp;   But I've still&nbsp;tried nearly all of them:&nbsp;   1)&nbsp; I've tried the  traditional  ones that have large, inspirational architecture and intellectually interesting rituals.&nbsp;   And wow.&nbsp; All of that inspired me.&nbsp; I had the most amazing experience in St. Patrick's cathedral once with my best friend.&nbsp; I remember leaving and feeling that it was almost like a (really good) sexual encounter.&nbsp; The vastness of the building, combined with the hushed reverence that it commanded, caused this wonderful discussion of Mary Magdelene's role as a female disciple, and I felt awe and power while we quietly worked through a few personal issues.&nbsp;   But I know I wouldn't awaken each Sunday and feel compelled to visit St. Patrick's.&nbsp; Quite the contrary; I want to reserve it for a few special times.&nbsp; It's too freakin' awesome to become that familiar to me.   2)&nbsp; I grew up in the beautiful, homey,  community  churches.&nbsp; They're everywhere, and their allure is never really denominational, truth be told.&nbsp;   Instead, the claim to fame in these churches is that they love kids.&nbsp; They nurture families and provided a place for us back when we were kids, and now, as we have become parents, they have a neat Sunday School program which prepares the kids for school and also re-instills our generational values.&nbsp;   The great thing about community churches is that you can raise several generations of children with the same old folks, thus creating a sense of family.&nbsp; Unfortunately, in every ""family,"" Grandpa thinks his way is right, and that it transcends ANY modernity.&nbsp; So, Mom and Dad listen to Grandpa.&nbsp; And kids rebel against that, and come back into the fold after law school or having children themselves.&nbsp; It's inbreeding at its worst, but it serves to educate us&nbsp;on all that modern politics is&nbsp;about, eh?&nbsp;   Oh, and ""church splits"" in community churches are the bloodiest.&nbsp;   And many people&nbsp;just eventually wake up one Sunday morning and decide that  Meet the Press  and the  New York Times  are more interesting and less painful for both themselves&nbsp;and their kids.&nbsp;   3)&nbsp; I love the  fun  churches.&nbsp; These are the ones with charismatic pastors who garner a national television audience.&nbsp; The music rocks, the building is usually donated by a local millionaire (who controls the church council, incidentally) and their Easter and Christmas Eve candlelight services are standing-room-only.&nbsp; I'm telling you that this exists in every city in the U.S.; Austin isn't unique-- it's common in progressive churches and in fundamentalist ones.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   I love being entertained at these churches.&nbsp; You can also differ in major theological viewpoints with the pastor, but because you're sitting 10,000 feet away from him, and he's so nice and funny, you don't even try to ""chalk it up.""&nbsp; You just show up occasionally and brag to your friends about the rock concert you get to attend each week.   And one day, you just wake up after a hard night of life on Saturday night, and decide to sleep in and watch your pastor on his next televised viewing.   4)&nbsp; The  emotional  churches are often branded as fundamentalist, but my take is that they're the most compelling, because they actually deal with reality, or at least part of it.&nbsp; They focus on human frailty, which is what we all lay awake praying about at 4:30 in the morning when it's still dark and we realize we're screw ups.&nbsp;   ""If we could only speak in tongues, God could hear us.""   ""If we're sick and have a little faith, God can heal us.""   ""If we're having an affair, God can send us a Christian&nbsp;to save us.""   There's a certain truth to this, methinks.&nbsp; And there's a certain condemnation that makes us depressed and inferior.&nbsp;   And we wake up one morning and decide to go to Gruene Hall instead, 'cause we're sluts/bad people anyway.   -------------------------------------------------------   Ironically, in the end, I'd like to get up one day a week and gather with people who respect a portion of all the above descriptions.&nbsp; I'd  like  some tradition.&nbsp; I'd  like  people to care about my kids.&nbsp; I'd  love  some coolness.&nbsp; I'd  like  for people to call me out when I'm messing up as a person.   In my view, it would be neat to have a  Breakfast Club  church, where you have the geek, the athlete, the princess, the outcast, and the reprobate all hanging out together and learning something.&nbsp;   Because after all, aren't we  all  the geek, the athlete, the princess, the outcast, and the reprobate?

11631,3994464,"21,July,2004",2004-07-21,"   Deny thySelf, yet love thy neighbor as thySelf .&nbsp;   Huh?   What did Christ mean when He talked about our relationships with our Selves?&nbsp; Much church doctrine is centered on ""Self sacrifice.""&nbsp; It's hard to comprehend sacrificing someone/thing called mySelf when I don't know her very well.&nbsp; If my spiritual pursuits have been, up to now, focused on denying mySelf, then how can I love someone else like I love mySelf?&nbsp;   Here's a&nbsp;mom; here's an analogy:&nbsp; I constantly struggle with smoking.&nbsp; I deny mySelf (sometimes), but feel SO deprived.&nbsp; Because I see not being able to occasionally smoke as deprivation,&nbsp;I then treat mySelf as a deprived person.&nbsp;   So then, I have these kids.&nbsp; When they ask to go to the movies, my automatic answer is nearly always no.&nbsp; So I love my neighbor as I love mySelf.&nbsp; My deprived Self.&nbsp; While this isn't a justification for smoking, since I'm changing my views on it these days, I spent years where that has literally been part of my existence.   SO...   Of all places, I think I figured something out while going to the bathroom this morning.&nbsp; My teens were pouncing around outside the door trying to get me to agree to yet another endless solution to summer boredom.&nbsp; My instinct was to yell, ""SHUT. UP. NOW.&nbsp; JEEZ!""   For some reason, the adage, ""Do unto others as you would have them do unto you"" popped into my head.&nbsp; Suddenly, it wasn't about the fact I was powdering MY nose.&nbsp; I was hurled to the outside of the bathroom door.&nbsp; And my face turned red, because I remembered earlier this morning when my son was in the bathroom downstairs and I was knocking incessantly to tell him to hurry so we could make his doctor's appointment.&nbsp; Yep.&nbsp; Them apples fall very near my tree.   I got to thinking about it, and how I'd felt when, during the earlier bathroom incident, my son had yelled, ""GOD! MOM!&nbsp; I'M! COMING!&nbsp; JEEZ!""&nbsp; And I guess I do believe in being ""filled with the Spirit"" after all-&nbsp; because as I remembered that, something came out of my mouth that was other-than-Melinda:&nbsp; (calm) ""Guys, I'm in the bathroom.&nbsp; I'll come out there and love on ya' in just a second.""&nbsp; Yeah, I know.&nbsp; Pretty cool.&nbsp; They'd already moved on to bigger and better things by then, but it still had an impact.   Ok, so back to mySelf.&nbsp; I felt really good about mySelf when I did that.&nbsp; I was like, ""Damn.&nbsp; You're the bomb.""&nbsp; And I still recognized God was involved because a) I was thinking about Christ's teachings when it happened, and b) I responded like He probably would've.&nbsp;   So there was this little lightbulb that went off:&nbsp; What if sacrificing one's Self is about sacrificing the crap that makes us feel like losers (like yelling at people)...the stuff that makes us loathe ourselves and panic that we're going to Hell?   Could it be that it's all one sweet, vicious cycle?&nbsp; I love you, you love me, we're a happy family?&nbsp; If I love you, I love me.&nbsp; If I love you, my sense of Self becomes heightened.&nbsp; I want to treat mySelf with the same love I give to you.&nbsp; If I love you, I expect- no, desperately desire- you to love me back.&nbsp; I'm as weird as they come, but my tiny little brain has to wrap itself around these concepts in order to fully invest mySelf in pursuing Jesus' way of living.

11632,3994464,"21,July,2004",2004-07-21,"   The anticipation of school reconvening loomed large in this household. The feeling was mutual, punctuated by doors slamming, complaints of the crapola food they had to eat here, and my whining about the plethora of computer viruses accidentally downloaded on my computer by ""no one.""  I liken the environment to pre-Christmas, where shopping and baking makes for one bitchy Mommy. But the grand day of its arrival creates a psychological block that prevents the memories of the previous days to intrude. Come to think of it, childbearing also produces the same effect.  So, I stumble out of bed at the ungodly hour of 7:50 a.m. to transport the teens to their respective campuses. I'll add here that it is sheer bliss when children come of the age to not only dress and feed themselves, but to shun your advances to assist. God's so good in that regard, ain't He?  Turning left from my neighborhood street onto Bee Caves Drive during the school year is tantamount to proceeding left on 5th Avenue in Manhattan during peak hours. One needs a cabbie or public transport. Given that we have neither, and the kids have informed me that the school bus is wacked, uncool, too early, and above all, downright  dangerous , I am relegated to driving them for a few days out of guilt. This, too, shall pass. It always does for me.  Ten minutes after approaching the intersection, a kind gentleman lets me in and we're off to the races. I drop Amanda, the sophomore-with-a-sassy-haircut, at the high school. As she crosses the street, I see two Abercrombie OC-type boys checking her out. For some reason, this pissed me off, but I veered away from them right before I got too close.  As we approached Troy's junior high, it was obvious that every parent had fallen hook, line and sinker for the ol' ""the bus is wacked, uncool, too early, and above all, downright  dangerous "" speech. And apparently, they weren't too happy about it. There was no friendliness. There were no smiley waves like we do at football games. Instead, we sat in a line, brows furrowed-- determined to hold our place in line and  not. let. anyone. cut .  As we finally approached the school entrance, I had practiced deep breathing and turned to ruffle my baby's hair before he exited the car. ""I lov..."" The door slammed. He waved behind his back without looking at the car. Sigh. I'm a chauffeur, that's all.  40 minutes later, I arrive home from the three-mile roundtrip trek to the schools. I breathe deeply again and proceed to do the following:  1. Take a long, hot bath. (Boring. Took 5 minutes.)  2. Drank coffee and checked email. (10 minutes.)  3. Listened to talk radio. (Sigh. 3 minutes.)  4. Checked email again. (Why don't I have any friends? 1 minute.)  5. Blow dried hair. (4 minutes. )  6. Tried to take a morning nap. (10 minutes.)  7. And so on.  By mid-afternoon:  1. Decide I should volunteer at each of the kids' schools one day a week.  2. Read their schools' websites to acclimate myself to their upcoming events.  3. Wonder if Amanda knows that there's an audition after school this afternoon?  4. Call Amanda's school to leave message about audition after school this afternoon.  5. Wonder what time Troy's football practice is over?  6. Call Troy's school to inquire.  7. Decide to take Troy and friend to McDonald's to celebrate their first day of school.  8. Call friend's Mom to let her know and learn she's picking them up. Already arranged by Troy.  9. Try to take a nap.  10. Write in this blog.  Life's so sweet when the kids are back in school. I give it three days and they'll be calling me to ask that I deliver some of my ""crapola food"" for lunch.  Ciao for now.   "

It was good to see a bunch of people I haven't seen in a long time. I got a chance to kind of show off my portfolio. Good for me.  Maggie and I talked a bit, not a whole lot, she had a party Saturday afternoon. Got lots of graduation money, that's always good. She then took off to her internship, so we talked a bit on Sunday in between flights  Father's Day was just bad. We all woke up feeling like it was going to be a bad day. Maybe a self-fulfilling prophesy. Dad was just grouchy all day, and when my sister tried to talk to him about his gift he just kind of blew her off. Really made us want to get him something, oh well, seems to happened on ""special days"". There's something about the pressure to happy that makes everyone edgy. It's too bad. It'll get better.

It's nice here, probably somewhere around 80. Seems just about right after being in Walla Walla. Oh, well, whatever.  I talked to Maggie this morning, she's returning a bracelet she got for graduation from her parents. It's REALLY nice, but she doesn't really wear bracelets and she wants to have something she'll wear a lot. She's looking at rings and necklaces. The bracelet is either white gold or platinum (I didn't find out for sure), and had like .9 carets of diamonds, so it wasn't cheap... Lucky girl.  Well, that's about it for now. Yoga wasn't so great this morning. I think I'll keep looking, maybe I'll end up getting a video and do it at home, we'll see.  Well, have a good one!  "

Maggie and I and the way to Jimmy Buffet  Her dad got tickets to see Jimmy Buffet, and she talked him into getting me a ticket. It was SO much fun! He's the king of hedonism. The parking lot was the biggest tailgate party buffet I've ever seen. It was ten acers of kiddie-pools filled with hard liquer, wet T-Shirt contests, jello shots, pirate flags, shark decorated minivans, and so many CRAZY things! Some people hauled in a full tiki bar and like a 20 foot square patch of sand! I could not believe how many people were fans.    As you can see, Jimmy has a Taquila named after one of his songs...  Maggie and I danced and sang the bits of songs we knew, got covered in dancing drunk fan's beer, and smelled ""the weed"" a lot. I could NEVER live like that , but it's kind of fun to visit it once and a while a get perspective, or maybe I just secretly want to be a pirate...

24057,3998459,"07,July,2004",2004-07-07,"   Well, it's been a while since I've posted, but I guess there are adages for that, huh? Anyway, I found a really good price for a flight back to Illinois, so I jumped on it, and now I sit, in pre-flight, waiting for the gates to open and allow the flood of really unhappy travelers to surge down  the poorly decorated, tan hall way, and burst through the the cabin door, to be greeted by a southern stewardess named Sandy.  ""Hi-ah, waly-cuhm to flaht number tew say-van fowr. Nown stahp sur-vi-ehs to Chic-ah-gow Meed-wahee. Thu cri-oo woooood lahk to thang-k yoo fowr flah-yin Ayee Tu-ee Ayee Ehr-lahns! Nahw, in-joe-y the flaht noahw, ya heer?""  Some how, the thought of putting my life in this women's hands is scary,  somehow comforting, but not reassuring in anyway. Although, the thought of her perky self fly the plane is almost better than a pilot so sleep deprived he can't remember he's flow from Orlando to Las Vegas to Portland and hopped a commuter to Seattle.  I guess I'm just ranting now. But, seriously, we go through like five hours of security checks only to find out the planes are pretty much flying themselves.  Here's an annoying side note: I go into a Starbucks that is conveniently located at the exit of security, and get a Black Tea Lemonade. I ask the guy if they have a T-Mobile Hotspot, and he says no, bummer for me. But, he says, he knows that this corridor has wireless internet! Great, I say, and I thank him. I get my drink, and find a seat by a plug in. I start up my computer and wait for it to boot. It does. But, lo and behold, no Wi-Fi service, at least my computer doesn't think so. So I check it's settings, and MY COMPUTER LIED! There it is: ERAIR. So I click on it, and it asks for a password. Well, suffice to say it's evidentially an internal work wireless, 'cause I CAN'T GET ON IT! Kind of bothered me. So, now I'm typing this in NotePad and saving it so upload later. I'm also not getting any work done, which in all actuality has nothing to do with there being no Wi-Fi and more to do with me being lazy. Wireless internet tends not to help laziness. Therefore, I'm perturbed.  I saw The Terminal with Tom Hanks and Catherine Zeta-Jones, about a week ago, and if you've seen it you know that on of Tom Hank's character's friends is an Indian Custodial worker. He kind of walks hunkered over and likes to watch people ignore the ""Wet Floor"" signs. Well, as I'm sitting here a custodial worker for SeaTac walked by pushing the exact same cart, and walking in the exact same hunkered way! If the guy in The Terminal was working at SeaTac and not JFK, and if he was of European decent and not Indian, that would have been him. Fun for me, none for the people who didn't see the movie.  There's a play set and the end of this seating area. You know like the ones that came out in the late 80's/early 90's. They're blue and green, with a red slide, and they look like they're inflatable, but really they are made of hard plastic. They are reminiscent of fantasy cottages. Anyway, it's just sitting there at the end of the alcove that houses a couple of gates, A4 and 5, I think. Kids are crawling all over it, but it seems so out of place. They should be in a backyard, with a tall wooden fence, and have a grass floor, not a carpeted one. I think I may be becoming WAY too picky, but honestly, who puts a other yard accessories in an airport? You don't see garden hoses, and plastic Flamingos, and mailboxes! Not to mention the lack of that tall wooden fence. I think that's fairly definitive. Yes? No? Maybe?  Well, I suppose I should wrap this up, I'm supposed to board in fifteen minutes and my plane doesn't seem to be here. That's cause for concern. Maybe it's on the other side... Maybe it's been delayed... MAYBE I'M AT THE WRONG GATE! That's not good. All this negative thinking has got my all mixed up.  So, one last thought to leave you with. Do you ever feel like, when you're inline to board the plane, and even though you have an assigned seat, and you are guaranteed that seat, it says so on the ticket, that you will get to the front of the line and the lady will go, ""I'm sorry, planes full."" And then pull the little tube-like gate thingy closed infront of you? I do, and it it keeps me up at nights!  Well, the plane showed up, good for it. I guess I'll write sometime else. I'm good like that.  "
24058,3998459,"16,August,2004",2004-08-16,"   Saturday was a very good day! I was at a Leadership Conference for the first part of the day, really encouraging, I needed it! Anyway, yea for me.   Lauren and Seth were just one of those couples that everyone expected to get together, they were really close friends all through Middle School and High School, but they never dated each other. They dated others, but no one ever really fit. They finally got together last summer. It was SO special to see them together, they were very obviously in love, but you didn't feel uncomfortable around them.  Lauren and I graduated togther, played in our Christian High School's worship band together, and were pretty close friends. We had a mutual friend that we were both close too, and so it was just natural for us to be friends. She's a great person, I have HUGE amount of respect for her. OH, and she also got me a job at a fruit stand one summer when I couldn't find a job. I ended up getting fired from the job, but she didn't have anything to do with that (I don't think).  Seth is an AMAZING drummer! We, too, played in the worship band together, but we really got to know each other just because the two of us are crazy, and we have a blast with each other. He plays drums in the band  urlLink Mindhead , along with another high school friend of mine, and I've become friends with them through that as well.  Ironically, of all the people I knew and were friends in high school, Lauren and Seth are ususally two of only a small handful I'm still sort of close to. They are truely good friends!  Seth Fikkert and Lauren Burr were married at sometime just after Seven Post Meridiem, August Fourteenth, Two Thousand Four in the Year of Our Lord, Jesus Christ.

24059,3998459,"09,August,2004",2004-08-09,"   Well, the summer hits just keep on coming! My dad and I went and saw the Village People and KC and the Sunshine Band! It was SO much fun. Very surreal for me, but kind of oddly reminicent for him. I guess that I have this really romanic view of the 1970's. I keep assuming that the songs I hear on the radio and in movies was what everybody listened to. I just assume that there was one type of music. People had their preferences, but basically you either listened the radio or you didn't. Well, evidentally, that's not the case. My dad was NOT into Disco at all, and come to find out, it would be like being into Pop music today. KC even compared himself to 'Nsync, saying that he was my generation's mom's Justin Timberlake. It was really enlightening.  I really felt odd, in that I never expected to see any of these people, they are out of another world, a past society that can't be accessed any more.  The Village People were SO ... the Village People! They didn't disappoint at all, nor did they exceed expectations. Just right. The guys were all the original line up, minus the Motorcycle guy (he quit in the 80's and the picked up a new guy).   The Village People Preforming  The Village People also informed everyone that most of the US has been doing the YMCA wrong. so they had this whole tutorial. It was REALLY funny! Well, I'm doing my part and spreading the word, here you go,  urlLink click here  for an animated tutorial.  It was SO much fun, my only regret was that Maggie couldn't be there. My dad isn't the best dancer in the world, and it was just better to sit and watch.  "

24061,3998459,"02,August,2004",2004-08-02,"   Alright, I've started this post like three times, I've uploaded the photo and then ... I space out! Anyway, I'm going to follow through this time.  OK, so I know I left IL like three weeks ago, and I should have posted this like the day after it happened but, I didn't. So, deal.  As far as show value Jimmy Buffet wins hands down, but for venue: K.D. Lang at Ravinia Park. The place is AMAZING! Ravinia Park is, as it sounds, a park, except it's built around a large ampatheater. Also, adding to the unique quainess to the show, is that people treat going to a concert at Ravinia like a day at Ascot. Crowds show up in droves hours early, so that they can setup their elaborate picknics. People actually bring candelabra and table cloth-covered wagons come table and fine wines and foods and, coolest of all, some even bring chandelars to through over the baughs of the trees. It's an amazing experience!    I didn't get a great shot of the stage or the park (I'm a smart cookie), so here's a cute one of Maggie and I!  Maggie, her friends Aaron and Etson, and I went to the show together. We brought goat cheese and water crackers, stuff for sandiches, a very good Brie-wrapped-with-pastry-sheets-and-brown-sugar-thing that Maggie made, some non-acoholic Cabernet Sauvignon (long story, but someone won't be celebrating anytime soon), and I don't know what all, oh yeah, grapes, really good green grapes. Etson ate most of them...  After we ate and listened to the concert for a while, Maggie and I decided to walk around and look at all the scenery. Aaron was studying for something so we left him and Etson, who was still eating, to their own devices.    Aaron studying at Ravinia...  We walked among the gay and lesbian couples, K.D. Lang is a fairly proud lesbian, so political as well as musical supporters came to the show, looking at all the really well decorated tables surrounded entirly by men. Lesbians lose points for decor, sorry, but it's true. Anyway, we walked through the park and it was the most amazing movie moment of my life so far. Ms. Lang was singing a Tony Bennett cover, the sun was about to set, and the twinkle lights in the trees were on. Maggie and I danced under a very large shade tree, and it was REALLY romantic.  Anyway, we had a great time!  "

14280,4008161,"23,July,2004",2004-07-23,"   This is the boy I am obsessed with.&nbsp; This is how I think of him: genius guitar god&nbsp;exuding joy and love that crowns him like&nbsp;a halo as he bends over, intent upon creating something beautiful.&nbsp; This is me: the unseen person behind the door,&nbsp;peering through the window for a glimpse of&nbsp;what I can never have but want with all my being.&nbsp;&nbsp;I can do nothing but obsess over him from far away, listen to his music and imagine that it is for me,&nbsp;wait for him to look up and spot my eager face, framed by the&nbsp;jail-cell window.&nbsp; Will he catch my eye and grin?&nbsp; Will he come out to meet me?&nbsp;&nbsp;Will he invite me inside?&nbsp; Or will he just smile sadly, pick up his guitar, and&nbsp;climb&nbsp;up the steps, even further out of reach?&nbsp;   This is new to me - this longing, this&nbsp;lowly position of dependence.&nbsp; Is this payback for always being the bitch?&nbsp; The tables have turned, and now I am the one crying, wishing, waiting.&nbsp; The thing is, I don't even mind.&nbsp; I know I am pathetic, but that knowledge does not&nbsp;create any feelings of shame or remorse at my&nbsp;revelations of&nbsp;undying love and my&nbsp;desperate yearning for reciprocation.&nbsp;&nbsp;Surprisingly, I do not feel sad.&nbsp; This is his power;&nbsp;the mere thought of Him, even if it is not&nbsp;a happy one, makes me smile.&nbsp;&nbsp;   I analyze his every word, his every punctuation mark, searching for clues -&nbsp;clues to Him.&nbsp;&nbsp;Calling forth&nbsp;the obsessive analyzation skills built into&nbsp;every female, I ponder the millions of possible meanings in his&nbsp;IMed sentance fragments.&nbsp; Long afterwards, I replay&nbsp;our conversations over and over again in my mind.&nbsp; Why did he say it that way?&nbsp; What if he meant this?&nbsp; No, he meant this.&nbsp; But wait!&nbsp; Remember when he said that?&nbsp; Oh yeah, so he must have meant&nbsp;this!&nbsp; The choices are mindboggling, and I drive myself crazy.&nbsp; But I love it.&nbsp; I love him.&nbsp; I love everything connected to him, even if it is my doubts.   He hasn't talked to me in a while.&nbsp; But I don't mind - I'll wait.&nbsp; A month ago, I would have&nbsp; ruthlessly mocked any girl who let herself be used by a boy in this way.&nbsp; But now, I don't care -&nbsp; I have been injected with this new sense of hope and optimism.&nbsp; Any embarassment I feel is immediately erased by the prospect of talking to him.&nbsp; I try to wean myself off of him.&nbsp; I am not going online today, i say.&nbsp; I refuse to call him.&nbsp; But it doesn't last.&nbsp; What if he is waiting for me?&nbsp; What if he thinks I am mad at him?&nbsp; What if he gets mad at me?&nbsp; What if....and the infinite number of what-ifs drives me to the computer screen, where I log on to my desktop - a photo of him hugging me.&nbsp; In the picture, I am ecstatic, and staring at it as I wait for the internet connection makes me realize how happy I am now - I'm going to talk to him.     &nbsp; "
14281,4008161,"23,July,2004",2004-07-23,"   I&nbsp;don't know why&nbsp;I created this blog -&nbsp;I do not flatter myself into thinking that anything I write is important or original enough to influence others.&nbsp; I am your typical, white, upper-middle-class teenage girl who likes to think she is special.&nbsp; I do keep a journal - a small, black notebook.&nbsp; I never let anybody read it, not because it protects deep, dark secrets that have the potential to&nbsp;ruin my reputation (if I have one), but because I have never written for anybody but myself.&nbsp;&nbsp;   The notebook is full.&nbsp; Yesterday, I filled the last pages exactly two years after I bought it and wrote my first entry.&nbsp; My two year anniversary.&nbsp; Should I celebrate?&nbsp; Celebrate two years' worth of embarassments, fights with parents, random crushes, and bad, experimental poetry?&nbsp;   In an attempt at nostalgia, I tried to read over some of my past writing, but I couldn't.&nbsp; Honestly, I felt so embarassed at the raw emotion that came through that i slammed the book shut and stuffed it back into its place at the corner of my desk.&nbsp; All the things I was so passionate about a year ago, a month ago, I don't care about anymore.&nbsp; I've moved on, and I cringe as I read my dramatic words and remember things I would rather forget.&nbsp; And then I wonder, all these&nbsp;things I&nbsp;am experiencing now -&nbsp;all the things that are&nbsp;really important to me now -&nbsp;in a few weeks or months, will they have&nbsp;assumed the status of embarassing trivialities that I once obsessed over?&nbsp; It is reassuring yet frustrating at the same time.&nbsp; While it is a comfort to remember that&nbsp;my present worries will soon pass, I resent the idea that my present worries and obsessions are not as important as I think they are.&nbsp; I would rather get pissed over these tiny little problems than go through life chanting, it could be worse, it could be worse.&nbsp;&nbsp;   By the way,&nbsp;I hate that whole philosophy of putting things into perspective.&nbsp;&nbsp;Every time I complain about school or illness or&nbsp;a disagreement with a friend, my parents always tell me to Put It into Perspective.&nbsp; It could be worse, they say, you could be starving in Africa, living in a tiny hut with ten siblings.&nbsp;&nbsp;How can you complain about your mild case of strep throat&nbsp;when&nbsp;millions of people are suffering from AIDS? they ask me.&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, because I don't have AIDS.&nbsp; And is it really my fault that I have plenty of food in my fridge, or that I live in a nice house?&nbsp; I don't see why I should pretend to be completely happy all of the time&nbsp;just because somebody else's life is worse.&nbsp;&nbsp;  I admit&nbsp;I&nbsp;sound like a&nbsp;brat, but if you think about it, Putting Things into Perspective basically guarantees that you won't experience&nbsp;raw emotion.&nbsp; Unlike many others, I think of emotion as an asset rather than a weakness.&nbsp;&nbsp;So many people distrust their natural instincts.&nbsp; they tell me not to let myself get carried away by my feelings - don't make a decision until you have calmed down.&nbsp; But they are kidding themselves - all those people who profess to be objective -&nbsp;we are all human, and we all let our feelings influence us.&nbsp; And that is not necessarily a bad thing.&nbsp;   So...yes, this&nbsp;webpage&nbsp;will be filled with my random thoughts and&nbsp;adolescent&nbsp; angst.&nbsp; I apologize, but these are my problems; they may seem petty and routine, but they are all&nbsp;mine.

14282,4008161,"18,August,2004",2004-08-18,"   It was one of those Matrix-like scenarios where everything you think is real turns out to be an illusion. In the dream, my parents were throwing me a grad party, and I was at the airport to pick up one of my friends. In the US Airlines terminal, Antonio Banderas, wearing a long black leather coat and dark glasses approached me and told me I was adopted. Of course, I laughed at him and told him to leave, but then, he showed me Proof (do not know what that proof was, but it was sufficient to make me believe his claims). So then, he told me that if I wished, my real father would explain everything to me at my grad party. Of course I consented, though in real life, I wonder why I would ever consent to let this man and my real father into the house inhabited by my imposter parents.  When I arrived home that day, my house was not at my driveway but had been replaced by my middle school as if a forklift had just picked it up and moved it. My family was nowhere to be found, but my party had already begun (even though it wasn't scheduled for another week). I met Antonio Banderas inside, and he directed me into a back room, where he set up a laptop computer. He then proceeded to show me webpages and articles that explained who my father was - a member of death row who had been in federal prison all of my life. Antonio Banderas informed me that the authorities have no idea who my mother is, and they only recently tracked me down. My father was a murderer. The pointer finger of his right hand was longer than his middle finger, and he was such a ruthless killer, his nickname was ""Trigger Finger."" I stared in horror at the photos of my father's mutated hand before screaming profanities at Antonio Banderas and running from the room.  I ran from my party and continued to sprint as far away as possibble. I thought I heard somebody chasing me, so I kept running until I couldn't anymore. I ran until I fell, gasping, onto my knees. Clutching my side, I stumbled to my feet only to recognize the ruins of Alcatraz Prison, just off the California coast. When I looked down at my muddy hands, the pointer finger of my right hand was longer than my middle finger.   I jerked awake at 5 a.m, sweating profusely. Trailing my hand across the walls for support, I scrambled into the bathroom and flipped on the light switch, ignoring the cry of my pupils as they shrunk. I fingered my right hand, measuring the fingers over and over again. In the mirror, my eyes were red and moist, my skin pale beneath my tan. I splashed myself with cold water and returned to bed, clutching my pillow. "

5360,4015298,"17,August,2004",2004-08-17,"   Wow - time really flies whether you're having fun or not. It's been quite a while (over a week, in fact) since I actually made it here to put some words down on, er - what exactly is this?? It's not paper - and it's not even necessarily in black and white - so I don't know quite what to call it. Cyber-perpetuity? (is perpetuity spelled correctly? I suppose I'll have to check now to see.)  Any-hoo, back to my dilemma. For a week or so now, every time I MADE myself find the time to come out here put down something for someone somewhere to read, I got sidetracked. I supposed I could blame it (initally) on Jen and Paula - or maybe on blogger itself - for listing soooo many other more interesting blogs to look at!  I have read so far about everything from the x-rated antics of an oversexed exec and his barely-legal office assistant to logs about a professional massage ""therapist"" who offers to see her clients through to ""completion"" to a typical Chinese college student's life and experiences with her boyfriend and an assorted cast (this was quite interesting as it was written in English - perhaps because the UK still holds Hong Kong, or used to, whichever). I also have read some very interesting commentaries by several conservative political pundits - which I found particularly interesting and which kept me busy for a couple of hours as I clicked on link after link after link, getting myself deeper and deeper into the chain of blogs. I read one blog by a young girl whose birthday is the same day as my oldest daughter - maybe a couple of years earlier - so I read it simply for that reason. She talked about college life and piercings and tattoos and which of her friends were sleeping with the others also. Let's see... oh YES - there is the continuing saga of the california bar bouncer and company - quite amusing.  Most of these well put-together cyber journals makes me wonder why I even bother attempting to entertain myself - let alone anyone else - with my own rants and raves. But then again, I only started this thing for the sole purpose of bashing a certain scum sucking sewer rat and exorcising a few of my own demons.  Maybe I should just have another piece of cake and a glass of milk and call it a night - right now I'm much more in the mood to read about Kashmir's travels in the Peruvian rain forest than to pour out my guts or worry about correct use of grammar and punctuation.  I do have a few ideas for future posts, so I'm making a list here - in case I forget:  1) reconnecting with old high school friends/classmates  2) why I'm ready for my 20 y/o daughter to get out from under my house and out on her own  3) why so many men are homophobic and yet - they all seem to have a fascination with trying to convince a woman to try anal sex (ok - just threw this one in to see if you were still awake)  4) my ex-husband, the moron and his slutty sidekick I call my stepwife  5) funny resume blunders I've actually read first-hand (this one should be put into book form, published, and make me a rich woman)  6) people who drive down the e-way in the left hand lane - but not going faster than the right hand lane - as if they consider themselves the official pacecar of the canyon e-way  7) why i'm a selfish horrible person and I know it, but can't seem to help myself  8) are there ANY good men left out there who can appreciate me - oh hell - are there any good men out there, period????  later.... osm"
5361,4015298,"09,August,2004",2004-08-09,"   Ok here - here I sit bawling - I'm supposed to be working, and I have been - with the radio playing country music in the background. There was a PLAIN and simple reason why I gave up Country Music after I separated and then divorced - it just freakin' depresses the HELL out of me!! But my oldest daughter likes it, and some of the stuff today is really good, so lately I've found myself listening to it more and more - BIG MISTAKE.  And now, as I sit here sorting through resumes and making my daily calls to hiring managers and candidates, in my subconscious I hear the words to a song by Gary Allan come pouring out over the air waves. It's a song about a daddy's love for his little girl - I believe it's entitled ""Tough Little Boys"". It's all about how this grown man is turned all to mush watching his little girl grow and change - and all the inevitible emotional tugs there will be - watching her take her first steps, go off to school, get married, etc....  Which brings me to the cause of my tears. My own little angel lies sleeping in her bed - my GOD she is beautiful - with her golden blonde hair, but dark, dark THICK eyelashes laying on porcelain skin. Just as beautiful when she's awake, because she has eyes of the BLUEST, truest BLUE you've ever seen - not sky blue, and not dark - just brilliant BLUE. Anyway - this song makes me so painfully aware that my baby's father goes about his daily routine without even sparing a thought for her existence, let along her well-being - and certainly she will never hear him say how he watched in with the most thrilling trepidation as she took her first steps, or how he cried like a baby and followed her school bus all the way into town on her first day of school, or how he knows some day he'll have to give her away - he's already done that. He did it the night we made her. He did it the minute he told me he loved me and wanted to live with me forever - with the first lie that came from his lips. It makes me want to pick up the phone and call Mr. Randy Brison (see, I made it almost a whole month before I actually used his name - hence the tootsie pop reference) and tell him what a pathetic person he is - and how I ALMOST feel sorry for him.  She is awake now; I can hear her over the baby monitor - lying in her bed, singing a song that only a two-year-old can compose. She is precious. She holds the world in her tiny little hands - it is hers to hold fast or to throw away. Anything is possible for her - except her father's love. I hate him for that. Fuck him. What a loser - who could do this to their own child?? I don't mind that he changed his mind about wanting me - I'm a big girl, I'll get over it. How will she?  She already has used the word ""dad"" to mean ANY person of the male persuasion, not knowing that it is supposed to be reserved for the male person who, if he didn't donate the dna to create you at least cares more about you than any other in the world and would die so that you might live. Don't get me wrong - I know there are LOTS of dads who suck - my ex-husband has let my older kids down so many times it is unreal, but at least they KNEW who he was. At least he managed to have a few bright and shining moments - and has wanted to know about them and hug them and tell them he loved them. It's a different kind of pain when they at least KNOW what ""dad"" is supposed to mean than it is when trying to explain to a child that ""dad"" isn't just a random word. It is supposed to have purpose and meaning - and a face to see yourself in, and arms to pick you up and hold you, and lips to kiss away your fears/tears/boo-boos.  AAARRRRGGGGHHHH - these are the days when I wonder how stupid I really am. How could I have thought it would be fair to her to bring her into this world and to keep her myself??? And yet - anything else would just not have been an option for me. Which is the bottom line - she is for me. I wanted her. I needed her. Far more than she will ever need me - I hope that doesn't become a weight around her neck. I will have to work very hard to let her be her and to live her life without worrying who's going to be there for Mom.  Like I said - I'm a big girl, I can take it. I just wish my little girl had a daddy - HER daddy - and in a moment of true weakness - I wish he had her, too because he's the one who's really missing out.... osm"

The post was entitled ""I Have No Right To Tell Them How To Live Their Lives!"" I actually wrote this post as a comment, but it turned out so long, I couldn't post it there (they have a 1000 word limit). So, I just said I enjoyed the comments and left my URL. So, without further comment - here is what I wrote:"
5363,4015298,"02,August,2004",2004-08-02,   I have no idea what I'm going to write about today. I just know that I haven't been here in a whole week and I probably should write something.
5364,4015298,"02,August,2004",2004-08-02,"   Hey! I received my first comment tonight on my blog. That was a funny feeling, I must say (thank you, Ed Grimly)."
4293,4022192,"24,July,2004",2004-07-24,"   i figure if you wanna get to know me, you gotta know my friends first. thoughit's a little more complicated than that. you see, i call myself a floater.not because i can swim or anything, which, as terrible as it is, i cannot,but because i travel between different groups of friends. sure i miss somethings. but hey, i love all of them in their own ways, and i don't not mindnot being a part of only one group, i love it that way.    Group One  description: seven mostly cute, straight-edge, soon-to-be college freshmen (except one), one of whom is my  urlLink boyfriend .  reasons why i love them: eight boys + one girl = attention galore. greatmovie-partners, advice-givers, and cuddle-ers. easy to tickle. always a sourcefor good ""clean"" fun (though all have dirty minds). can feel like i'm corruptingthe innocent.   reasons why i don't fit in: not a guy. i like to, as they call it, party.i have created some jealous tensions, and i have more sexual experience thanten times them all combined.    Group Two  description: five fabulously fun, dare-to-be-different, new york city girls, all except one my age.  reasons why i love them: ROCKY HORROR GAL PALS (equally in love and obsessedwith both the cast and the movie itself). actresses all. intelligent conversationalists.internet trend-setters. seem to feel blessed to have me. best underwear partiesever.   reasons why i don't fit in: they're too damn intelligent. while i maybe up to their acting, i cannot sing for the life of me. i cannot keep upwith their trivia and have not been around from the beginning, and in fact,was hated in the beginning.    Group Three  description: three almost as short, same-aged, fly chicas.  reasons why i love them: goofy as all hell. love categorically girliethings (shopping, boys, etc.). always excited for a night out. have wonderfulsame-size-as-me clothes.   reasons why i don't fit in: they're too damn pretty, and i'm afraidof competition over boys, grades, etc.. i have friends of whom they don'tapprove.    Group Four  description: too many to count riotous alchies and the like. aka, any thing's funny when you're that fucked up.  reasons why i love them: source for any drug, and center for drunkendebauchery. understand a need for ""relaxation."" parents are always away.serve up cute guys and good times.   reasons why i don't fit in: have drifted away from them recently findingother passions. i care too much about school and am never up on the gossip.   Group Five  description: two i-hate-everything-so-choose-to-be-outcast sorta-punk boys.  reasons why i love them: really chill people with interesting and differenttheories on life. fun to scare people with. good music and movies.   reasons why i don't fit in: rather soap-opera-like relationship withone of the two. i have other friends besides them. i do not hate the worldor myself (most of the time).    Group Six jess  *group order does not at all mean order in my heart  **royal apologies to those who object to being placed in stereotypicalcategories such as these. you have my permission to hit me.   ***there are also some glaring exceptions of which i am fully aware,people are part of a group but who do not reflect the picture of it i havemade. you know who you are. please don't kill me.

4294,4022192,"24,July,2004",2004-07-24,"   at the request of some very wonderful people (one in particular), and as you, my readers (that's right, all two of you), can see, i have started a blog. now, as a self-proclaimed commitment-phobe i must first warn you all that you should not expect consistent updating. you see, it is my belief that the people who would have the most to write about are too busy doing it to actually be writing about it. this is not to say that i recently have nothing to do, just that i've decided to devote an occasional hour of my life (from sometime between two and four in the morning) to the maintenance of the blog in question. but i digress. i also probably spelled that wrong. that is why for this said entry i shall propose a disclaimer:  warning. the material you are about to read (maybe next week) is not suitable for people who don't already know and love me. for only those eight million will be able to forgive the constant spelling errors and probable obsessiveness that shall comprise my ramblings to come.   my advice? sound stuff out and skim (says my insecure self)....please love meâ€”iâ€”meanâ€”it (says my vulnerable self)....suck it up and die (says my irritable self)....but most of all, read and love because anything i write turns to pure gold (says the happily me self)  "

17906,4022853,"27,July,2004",2004-07-27,"   There is one person who reads my blogs and who can figure out who I am.  I've given many clues as to who I am,  you just have to read the comments and look closely.  This may be my last blog, when you find out who I am, I have one last thing to say to you, but you have to find out who i am.  Its been fun and all, but hiding behind a name like Dark Angelique gets boring. "
17907,4022853,"26,July,2004",2004-07-26,"   Do you think aliens exist?    I personally do.    I am also a skeptic and a religious person.    It can get very confusing.    As for aliens, how can one deny the fact that life canâ€™t exist somewhere in this vast universe.    The proof is the fact that someone is reading this at all.    Humans exist in this universe and if humans can exist then why canâ€™t other beings exist also.    I mean, what are the chances that our planet is the only planet in this entire existence that is capable of supporting life.    UFO sightings are too common to all be fakes.    I mean, yes, there are people who claim to have seen UFOâ€™s and fake UFO sighting with a simple string, a tin object and camera or video camera.    These people are just looking for attention.    The sheer amounts of sightings though are too great too all be hoaxes.    As for whether aliens have landed, I donâ€™t believe it.    I donâ€™t think intelligent beings would risk an encounter with a species as destructive as us.    As for abductions, Iâ€™ve heard theories.    There is a particular one Iâ€™m very interested in.    Basically it states that these aliens are so advanced and evolved theyâ€™ve lost the ability to reproduce.    To put it simply, theyâ€™re dying.    They need our DNA and to re-sequence their own DNA to allow for reproduction.    It is also said that there will be a side effect to this.    These beings are so evolved they have lost the ability to love at all.    It is this lack affection that allows them to do the experiments they need on us to keep their way life alive, but as I was saying before the side effect of adding our DNA to their DNA is they may love again.    Itâ€™s all in our genes, how our hair looks in the brilliant sun, the way our eyes look when the moon hits them just right, and yes, love.    Itâ€™s all in our genes.    For the first time in a long time they will be able feel compassion for us and maybe there is hope for us yet.    There are two results of their compassion.    The first is them intervening in our busy lives showing us what we are doing wrong and helping us to become better beings.    The second is they destroy us before we make our way too far into the galaxy destroying and polluting planet by planet.    Either way, I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll live to see the day either happens.    Who ever reads this; Iâ€™d really like to know your feedback.    What do you think about the existence of aliens?    If youâ€™re a believer, then why do you think theyâ€™re here?    Iâ€™m signing off for the night but Iâ€™ll leave you with a little quote I heard from a friend a while ago.             â€œWhen your soul is in doubt, look to the stars for answersâ€ - anonymous "
17908,4022853,"26,July,2004",2004-07-26,"   So here I am again; alone in my room, in the dark, staring at my ceiling and listening to music.    Iâ€™m not tired because I took a nap earlier.    The dream I had though, it was terrible.    My best friend was being buried alive; I was running from people who wanted to kill me, monsters killing other monsters.    I wonâ€™t read into it too much.    I was sick today so Iâ€™m not too worried.    Staring at my ceiling I start to thinking about a lot of things.    Really at the moment Iâ€™m broken hearted.    Iâ€™ll get over it, its just this would be the 3 rd  time Iâ€™m doing this because of the same girl.    We havenâ€™t even called it off, we just havenâ€™t talked.    Itâ€™s complicated, as things always are.    Sometimes I wish I was an animal and not a person.    Animals just live their simple lives surviving while humans do the same but by no means is it simple.    We complicate things by creating all these amusement.    We go to work, make money, and after that we come home looking for entertainment.    These industries and corporations just prey on us like we weâ€™re savage pack of dogs wanting fresh meat.    This analogy isnâ€™t too far from the truth.    We go to war and kill each other almost everyday.    Some of humanity or almost all of it just sickening. We kill each other, animals, take away life everyday, pollute this earth to the point where it become uninhabitable.    We multiply at rate unheard of, like a disease almost.    My sour view towards humanity grows everyday.    I donâ€™t like what I am.    Then there are things about being human that makes up for all of that.    Love. Unfortunately my love chose to ignore me.             Isnâ€™t life just grand? "
17909,4022853,"25,July,2004",2004-07-25,"   Why is it Iâ€™m more active at night?    I enjoy the night so much more than the day.    I can stand near my window at night and just listen to the sounds that come from the darkened field.    I stare at the moon and the stars hidden behind my big tree.    Itâ€™s at night when my thinking becomes clearer but itâ€™s also when everyone goes to sleep so I end up being alone.    Itâ€™s okay though because I like to be left alone.    Sometimes I crave companionship but other nights I just like it when Iâ€™m by my self.    I donâ€™t know, maybe Iâ€™m just weird. "
17910,4022853,"24,July,2004",2004-07-24,"   Where is the best place to start?  How about the beginning.  I am 17 years old, and ultimately this is to get things off my chest.  I fully realize that people will read this but donâ€™t be so hard to judge me based on what I write.  I write when Iâ€™m upset and that causes me to write very sour things towards humanity.  Sometimes I question existence entirely.    Why do people do the things they do or say things they donâ€™t mean.    How can people go to sleep so comfortably knowing that theyâ€™ve hurt someone.    When thereâ€™s anger between two people the outcome is usually very bad.    Perhaps ill post later when my minds more clear.    Iâ€™m afraid all the thoughts in my head are just flying everywhere right now. "
17911,4022853,"18,August,2004",2004-08-18,"   Went to the beach a couple days ago with some friends.  She was there.  I remember one moment were she was lying down on the blanket in the sand, and her hair just light scattered across her face.  And then the sun hit her red hair so perfectly, she was the most beautiful thing in the world.  I wish i had a camera.  But i can see it so vividly in my mind.  I wish I could tell her this and it hurts sometimes when I know I cant.  She's on my mind a lot, especially at night when I cant sleep.  I've been hanging out with her a lot, and I talk to her every chance I get.  She still has no idea :(  I still can't tell her until im sure.  I just wish that day would be soon.  Dearest friend, how do i find words for what my heart desires....  Im sorry if you people dont wanna read this, thats okay, its just what im dealing with these days.  Perhaps my blogs will be better in the future.... "

17913,4022853,"11,August,2004",2004-08-11,"   I cant sleep.  Im trying to but i cant do it.  Everytime i close my eyes i see her.  The one my effection has been towards.  I talk to her online everyday now for hours on end.  I think im beginning to really care for this person but how to tell her?  I plan to see her friday.  If there was an opportunity to tell her it would be that day.  I still dont know how to tell her.  There's also, the rejection factor.  I've never told someone i've liked them unless i was absaloutly sure they liked me back.  This is different becuase im not sure.  I feel i should wait to tell her how i feel but if i wait too long i might miss the opportunity.  Perhaps i should wait to see if feelings grow stronger between us.  Maybe she doesnt see the connection now but she might see it later.  I dont know.  Everytime i close my eyes i see her smiling face.  I start making up scenarios in my head about friday and i know none of them will happen.  Its still nice to think about though.  I really do wish she likes me back.  Just talking to her makes me feel flushed.  Im afraid though.  If she does like me back what then?  We become boyfriend and girlfriend but still...what then?  I see her a lot...we play guitar...I dont know.  Things may get boring between us.  I dont know.  Maybe things will fall into place.  What if she doesnt like me...and i poor my heart and soul out to her.  What then?  Perhaps this is a friendship that should remain just a friendship.  Perhaps i shouldnt ruin what we've got...but if there is the chance of success...should i take it?  I dont know.  I suppose i should distract my mind if i can, after all this is just another night where I cant sleep.  ...but what if?.... "
17914,4022853,"09,August,2004",2004-08-09,   I will not try anymore.  I admit defeat...i kept fighting when all i really needed to do is give up.  In the end i win because then maybe my insides will fix themselves.  Just when things get better they get a whole lot worse.  I must free my mind from this burden.  I dont want it anymore.  Its over now.  I must keep reminding myself thats its over now.  I dont have to fight it anymore.  I had to lose to win.  I just hope twisting in my stomach subsides really soon.  I do not know how long I can endure this pain for.  Good riddens!  So much pain for such little happiness.  Not worth it.....women.  My insides do feel better now. 
17915,4022853,"06,August,2004",2004-08-06,"   I never slept tonight.  Too many things running through my head.  It was around 5 in the morning...I was sitting in bed not being able to sleep and I was thinking of ""her"".  She was everything to me.  I decided to go for a walk at that point.  So its just getting light...and im outside wandering the streets at around 5:30 in the morning.  I then get the bright idea that I may be able to see that wonderful smile of hers once more so I go to her bus stop.  Unfortunately I am unaware of the time having lost my watch at Newton Wave Pool.  So i leave and im back at my house around 6:30.  I am soaked at this point and my friend is passed out on the couch.  Im thinking to myself that if i just stayed a little bit longer i might have been able to see her once more.  Depressed i grab a nice warm bowl of soup and just sit in my back yard and get even more soaked in the cold rain while eating my warm soup.  I thought of her almost the entire time.  Writing this i am still soaked and though my mind may be weary, i still wonder if things could have been different...I always keep a faint bit of hope with me. "

"
3217,4023489,"26,July,2004",2004-07-26,"   mollie, moriah and i went to a restaurant titled the ""winward passage"" this evening, which was full of old people, wood paneled walls, and overcooked vegetables. it was exactly what i needed on a dreary, rainy columbus night like this. i love thunderstorms, and never get to see them in socal. why can't i see a rainstorm instead of all this drizzle?  spent the rest of the night at janine's, drinking red wine, and seeing her new house. now that we're 25, everyone (especially my friends in columbus from hight school) are getting to be so damn  domestic.  a house. we grew up together. have been best friends since 4th grade. she owns a house, and i'm running around all summer sleeping with strippers named juan.   speaking of, in retaliation to last night's mean, mean email, said ex-boyfriend said he owes me nothing, he's glad we're not together, and called me a slut.   first i wasn't fucked up enough for him, and now i'm a slut. i could waste my time typing all of the reasons i dumped him in the first place, but he's not worth it. i can't believe i'm wasting this much time on him now.  maybe i need drama to survive?   "
3218,4023489,"25,July,2004",2004-07-25,"   what happened to me?  i used to be so nice. too nice. i stayed with an asshole who wasn't good enough for me for too long, and just when i'm starting to get over him... i did a very un-Christian thing tonight.   i ""accidentally"" stumbled upon his weblog. not on purpose... not really. i was visiting a weblog of his friend and saw him connected, so of course i read it.   the internet is a dangerous thing.   in it he talked all about his new girlfriend,&nbsp;about how ""it's always nice"" to go over to her parents' house for dinner (what, did they start dating the night we broke up?), how they did this, that, blah blah, puke puke puke. i don't want him but the idea of him being with someone else makes me want to vomit. am i crazy?   in said weblog, he also referred to his ""psycho ex-girlfriend"" (aka me), which pissed me off but then i thought, he's right! i'm stalking him on the internet!   so i did what all sensible girls would do and in an email response to him from the other night, casually mentioned that i'd slept with someone else while we were dating, which is true, but i was never going to tell him. i didn't want to hurt him. but now i do.   "
3219,4023489,"24,July,2004",2004-07-24,"   just got back from my family reunion. it seems they're getting older and shorter every year. it's always weird to me to have to introduce myself to relatives. i feel like we should just know who one another is, but we don't, so it's awkward. my aunt mabel brought a keyboard and was really getting down.  i drove with my mom and two of my cousins, and we talked the whole way about relationships and the like. i don't often hear my mom talk about such things, so it was fun but now i'm all hopped up on coffee with nowhere to go. it's another crappy day in columbus, which is why i appreciate the sun in la so much.  still thinking about the ex, with his new girlfriend. i fear he treats her better, although everyone tries to remind me that people don't change that fast.  last night i went to a party down in the victorian village and my friend brett showed up DRUNK, and started wrestling me. at first i thought it was funny but then he started getting a little too close; was it just me or was he trying to lick my neck? his hug goodbye was lingered a bit too long, too. he's probably lonely, but it was weird. he dated one of my best friends for over a year-i just can't see him that way.   "
3220,4023489,"24,July,2004",2004-07-24,"   so i finally get an email from the ex that i dumped a few months ago. before and during our breakup he gave me all of these ""people should stay friends even if it's really hard"" speeches and then... nothing from him. and we were friends beforehand, so i've been kind of hurt.   i broke up with him because he wasn't good for me-cheap, stingy, closed off, anger issues-but didn't expect silence. then, and this is the danger of the internet, i check his friendster page and see that his status is ""in a relationship."" ahhh. bad memories of a girl from his photo class he was hanging out with before and RIGHT after our breakup came speeding back. again, i know i ended it, but he wasn't exactly begging me to stay, either.   so i emailed him, thanking him for not keeping in touch with me and for letting me find out via friendster that he's dating someone else. he emailed me back saying he needs his space, and i should respect that. i do.&nbsp;i will. the bastard just should've told me this in the first place...  is she prettier? smarter? funnier? does he love her?&nbsp;fucked up?  he accused me of being too balanced, too ""normal."" hope he's having fun in a dysfunctional relationship.

3221,4023489,"24,July,2004",2004-07-24,"   today i decided to start a blog. mostly because i'm used to typing in my journal, as opposed to picking up a pen and doing it the old-fashioned way, and I'm at my mom's house, sans my jump drive. so here we are.   "
12178,4024747,"30,July,2004",2004-07-30,"   Two nights ago was the most wonderful night.  Hannah learned how to kiss, or at least was wanting us to give her kisses.  She cannot do the pucker and smack noise, but she puts her lips together and says, ""mmmm"", and then she waits for us to come in and plop one on her lips.  After that she just laughs hysterically. She gave me and Dan kisses back and forth for 15 minutes.  We tried to get it on camera, but she would only give me one and then wanted to play with the camera as always.  It really was so wonderful.  It is amazing all the new things she learns each and every day!   "
12179,4024747,"27,July,2004",2004-07-27,"   Well I guess I won't be writing every single day as a mommy's life gets very busy. Today HJ was as cute as usual.  We recently bought her new pink shoes from Target and at many times during the day, she brings them up to me to put them on her.  She loves walking around in them and especially loves the fact that she can walk outside in them.  She is so adventurous and is growing up so quickly now.  Everyday she is sounding out more words to say, like oof-oof for a dog (woof-woof).  Apart from that, here is an unusual tidbit:  We were eating McDonald's french fries tonight with a bowl of ketchup.  The next thing I know Hannah is pitching her sock in the ketchup as though that were the exact place it belonged.  It was kind of funny, but I had to tell her that was not where we put the dirty socks :) I don't think she really got it, but oh well.  She is my little angel pie.   "
12180,4024747,"24,July,2004",2004-07-24,"   My little girl is getting to be so big and grown-up.&nbsp; I am as proud as I could be of her.&nbsp; Right now she is sitting on the floor reading her Baby Einstein book so intently like she understands everything that is in it- even though she can not talk yet let alone read.&nbsp; It has all sorts of animals in it, which&nbsp;are her favorite things.&nbsp; She also is a spunky independent little girl.&nbsp; She loves looking through pictures, of which her favorite are the ones of herself.&nbsp; I have two large pictures, 8"" x 10"", of her on my dresser, and she always points to them when she wakes up from naps (she naps in our room) saying, ""dat dat"".&nbsp; That means ""that"".&nbsp; She pointed at the fish on our shower curtain today, and I told her those are fish. She said ""ish-ish"".&nbsp; Her favorite shows are Blue's Clues (the new ones with Joe), and the Wiggles.&nbsp; With the Wiggles she shakes her hips back and forth to the songs and with Blue's Clues she is just glued to the television.&nbsp; Mostly though aside from TV, she loves to just play with her toys.&nbsp; Her favorite is her green wagon for two.&nbsp; She is in and out of that all day long.&nbsp; She is in and out of every room all day long too.&nbsp; She loves her room and our room a lot.&nbsp; Those are her favorite two to explore.&nbsp; Well that is all for today.&nbsp; I thought I would just start out with some basics.&nbsp; Hope you enjoy!

12181,4024747,"16,August,2004",2004-08-16,"   Well it has been quite awhile since my last blog.  Hannah and I have been sick- I think we had the whooping cough- but I guess it is pretty prevalent in the south because of the air quality and mold and all that.  Anyway we are finally over the hump and so much has happened, but the biggest thing is that Hannah went poo-poo on the potty the first time yesterday!!  I saw she was trying to go so I rushed her in there to go to the bathroom.  She didn't really like it that much.  She fussed and cried but ended up being happy when it was over!  Anyways, the potty training is going slowly as you can probably guess.  We may have to wait awhile.  Also we decided on a name for our new baby girl- Lily Ann Cook.  (Not sure on the spelling of lily yet.) Well feel free to email me if you want to anyone- I would be happy to hear from all of you!  I will write more later!   "
12182,4024747,"02,August,2004",2004-08-02,"   Well I have a few different details about the precious little Hannah to share tonight.  Earlier today she was playing in her green wagon in the sun room.  I was watching tv in the living room.  The two rooms are completely connected just so nobody freaks out.  Anyway, the commercial with the chips ahoy chunky chocolate chips came on.  You know the one that says, ""  I'm a monkey chips ahoy, I'm alright..."", and then there is the singing clamation chocolate chip cookie and the monkeys on stage. Well Hannah heard it and perked right up. She got out of her wagon as quick as possible and ran in the the room just to see that commercial.  But by the time she got in there, it was on the tail end of the commercial. When it was over, she headed back to her wagon.  Well then I started singing the song off the commercial, because it is kind of one of those songs that just gets stuck in your head.  She turned right back around and ran in to see if it was on again.  I felt so bad, but it was so cute and funny.  I don't know what it is about that commercial, but she can hear it from  anywhere  and come running just to be able to see it.  It is the only commercial she does that with.       We also today were playing in her room. I was looking through all of our baby clothes, to get ready for the new baby girl coming along, and I found this little sleep sack that Hannah used to sleep in.  It is basically a sleeper with no feet and just a sack at the end so baby can't kick it off like a regular blanket.  I was putting it up to Hannah to size it up and see how big it was and I decided to put it on her.  Well it was a little tight, so I just unzipped it and left the top part on her arms and let the back go out like a cape.  She loved it!  She had that thing on for thirty minutes.  She was just walking around having a godd old time!  I tried to take it off of her once because I though she was getting tired of it, but when I did she started bawling.  So I quickly put it back on and she was off again!        Here is another one. This one is so funny.  One day a couple days ago, Hannah was walking around just giggling.  I conldn't really figure out what was going on until she came a little closer.  She kept lifting up her shirt, pointing at her belly button, and laughing!  It was so funny. Then she would do it all over again.  She has been doing this a couple of days now!  Well I think that is all for tonight!   "
9682,4027311,"27,July,2004",2004-07-27,"   I kinda wonder why I am even doing this whole blog thing. I could just keep a journal and leave it at that. Of course, then no one would be able to read it and I wouldn't be the subject of one of John Dvorak's   ranting & raving columns  . But that's OK; I probably never will be...    Enough about me; let's talk about ME!    I just got back from  urlLink People's Bank  in  urlLink Stop &amp; Shop  in Norwich. The tellers must be under a ton of stress, because the only folks ruder are the poor bastards at DMV (and I do feel bad for them). I was so ticked off at the poor service and exorbitant fees and charges that a couple of months ago, I went in to close the account. I'm such a sucker. They closed the account, alright. By selling me on another, improved, cheaper account. So away I went, content that I was being frugal and responsible. All I had to do was get my ATM/debit card and I was off to the races.    Excpet that the card never arrived. So after a phone call to the local branch and getting routed to Bridgeport (you always get routed to Bridgeport if the local branch doesn't pick up the phone after like, one ring), I was told that the local branch had forgotten to order the card and they would be doing it post-haste.   (Riiiiiight.)   Card still didn't arrive. Called the local branch, talked to Bridgeport (see above explanation). This time the story was that the card had been ordered, but it takes 10-15 business days to arrive. By this time, I'm starting to think I really got my money's worth out of this new account. After another couple of weeks with still no ATM card (today), I decided I would visit the local branch to find out what the hell was going on. They told me that the card was mailed 24 days ago. Would I like to cancel the card and order a new one?  Hmmmmmm. I don't know; what do you think???  So I asked if there were any possible way to get the new card rushed, since I haven't been able to use an ATM in a couple of months that I''ve had the account. Well, yessir, we can rush the card - for a $25 fee that we won't waive.    Fine.   Whatever  . I'll probably never see this new card, either. I am such a sap. I went in to close the account because they don't have a clue how to keep their customers happy or back off on the fees. Instead I have another account and still suffer the same service.    I just think banking should be transparent. You get an ATM card. You use it anywhere. You write checks anywhere. You get your statements in the mail with the cancelled checks. You don't get charged ridiculous fees every time you turn around. Simple, right? Apparently this is not an easy thing to do for these folks. I don't know if it's the people who work there or a bigger problem with the organization itself. Or maybe it's a conspiracy against me. Yeah, that's the most logical idea. "
9683,4027311,"26,July,2004",2004-07-26,"   OK, OK... So I'm the last to hear that Van Halen has welcomed Sammy Hagar back to the fold and is on tour or planning one. And they're releasing a warmed-over re-released song album ('greatest? hits'). Am I the only one who's not excited at all about this? I'm sorry, but there was only one Van Halen, and it ended sometime in 1984 (with a brief reprise when DLR contributed to a couple of newer songs for Greatest Hits, Vol. 1). They were good songs, and there were many of us fans who have too much time on our hands that were hoping for a more permanent reunion. Oh, well... Didn't happen. I still have DLR's CD's. Some were better than others, but you gotta hand it to the guy: he doesn't ever friggin' stop rockin'.  Or does he? Where is he now? I thought I hear on NPR last week that he is training to be a paramedic in NYC. I can't find his web site, either.  So is David gone from the music biz? Was the last CD (""Diamond Dave"" a.k.a. ""DLR Does Better Covers than Originals"") his last? "
9684,4027311,"24,July,2004",2004-07-24,"   This is my first blog post, ever. I'm sure that it will go down in the annals of blog history... Or not.    A little about me you can't get from my profile (because I'm too damn lazy to fill in all those text fields):    I am a single dad. It's the best job I've ever had (although sometimes I don't think I'm going to be getting a promotion anytime soon). My kids are the best.    I am a technology junkie in semi-luddite clothing. I run a small computer company (OK, it's miniscule, as in one-man show). I have way too many computers running way too many OS's. Handhelds, too (yeah, they run different OS's, too). DSL, wireless network, yada yada yada. However, I don't have cable TV. Or satellite TV. Don't get me wrong; it's not because I think those companies are evil (I   know   they are). I just don't have the cake to pay for TV I don't have the time to watch anyway. I don't have high-def  anything . My TVs are  old . (One of them I bought new in 1986!)  I play blues guitar. What? You didn't know that Connecticut is the breedin' ground for famous bluesmen? Actually, I didn't either. But here I am, playing guitars all the time. Electric and acoustic. There's like 6 or so sitting around the house. Way back when, my ex-wife used to ask me why I had five guitars. I answered, ""Because I can't afford six."" My current squeeze is a '52 Tele reissue thru a '71 Super Reverb. No stomp pedals necessary for killer tone.  I have a love affair with motorcycles, but I can't afford the addiction. My current ride is a 1971 Honda CB750, my favorite two-tone color: black and chrome. Runs great (usually), looks not so great. I guess that's what New England winters are for: overhauling bikes. If there are any antique bike riders (antique bikes, not riders), let me know.  Friends of Bill: Contact me anytime. We're trudging the road to happy destiny together. "

8607,4038842,"18,August,2004",2004-08-18,   Ever wondered why there is no real joy in this life? Why every happiness is only a short break  in this great stream of misery? THERE IS NOTHING!!! FUCKING GET IT! 
8608,4038842,"28,July,2004",2004-07-28,"   Wednesday, 28.07.2004 Seems like it`s getting a little better. A hint of summer has come this morning - the sun shines, makes it a little warmer as yesterday und enables me to produce enough serotonine not to feel as bad as yesterday. Work is slightly more fun today. Hope this is not only a little grain against the big grey rock of the other days. I wish I could have fun again... Strange to be a biomechanic organism, dependent on external factors like small water drops between me and the sun. I don`t want to be a machine! "

8610,4038842,"26,July,2004",2004-07-26,"   Tuesday, 27.07.2004  Weather is still not as it should be. Cloudy sky, low temperature, grey atmosphere...  Have to set up and try to think of any action that might fuel me despite of these negative conditions - something to look forward to, like a good meal, like getting drunk, like meeting someone...  But again, there is just coffee in here to raise my blood pressure which is near comatose. Life slowed down to an almost unrecognizable frequency...  I want summer, I want sun, I want warmth, I want laughter, I want life!!!! "
8611,4038842,"26,July,2004",2004-07-26,"   Monday, 26.07.04 Monday sucks anyway - weekend`s over, been to short, back to work... Today`s even worse - cloudy and foggy weather, low temperature, rain, depressive atmosphere, pressing me down to earth, into the earth, makes me sink into the ground. Feeling pushed into the chair, unable to make conversation, unable to follow other`s thoughts, hanging on to mine which circle around warmth, the darkness and peace of sleep, eternal sleep. Getting tired and sleepy. Coffee won`t help it, doesn`t wake up, just makes nervous.  Sitting in the office, having to read through websites like  urlLink http://www.dvd-player.pl &nbsp;- it is the job to register those... counting the minutes until this day is over and I`m able to sink into dreams of a summer that hasn`t come yet and probably won`t come this year. Let`s see what tomorrow brings.. "
8612,4038842,"18,August,2004",2004-08-18,"   Guess why there hasn`t been an update during the last two weeks... The sun was shining and I was trying to catch as much as possible of the sun`s positive energy. Lying around in the park, swimming in the lake, sitting in the evening sun, having some beers... life could go on like this FOREVER! Unfortunately, the clouds are coming back these days. Seems like summer is over this year. Back to normality, back to miserability, back to everything which is... ...nothing... "
8613,4038842,"03,August,2004",2004-08-03,"   Got up much too early due to heat, cutting sunlight and droning noises from the construction site on the street below... too little sleep can be a drug, too... Then read two mags/newspaper, both with very personal content. First, a review of my band`s first demo - and not a bad one! Feels good to read someone else is having fun with my art. Second a portrait of a lobbyist in Berlin who works in a job that I was applying for half a year ago. If I was now there... less problems, I guess... who knows... again, I feel like a leaf in a storm, being blown in any direction without almost any influence where the ground is touched. "
8614,4038842,"02,August,2004",2004-08-02,"   Sun and summer have finally arrived. Blue sky instead of grey clouds. Endorphines are set free. The skin burns and to this moment, it feels good. As good as the sweat from the heat smells... Coming to life, growing like a plant, raising towards the energyproviding mythical power in the sky, the golden burning goddess. Again, how weak must a human be to be so dependent from his surroundings? "
31086,4039381,"31,July,2004",2004-07-31,"   So we go to the tourist information office which is just off the market road, and ask which are the best places to go to. The   first thing they do is give us a map of the city, which is a geographical map and then give us a map of the underground plan   as to how to reach various locations. That is really impressive to me and all this is free. We fall out of the tourist   information office and we were feeling pretty hungry as last night out tummies were fortunate to have some slices of fried   potatoes(in short call as chips) and some drink. Vienna is not that cheap a place when it comes to food, but fortunately we   found a place.   Originally Vienna was once occupied by the Ottomann Kings(i.e.. the Turkish kings), hence Vienna has a large population of   turks living. We found a small outlet in the middle of the market street where they were selling various food delicacies from   Turkey. We did not venture into what the various food items were but safely took in the vegetable sandwhich. As expected the   vegetable sandwich did not contain only vegetables but also something called as Falafael. This is a Greek/Arabic food, which   is made of Chickpeas which are roughly groung and some basic spices such as turmeric is added, of course along with salt. And   the dough is made into small patties and these are deep fried. Sounds like our normal Vada?? yes they are, the only   difference is the flour base used. So the sandwhich consits of Pita, again a leavened bread made from corn(someting like our   roti, but a lot thicker, our roti in arab land and Mediteranean region is larger and is called as Khaboosh) The pita is cut   open, spicy onions,horse radish(the red coloured ones) some lettuce and pita and youghurt are added, this is topped off with   some cream. So this was the sandwhich, pretty  filling as well as tasty.   It was mid morning, and we decided we have to get going. On the map at the tourist office the lady had marked important   places of vist in green, so it was not very difficult to look out. The nearest place was called as Albertina , which is a   opera theatre and today something was going on there, coz we saw lots of people trying to sell us tickets. Later I realised   that and opera was featured there that evening.  So as we walked on we saw many placards on various buildings, where lots of classical music composers of today and the past   lived, the most impressive one was a bakery, which had a board reading that Vivaldi lived there in that alley once.For those   who are not familiar with Vivaldi or the Western Classical music, let me explain what they are, Western Classical music is   the music written for large symphonies or for something called as a String Quartet, (in a string quartet a grou of 4 people   play only stringed instruments like the violins and the violas), or operatic pieces(Operas are dramas performed by actors as   they sing along, generally operas are sun in old latin). Vienna is the melting pot of all the greatest composers, we have   Puccini,Vivaldi,Mozart et al...  Vivaldi was a very famous symphony composer, his work, the four seasons has been played and appreciated at every corner of   the world. I'm sure you too would have heard it, lest recognise it.  We continued our walk, till we came to a point, where a guy was dressed in the old 16th century clothes as a court member, he   was selling tickets to that evenings concert, where they were playing Mozart's pieces(Wish I could have gone). We took a   photograph with him, you can see the photograph on the blog page. He was standing directly in front of Mozart's which was   recently done up. There is a lawn in front of the statue, on which flowers are grown in the shape of a treble clef(A treble   clef is the starting symbol on the sheets of western classical music).I felt elated, so much symbology, mozart is considered   as the statrting point of the new era of classical music.  From there we walked on to the music acaedamy, where music is taught even to this day(I will elucidate my experiences of the   same in a short moment). There was a butterfly garden there in adjoining the building. I had never been to a butterfly garden   in my life, though the entry was expensive I nudged in, the others refrained themselves as it was not of any interest to   them. A myriad number of butterflies were there, of all shades,colours, hues and even sizes.Some of the moths there were   larger than my two palms joined together in open position. Most of the butterflies sat on the orchids, o yes equal number of   varities of orchids were present.A must see place even if it expensive. "
31087,4039381,"27,July,2004",2004-07-27,"   I knew it is going to be a hectic day, we had planned to go to Paris. All this planning would go to waste if we could not get the tickets from the travels we had decided to go by. The travel agents were placed in Karlschrue. Karlschrue, is a small town located south of Heidelberg. It takes about half an hour by train to get there.   Karlschrue, is a wonderful town, it has the old feel to it. All the roads are either cobbled or paved.When we got out of the main station we saw a beggar out there. He was playing the xylophone there, it was beautiful to hear it. By the train station  on the left, there is a tourist information and ticket office. We had to get to Kaiser Strasse(street).We purchased the tickets for the same and took the tram to Kaiser Strasse.   Kaiser Strasse is a huge street(as big as M.G Road from the Trinity circle end to the Cubbon park end).It is a market area, which is located next to the palace. The Kaiser Strasse was built in the memory of Friedrich, the Kaiser(Earl) built many  beautiful fountains in the market area. This market is around 300 years old and I was told that even the flower sellers here are as old as the market. It was a beautiful location. I saw some musicians with a Viola,violin and according playing a folk tune, thought of stopping by but no, no time, it was getting late and I had to get to office too.   Disappointment occured when we went to the office, they had promised us the tickets over the phone but now they said, there were none. So we decided in a moment to go to Vienna.   Nothing much during the day except that the travel to Vienna was great, the country side here consists of fields of wheat which extend for kilometers together, it is the wheat thrushing season now and all you see is the hill slopes down with all green, and the valley for kilometers is filled with yellow wheat. The sun was setting and the moon was nearly up. Time to sleep.Good night. "
31088,4039381,"27,July,2004",2004-07-27,"   Thursday 29th July 2004A normal day as other days, but I would like to describe my way back to the hotel. It might be interesting. Started from office late today at 7:15 PM, there is a road behind our office, which leads into a wood and then to the railway station. Rather than take the normal road to the station, I defnitely prefer this back alley. This is not a asphalted road, but one of mud and loose gravel. The mud in this region of Germany is unlike the one seen in India. In India we are accoustomed to seeing mus/soil red in colour. But in Germany it is brown, with heavy shades of gray in it. The wood behind our office is beautiful, it dark and deep. The vegetation mainly consists of Pine, Maple and White Spruce along with shrubs and vines with red and dark blue berries on them. The road takes a gentle curve from our office to the starting of the woord, the road move south, to the right of which a small meadow of wild flowers are present. Once this is crossed the wood gets pretty dense and thick. The only exception being the road which is used by SAP employees to reach the station. The wood has a small brook too,&nbsp; by now the time was half past seven and the sun still shone like how it shines at 4 in the evening in Bangalore. The temperature was still very enjoyable. The sun filtered itself gracefully through the needly pines and the starred maple leaves to reach the stream, whereafter the stream shimmered like a child playing pranks. Beyond the stream is the dense forests, which looks dark and dense. Please note that dark here does not give a negative feeling to the whole place, rather the foliage here is more darker green in nature than the bright green varities seen elsewhere. Now you know why Black Forest is called so.  I walked rather loosely than my usual pace, as I really was enjoying the flavour of the place. Smelt dank and nice, lots of heather on the exposed roots and the beautiful colour medely of the berries growing on the trunks of trees. As I walked on reached a small bridge which was nearly dilapilated, the bridge has a gentle curve which gives it a rustic look. Walking on I came to fork in the road. From the beginning of this journey I've been reiterating the words of Robert Frost Poems(he is my favourite poet). Now this fork really did it. If anybody has read, ""The Road not Taken"", they will know what I mean. It starts of by, ""Two roads diverged in a yellow wood"". Though this was not a yellow wood I could defnitely relate his words in the autmn season.  A few skylarks sang at the top of their voice. It also had been a long time since I saw sparrows in Bangalore and I could see quite a few here. I stopped for a moment, to look to the top of the trees, they were swaying gently in the wind, I could feel myself trying to synchonise my body movement with them. Just then heard a loud siren,(There is a factory in the middle of all this). Woke myself up from the, what I would call as the Out of body Experience(no connection with the real OBE's). I recited to myself, the last line of Robert Frost's poem ""The woods are lovely dark and deep, but I have miles before I goto sleep, miles before I go to sleep.""(This is from Stopping by the woods on a snowy evening.). Took one more last gentle turn and the station was already in sight, promissing to that lonely road, that I would visit here again, I bid adeiu to the lovely wood till the next time. "
31089,4039381,"27,July,2004",2004-07-27,"   Once again a beautiful day, without the rains. The temperatures seem to be falling down every morning. Though the sun is out, the temperature seems to stay around 15 celsius. Last evening went around Manneim market. The market of Mannheim can be expressed as a small district in itself. shops range from electronics to eateries to bakeries to clothing, not leaving even the skin trade entertainment shops. The market area is called as the ParadePlatz, it is in the center of Mannheim(by the way if I have not written in my earlier chronicles, we stay at Mannheim). The center of the market place stands a water tank, which resembles no traditional water tank. It looks more like a mini bell tower. A magnificient sculpture stands at the very top of the tank.The tank is surrounded by a small square, where lots of varities of flowers, like poppies, honeysuckles and some heather also is grown. The beauty of this whole place is one can sit there for hours doing nothing, yet feel that a lot is accomplished by just staring into the common.  Back to reality, caught an early tram to the train station. The tram here is beautiful, it runs on electricity and has feeling of the old world along with the new. The tram's route from our hotel to the train station is as follows which I will explain in detail. I get in at the Paradeplatz, which I've already explained earlier, the next stop is Schloss, after which comes Universitat, this is the university of Mannheim and is modelled on the Palace of Versilles, the grandiose of the original palace is captured pretty well. All this while we have been travelling north, now the tram turn slowly to the west over a steep grade and viola, we are at the main station of Mannheim(in german railway stations are called as Hauptbanhof pronounced as hopt-ban -hauf). I reach Waldorf, which is a small town an industrial town more appropriately, take a bus to office. In my earlier log, I promised that I would not talk about the office, but I have to make one exception, In the Waldorf office building, we see a great big ball made of granite, about 5 ft in diameter, resting on a thin film of water spary and rotating and rotating about in the clockwise direction. After office, my colleauge Shrikant and I decide to goto Heidelberg which is a university town to check out cameras in the electronic shops there. Though we do not see many electronic shops, we decide to go around the town. We catch a bus from Heidelberg main station to Bismark Platz(Bismark Plaza). This area is town square, and is dedicated to the great leader Bismark, a lovely little park is there with a neo-20th century fountain design, beside which a statue of Bismark exists. I wonder who calls Bangalore and Mysore a garden city, because after looking at Heidelberg all my notions of garden cities in India are abolished. Heidelberg is a university town, it has the old cobbled streets, and the architecture is wonderful. An old castle is there, but we left it for another day. By now it was 8 in the evening and the sun was still brightly shining as it shines at 3 in afternoon in India. We took the train back to Mannheim, and then the tram. We thought we would explore a few more places in the Mannheim market area by continuing in the tram. And that led us to the most interesting part of our Journey. From Mannheim, the tram continued to various places, the views were either the traditional houses with sloping rooves or of corn fields(did I mention that they grow a lot of corn here). We finally reached after an hours Journey to a place called Eindgen, a sleepy little hamlet. I had carried some peaches with me which we bought at the supermarket in Heidelberg(good ones at a low price). We were the only two souls in the station,a beautiful place it was, behind the station towards the west, the sun was still setting and I could see nearly for a mile strtch a field of coronation roses, various colurs, white, pink,red. I could hardly fill my eyes enough with the sight. Next to this field was a huge field of sunflowers, just perfect sight at 9:30 in the night and the sun was yet o set, the whole sky had turned into various shades of orange and pink. the temperature was dropping too, the station indicator read 14 degrees, I wish I could savour the moment for some more time. But shrikant had to break it, a tram cam e by and we misread the board of the tram as a tram to Mannheim and got into it.  The tram instead of travelling to Mannheim travelled to Heidelberg.What are we doing here ? I thought we just visited this place,'alright alright we can take the train back"" I said to myself, but no shrikant wanted to see where this tram takes us. One wonderful thing about the transport system here is that we have a pass which lasts for one month for the Heidelberg region. So travelling will never be a problem for us. So we went on and we reached the Heidelberg market place once again, but this time it was no more a street but the cafe's and restaurants that were there at the side walk poured into the street directly. We hardly had any space to walk. I wish we could sit in one of these places, but the clock showed 10 already. Lots of musicians flock this place for their daily earning. Accordion playes, street performers, String Quartets, piano blues I could hear the whole music shop in here as I passed each cafe. Realising that we have to get back, we caught the tram back which dropped us off at Mannheim at 11:15, tired of the whole travel, I hit the sack early and I here now in the 8 o' clock train I sit to write my journals. Till tommorow then as in german Grusse. "
31090,4039381,"26,July,2004",2004-07-26,"   Monday 26th July 2004 Got up early today, had a good nite sleep though. Took the ealry morning tram to Mannheim station, beautiful weather, no sun and there was a light drizzle. Interesting light effect, the old church sounded its bells and from our hotel window, the sky was lit into the orange shades, which slowly blended into the church walls, beautiful moment, which got me late for my bath. Had a quick bath, then went down for breakfast. A humongous breakfast, with various types of fruits, bread, jams, cornflakes et al..It looked more like a breakfast for kings, shameful that I do not eat this big a breakfast back at home. I wish I had. The weather hadn't picked up, still drizzling there, though a really light drizzle, a comfortable walk to the tram station, from where we could pick up on our way to the railway station.Train journey was&nbsp; a beautiful one, by now the drizzle had stopped and the clouds were slightly clearing up, though sun rays were still meagre. The Journey from Mannheim to St leon Rot(Rot means Red village for whatever reasons), takes about 30 min, the intial part is more on the industrial belt, lots of chemical factories, warehouses for cars etc... can be seen, once we reach Natchse station, the real agricultural belt here begins. Since it is summer here, the wheat was just being thrased for harvesting, it is as we do it bach in India, with huge stone rollers to lay down the wheat onto the earth. The view started to change in a few minutes after that, large expanses of green grassy areas were now visible. The houses here were of the true European countryside styled, where the roofs slant at a pretty steep angle. I guess the reason for this is the snow to slide down once it increases in thickness on top of the roof. The next scenic point was the woods. The woods here are either dark pine or of White Spruce trees, looks beautiful especially when it rains, the train stopped for 30 seconds at a junction and the pine could be seen ,where the water droplets had just settled softly on the thorny pine leaves. Remarkable sight indeed.  The trains in Germany are really beautiful, the pickup is fast indeed due to its running on electricity, apart from it, the design itself is nice, ergonomics of seats, the colour combinations of the interior layout and the design of the whole cabin is well thought out. People here can carry cycles, baby prams, dogs without any problem. (Of course dogs get tickets too). If one wants to extend the journey without getting out at a stop then one can buy the tickets in the compartments itself. Every compartment at the central entrance has a ticket vending machine, the costs are determined from which location you ask the ticket for. The ticket vending machine works on a real time sense system, which gets its live data probably from a GPS tracking system. Interesting stuff.  More country homes passed by a bridge passed by it looked like the song from Chemical Brothers(forgot which one though). Reached Rot a small but beautiful village, got into a bus to get to the office.(Willl not bore you with the office details) Till tommorow then "
31091,4039381,"07,August,2004",2004-08-07,"   Today is the day we leave to Paris, get up early and pack and get ready to go to office. Back in the evening from office,   pick up a few fruits, a packet of grape juice and some chips for the trip, and have a hot bath, i'm all ready for the trip.   Paris the dream city, where I wanted to be atleast once, and now finally is the chance. The bus to Paris takes about 7 hours   and we start from Mannheim at 11 in the night. The bus belongs to a company called as Eurolines. Eurolines travels is not a   single company but a group of companies from all over Europe and Russia, who operate under one name. The german subsidary is   called as deutchshe touring. The bus has plush interiors with really thick headrests, which gives me a feeling that I would   be getting a good amount of sleep. And off we start.  Saturday 7th August 2004: We reach the outskirts of paris in the wee morning hours, there are a couple of stops at Paris Disneyland hotels to drop them   off. It is a beautiful place, though I did not see the actual place, I could see only the hotel area, it made me feel that I   should be there back at least once.  The bus drops us at the east end of Paris and the first impression I get of the city is ""My God there are lots of Afro people   here"".Paris has the largest population of blacks(Afro) people in Europe, they constitute to around 15% of the population in   Paris. We ask for directions to get out of there to our hotel in Pastuer(named after Louis Pastuer, who invented the   pastuerisation process to make milk safe). They lead us to the metro station and say that the person there would help us. We   tell him the place that we have to go to and he gives us a ticket and says you have to catch Line 6. A maze of corridors   leads us to the railway platform, and we see no line 6, but line 3. We were totally confused, we asked people there and they   said something in French saying catch Line 3 and get to some other station but we were not too sure what the station was. So   we decided to have a look at the map of the subway. Every station has a huge map of the subway, we were looking at the map,   and an elderly gentleman asked whether we required some help, again in french, but we did not understand what he was saying,   and then he politely asked in french whether we spoke frebch, this was one of the sentences, I had learnt and I answered back   saying no and thank you for his help. Finally we figured that we have to travel quite a distance change 3 trains to get to   our place.   The hotel which we had chosen was very close to the Eiffel Tower, atleast that is what it said in the internet page of the   hotel.   Paris has a huge metro system. it is 104 years and opened in 1899,it is about 200 km in length, within the city itself. It's   stations are a huge maze of corridors,, with lots of direction symbols, which if you ddo not follow you are bound to get   lost. The metro here transports roughly 6 million people per day across the city.It is an extremely pld system but extremely   efficient too. The train cars are old on the older roots, with mechanical doors, it is and old world charm there. the   stations too are old and a lot of hoardings carry the cultural life of the city.  The stations are named after famous personalities generally as the areas also carry the name. It was a beautiful system,   though very old and smutty.  Our station came  pretty soon, we got off and we walked out of the subway into the street in search of Boulevard Pastuer. It   was the downtown area of paris and looked like any other downtown area in the world. Our hotel named Innova, stood at the   corner of the street, and old building, which gave me shivers initially, but once we entered in we saw the old oriental   carpets and tapestries, which brought some hope, showing that the hotel was good. Since we were early, our room was not   ready, but the guy at the desk was kind enough to let us keep our luggage in a back room.  We decided to have breakfast and visit atleast one location before actually checking into the hotel. After a short wash, we   were on our way to find a place for breakfast. The air was good and temperature not too high, we walked along tree lined   avenues and found all the cafes spilling itself onto the sidewalks. The cafes here generally have a menu card outside with   prices on it, which made us feel comfortable,as to checking the prices before walking in. Paris is a notorious place for its   prices on the food. A small cafe can chanrge for a simple vegetable sandwich anything between 3EUR to 35 EUr, mind you the   cafe charging 35 EUr look the same as the cheap one.  We went to the metro station to buy a pass for 2 days for major landmarks. A ticket here in the metro does not cost too much   even if the place is expensive. For the whole of Paris it costed us just 13 EUR for 2 days. 200 km of track for 13 EUR is a   really a good deal.A map of the city, with major landmarks and a map of the metro, interlaced with the major landmarks was   given to us. This proved to be very helpful. In big cities like Paris, to visit places a map is a must and one that comes   free is even better.  We decided to go to the louvre museum, where Mona Lisa has been staged, and other works of art are present. We caught the   train and in a short while we were at the louvre station. Coming out of the subway a grand building, with intricate works of   art, was stainding before us. Again without asking for any directions, by just looking at the boards, we could figure out   where the museum entrance was. Before actually entering the museum we decided to have breakfast. Our food choice being   limited to vegetarian cuisine made me feel that good food is a rarity here, but again the city srung a surprise on me. After   checking quite a few menu cards of cafes we decided to get into one where the sandwich in french was described having   tomatoes, olives and cheese, yummy for a growling tummy.  A typical french cafe, proudly displaying its passiteries(of course the expensive cost card next to it) and blue jazz playing   even in the early hours of the morning. We ordered what we had decided by pointing fingers on the menu.  The french are known for their good cooking everybody knows, but I thought they were only good at meaty dishes, but lo a   surprise held me when the sandwich came by, soft french bread, with miles of cheese, mixed with a good portion of herbs(   rosemary, thyme, basil,oregano), sundried tomatoes, to top off with raw black olives, a heavanly smell and sight.This sounds   like the garlic bread with cheese we get in pizza hut in India, yes it is something like that but a lot more larger, to fit   in one large plate. We dug into it like hungry pigs, afterall we were in gaul. In 5 min the food was off the plate, without   any grace ofcourse.Being ravenous in france is a good thing, trust me the variety of food one gets there is enough to keep   the tounge wet for a lifetime. al  The next stop was Louvre museum, at the entrance of the museum there exists a glass pyramid which was created by the famed   chinese-american architect Ieoh ming pei.This was taken up as the mordernization project of the louvre. The museum has a 200   year old history behind it. It was present from the time of louis the XIV, the king of France, it served as a gallarie for   the paintings and works of art which were presented to the king.  Now currently the Louvre is designed into 7 section based on timelined periods, which are  a)Oriental Architecture consisting of the Assyrians, Babylonians,Mesopotamians, the Ming dynasties and ofcourse the Indus   valley civilization.  b)Islamic Architecture: This consists of the architecture from Persia and the arabic and turkish influences c) Egyptian: this is one of  the largest collections in the Louvre, consists of sarcophacus of original mummies. d) Greek and Roman: Exquisite statues of marble, genrally depicitng human anatomy. e) Painting section:This section has supposedly over 6000 paintings, which are divided by period wise. f) Arts and civilization from Africa and Ocenacia:Don't know much about this as had no time to visit the place. g) Prints and drawings  So we entered the glass pyramid and reached basement level 1, where the tickets were sold. Bought tickets and a map of the   museum, and entered into the greek and roman section. Audio listening devices were being handed out for a fee of 5 EUR, but   we opted out of it. Continued into the gallery and I dropped my jaw looking at the number of statues of marble placed there.   The gallery for the Greek and Roman civilization is huge. The only drawback of louvre is that though it is a museum of   international standard, there are no plates which explain the sculpture or painting in English, everything is in French. We   were lost in the myriad number of sculptures that were there and took quite a few pictures.  Before we realised, it was 2 hours since we had entered the section of Greek and Roman culture and we were just entering the   section to the oriental artifacts, we realised at this rate we cannot even cover one-third of the whole museum, so we decided   to see the main sections, i.e.. the Egyptian and the most visited painting the Mona Lisa and then if we had time, we could   visit the other parts. So a rush through the egyptian section with lots of sarcaphocus and other artifacts, could not stop   for a long time.  Walked into the largest gallery I've ever seen, it must have been atleast a 100m long,this whole section is filled with   paintings of every era concievable.We ignored most of the paintings and walked down into the place where mona lisa was   placed.First impressions of the painting, it is rather small, when you compare some of the canvases that I saw in the gallery   which we just walked from, the size is puny.Secondly, the colours of the canvas are not so bright, it might have been because   of the low light conditions, but apart from it,it was pretty dark. thirdly, nothing impressive about the painting itself,   just another painting when compared to the ones in the gallery which were marvellous works of art.Fourthly, this is my   personal opinion, the painting must been a good replica of the original one. The reason I say this is lots of people were   clicking away photographs on the painting. It is believed that over exposure to flashes, a painting will peel away slowly   over a period time.So personal opinion,the real Mona Lisa must be safe in the vaults of the louvre.  We got out of the museum after a short while, and caught a train back to the hotel. Checked into the hotel and had a nice   long nap.  Finally it was time to go to Eiffel Tower. The Eiffel was just 2 train stops away form our hotel. Getting out of the Subway,   only the top of the Eiffel could be seen in close proximity.Walking down the street led us to the structure itself. A   magnificent structue, I can say with its broad base. We took lots of photographs from the lower half. There was a long queue   to go to the top of the structure, so we got into it. It cost 10.5 EUR to go to the top of the Eiffel, but it is worth all   that. There are 3 levels on the Eiffel tower, the first level is the lowest and the broadest one, here the view of the city   is good, but not too good too.   From the second level, the view was magnificent, that is where you see all the photographs from. It is one of the most   romantic places in the world. Defnitely worth all the pain of standing in the queue and the ticket cost itself. We stopped   for a little while there at the Eiffel, with a large Coke to savour the splendour of the city.  When on the second level, the sparkle show of the Eiffel started, the lights on the structure were already on. They had a   mellow colour, but gave a bright effect to the structure.The sparkle show happens every once in 30 min, there are a set of   running lights along the length of the Eiffel, which switch ono and off randomly. These lights are bright like a mercury   vapur lamp, and the whole structure looks like it has an effect of somebody dropping shining stars onto the yellow structure,   just sheer ingenuity of the keepers of Eiffel to sell the place this way.  We were at the top, in a short while, the view of the city was magnificent, we spent some more time on the top of Eiffel, and   then decided to walk down. It was denitely a long way down. At the bottom of Eiffel, there are these sellers of souveiniers   of the Eiffel bought a few, a few more photographs, by then we realised it was nearly midnight, so had to leave. "
31092,4039381,"04,August,2004",2004-08-04,"   Wednesday 04th August 2004 I've have to write this experience by delaying the Vienna details, as this was just an evening which was interesting. It all started when our mentor suggested that he takes us out. The whole talk started due to the fact that, I wanted to eat the traditional dish of Germany called as Flumcoghan. Flumcoghan is a kind of a traditional pizza specific to the south of Germany. It is made of a thin crust and some topping on it.   Anyway,last evening was the time when he had proposed we go over to the french border to a small villae, have the Flumcoghan, a few drinks and back. It turned out to be a really interesting evening.   We started from our office in Rot Malsch at 5 in the evening, starting to travel south westerly. An interetsting landscape, where lots of apple and pear orchards could be seen. The highway was beautiful. Initially it was a long straight road and then the road started to wind. On either sides you could see dense forests of pine, where special roads were laid(not of asphalt or concrete but plain simple country roads flattened) for cycling around. Our mentor Karl, who is from Cologne originally has biked around these areas quite a lot on Saturday afternoons. The whole place was serene and calm, suddenly on the horizon we could see a small roundabout, around which one of the tiny roads led to a small village. This village, the name of which even out mentor was not too sure off, lies at the border of france and germany. 500 m away we could see the french border, a house stood exactly on the line, I pity the guy who owns the house, he has to pay taxes to the french as well as the german authorities.   We exited the village shortly and got back on to the highway. The place Karl was taking us is called Weisenbaum.A literal translation means White Castle. On the french side everything changed, the shape of houses especially. te houses here are made from pine beams, trying to hold up the earth and straw walls. This kind of construction was prevalant in this region during the 17 and the 18th century and still the houses stand up to this. The houses have french windows and the insides can be meagerly seen as the windows are covered by lace curtains. Some of the house interiors could be seen, they were tastefully decorated.   All streets in the village was cobbled, no aspalt used. The roads are extremely narrow, if one car passes the other has to wait. We walked down the narrow road and eventually came to a small river(I cannot call it a stream as the force of water seemed to be pretty good). The river flowed next to the road, and had the same width as that of the road. It had a lot of bridges, small ones. Some houses were actually built over the stream so you always had a bubbling sound if you lived in one of these houses. As a novelty one these houses were even converted into a restaurant.   Further down the road, we came to the local government office, and imposing structure built of Sandstone. This is the main square of the city, again which was extremely small. A small roundabout is there, which divreges into 3 roads in different directions, one of along which we had walked. on the left we saw an imposing church. Karl suggested we walk into the church, if it is open. It was already 6:45. The church too was made of red standstone, this church was supposedly built by granite during the 14th and 15th century, the broken down during the 17 century, then rebuilt in sandstone , again a part of the church was bombed during the second world war, now it rests in peace as a part ruin and part as a functioning church. There existed a large passage, where gravestones of the existing abbots of the church were kept as a mark of respect. Their coffins were there too. I wish I could take a peek inside the church, but as it was past 6, it was closed. In this small village everything closes by 6 except ofcourse the cafes. In Germany everything must close by 8 as this is the law, the law states that everything must open and close by Christian timings in Germany.  We walked out of the church and decided to just hang around the village for sometime, before actually going and having something for our growling tummies.Every house in the village has some fruit tree or the other. We stole some plums from the church courtyard trees and had them, though they were not fully ripe they tasted good.   After a while, we were at a local cafe/pub, as I had described earlier, we were here to eat the Flumcoghan. Karl suggested that we take a Flumcoghan which was made of apples, and apple wine was poured and the whole dish is flamed with a gas burner to burn the alcohol and the apples. This is topped off with cinnamon and some non spicy spices powder to add more taste.   The flaming process was a nice one to see. The base of the flumcoghan itself is very thin and crusty, over which a coniderable portion of white sour cream is spread, then a layer of apples and then the apple wine, which is pretty heavy on alcohol content is poured and the whole dish is burned, with a gas flame.(For those who did not understand this, the gas flame is generated and the flame is moved over the dish. Due to the wine, the whole dish catches fire, with a blue flame and then the flame is put off.)  Flumcoghan of this type(the apple variety) is generally taken as a desert. The normal Flumcoghan consists of onion and bacon, which is baked in the oven. By the way I forgot to tell you, the apple one too is baked before the flaming process is done. Karl asked what we would like to drink and we said what is the speciality of the area, he asked the waitress for the same and she emphatically answeres ""RICARD""(pronounced as ree-card), we all thought ""RICARD"" was a brand name for an alcoholic drink, but no, it is a traditional alcoholic drink. The drink is made from apple wine(the one used on flumcoghan too, apple is a very common fruit used here, it is called as pomme on the french side and apfel on the german side). It also consists of anise juice. At first like you I wondered what anise is, then when the drink came by and I smelt it for the first time, it smelt familiar, I kept my mind racing as to where I had smelt this before, Karl suggested we add water, this makes the anise juice cloudy and a nice taste too. Well the first gulp, I recognised anise as our traditional Saunf.The drink was heavenly wonderful, though it consisted strong alcohol, the flavour was smooth and the body of the drink even more smoother. This drink is not packaged or available in supermarkets, only in this one single village of Weisenbaum.   We had our Flumcoghan and ricard and Karl suggested that we drive back home on a different route, where vineyards were located.My ears pricked on the word vineyard. He even suggested we stop at a local farmhouse and taste their wine as it was a speciality as it is not a mechanised process in that farmhouse. The farmhouse had its own vineyard and its own cafe/pub.They made their own food, out of their very own produce, that is their own pigs, sheep, cows for beef and milk etc.. Unfortunately no vegetarian food was available.   The cafe itself was located in the old house, and spilt itself into the courtyard. The courtyard had a myriad number of trees and bushes, some of which were walnut,figs, oleander, rose bushes, and some wild flowers. Ofcourse grape wines were seen a few for decorationn purposes, not for harvesting. The vineyards were located behind the house on a gentle south slope of the hill,where the sun is not too strong. The cafe here is famous for its produce of dry white and red wines. For those who are not familiar about dry and sweet wines, in simple terms, dry wines are stronger than the sweet ones. They are available both for red as well as white. White wine is not made from white grapes, but is made from the red grapes itself, without the skin, which has the tannin which give an acrid flavour and a stronger body to the wine.  Since it was a warm evening we decided we'll go for a bottle of sweet white wine, I would have personally preferred, dry, but since a lady was there too we thought sweet was the right option. The bottle did not cost much, it came to about 8 EUR. The bottle was opened and the bubbly let in, this not Chardonnay, Chardonnay white is a very light drink for any occasion. This variety was called Reislinger White. It was of the vintage of 2001. Nice wine too.   The whole environment was charged as many people were there(already drunk). All I can say is the wine was too good.Evening was better and I'm off to bed. "
31093,4039381,"03,August,2004",2004-08-03,"   Saturday 31st July 2004  Part 1 What a wonderful morning, last night in the bus we passed through, Sttutgart and Munich in the dark, so could not make much of the city, today morning, the austrian valley was filled with mist. The tall grass lands now seemed covered with grey mist. We reached Vienna at 9 and had a wash.  Vienna. the first impression of the city is that it is very old, and like any other tourist destination, it is slightly dirty(not as much as India  is). The city of vienna is divided into various quarters as per the location of the various monuments. Vienna has the museum quarter, the palace quarter and the cathedral and the market quarter just to name a few. We got into the main train station called as Westbanhauf, obviously in the west end of the city. Here we took a day's pass for the underground. The underground is the blood line of Vienna,it has 4 major lines called as U1,U2,U3 and U4 and also integrated with the surface, bus,tram and trains. The cheapest and the fastest way to get around Vienna is the subway. The subway here is an old system that was developed during the 70's and yet the system is a beautiful one.   The cost of a ticket for one day to use the subway all lines is only 5 Euros. This is dirt cheap even when converted into Rs. The entrance to the subway was a grand one, 4 escalators, 2 of which were going down and the other 2 coming up. The escalators took us to a depth of around 20 m from the surface level. This was just line 1 and 2. Line 3(U3) which we were supposed to catch to get to the Tourist information office was in the next level. So in short at a level of 20 m below the surface, there exists railway lines for the first level, after another 20 meters,, another railway line exists.  The trains go extremely fast as there is no other traffic, some people might feel claustrophobic, but at the moment I was enjoying the ride. The subway walls are just centimeters away from the window and the train accelarated to atleast 130 KMPH and reduces and brakes.  We get out at a stop called as Stephen's Plaza. We walk upstairs and voila I saw the biggest cathedral, Ive ever seen in my life. We forgot going to the tourist information center and walked into the cathedral. The red-marble sepulcher of Emperor Frederick III, sculpted from 1467 to 1513 by Niclas Gerhaert van Leyden; the pulpit, a work from 1514-15 by Anton Pilgram (who put his own relief portrait underneath it as his signature); the Altarpiece of Wiener Neustadt (Wiener NeustÃ¤dter Altar), a Gothic winged altar from 1447 - and the tomb of Prince Eugene of Savoy, dating from 1754.  The columns of the cathedral were carved with various scenes from the Bible. The altar and the pulpit were exquisite works of art. Sunlight filtered majestically from the stained glass windows on to the altar directly on the the cross of Jesus. For a moment my breath was caught within me. The magical moment was when I turned mu head upwards and saw the old pipe organ aside which were the frescos done in the traditional italian style. Magnifico, all the time though being inside the church walls, all I could do was swear saying ""Jeez"".  We took a bundle of photographs, clicking in every direction possible.   Finally walked out of the cathedral after 30 min in there. Still the memories of the sculptures, the columns and the altar, very fresh even to this moment.   The cathedral has a large courtyard, which directly spills onto the main market street of Vienna. We walked up the market street, this is a large cobbled street, where cafes and sitting areas are in the center of the street, with various shops lined to the side. "
2403,4040811,"30,July,2004",2004-07-30,"    Hello,  First here is some information:  1.)I am in the process of trying to get some pictures up here but it is difficult; my computer does not want to cooperate. But I am trying so hopefully pics to come!  2.)Also for all of those who do not know this Sunday is the Alpha Marchdown. It is the biggest stepshow in St. Louis. Other Greeks have tried to hold a show, but none have been as successful as this. It is always a great show. We are the reigning champs! That's right Blue and White Sweep last year and this year to big baby! All of this is to say if you have nothing better to do and are in the St. Louis area check it out. Heck if you are out of town..ROAD TRIP! Tickets are on sale at From One Greek To Another on Delmar and they sell them at the door. My advice is to just get the VIP ticket. It includes the show, dinner and the after party. The whole event takes place on the campus of University of Missouri-St. Louis (which is my alma mater shout out to UMSL). If you need more info go to my profile and email me:)  3.)I have recieved feedback that when you try to comment on the page it tries to make you sign up to have your own blog page! Sorry it does that but to bypass all of that just leave a message anonymously and put your name in the body of your post! You can still just always go to my profile and email me...  Now to the real deal,  So my last detailed post was about the club. In which post I stated that I was going to stay out of the club circuit for about six months. (about the needed healing time) Well this morning I heard an advertisment about grown folks Friday at Spruills. It is 23 and up! What! No young bucks in Air Force Ones! We might have something here. So one day I will go there. Not today though because it is raining. The next time I go anywhere it has to be clear and sunny skies.  The funny thing about Spruills is that it is a banquet hall. When did the banquet hall turn into the club? Some of us know how to pull a hustle... During the day it is Rolanda's beauty salon but at 8pm it becomes the new concert venue!  The last time I was at Spruills I was, oh about 16 years old and I was there for my ROTC military banquet! This is just too ironic for me.  So if you have ever been to Spruills let me know...Is it even worth the gas that I will burn to get there?  God Bless, Raquel   "
2404,4040811,"27,July,2004",2004-07-27,"    I have gotten a lot of feedback on my post, Where the heck am I, but I have yet to get a comment here. Leave your comments here or, email them to me. I will ask for permission to post them then I will post them right here for everyone to read! Exciting I know!   Now my co-worker Alandrea went to the club last week with me as well and also had quite an experience. She valet her car at&nbsp;the club because we got the hook up on it.  (Hook-up: can be a noun or verb-to get free or get a discount on. In this case it was free)  I could have gotten&nbsp;valet but I had already parked and just decided to forget it because my friend and I parked right around the corner.   So when Al decides to leave, the guy who valet her car could not find her keys! He pulled a whole bunch of keys out of his pocket and asked her which keys belonged to her. She ended up having to go outside in the rain to help him look for them. Now I will admit that I do not know a lot about valet but from what I see on TV there should be a box, a cabinet of sort, to house the keys that you have acquired. Your pocket, not very professional.   We need to improve people, we need to improve.   God Bless,  Raquel   "
2405,4040811,"26,July,2004",2004-07-26,"    Ok,   So now for my second post I will get to it. I will get the party started like the Black Eye Peas. I will talk about a subject that I have expressed to a few of my friends in St. Louis and we all agree.   When did the club life in ST. LOUIS MO turn in to New York.   I mean come on. I know we trying to come up but my Goodness! This is getting out of hand and needs to be addressed.   Let me just tell you about how I remember club life: (note: never a big clubber per say, but I did attend a few B.C.* when I turned 18 and thought I was too grown)&nbsp;&nbsp;  9:00am decide that I am going to go to the club with the girls  12:00 noon: go to mall to get outfit or get matching pieces to items that I already own&nbsp;in an attempt to make something funky happen. I have generally seen this outfit in my mind and now I will try to bring it to life.  6:00 pm go to sleep  9:00 pm wake up and prepare for the club by showering, doing hair, makeup, and purse change (can be done in car if your are running out of time)  10:30pm leave for the club or friends house if I am driving  11:00-11:15pm arrive at club  Now pay close attention here:  After arrival at the club I exit vehicle and walk to the door. Show my ID go to the cashier, pay and go into the club and commence getting my party on!   Clubs in 2004 post Nelly, post Chingy, have gotten out of control! These club owners and bouncers think they are God or something and tend to treat you how the hell ever.   Now when you go to the club, you can get to the club after 10:30 if you bad, but you will be waiting in line. I ABSOLUTELY HATE LINES AT THE CLUB. This comes from a bad experience on my friend Candice's birthday where we waited in line&nbsp;FOR ONE HOUR and did not get in!&nbsp;I did not get dressed up in heals to stand outside, sometimes in the rain. Oh no! You got me confused with that other girl over there. Call me stuck up if ya want to! I am just stating my opinion.   Ok, let me calm down. But last week was the worst.  I go to the club right. I have to get there at 10pm-10:15 to avoid the line. Even if you get there and there is no line that make you stand there like Boo boo the fool just because they can. Then they let you in but you are there all extra early and then the music don't get right until about 12:00. I don't drink anymore so I usually just sit there with a water and look at what people have on.   My second issue with the club is how crazy crowded it is! It is scary&nbsp;crowded.&nbsp;It is if&nbsp;some dropped a cigarette we would all die crowded because no one would have a prayer of making it to the exit. Quit letting all these people in! If you want all those people in here expand, open the back door to the alley or&nbsp;something! I go to the club to dance, I have no room to do it, I paid to get in, and&nbsp;I am not a satisfied customer.   Let me speak to the manager.....  Hello. Because I did not have adequate room to shake my behind, I need a refund.   Then when I am ready to leave, it is pouring down rain.&nbsp;Now there are all these bouncers at the door and they all have umbrellas but are not offering to escort anyone to the car! SO I got completely drenched so much so I had to wash my hair. It looked like I had been the shower. I was SO not happy.   Well that is it for me and the club for I would guess somewhere around another six months. It will take a while to forget about this one. I think I will be hanging out at the A's: AMC and AMF.   Thank you for allowing me to vent, more stories about my three times to the club this month to come!   God Bless,  Raquel   * B.C. stands for Before Christ was a big part of my life.   "
2406,4040811,"26,July,2004",2004-07-26,"    Well!&nbsp;&nbsp;To all of you I say welcome to my world!   To all that don't know me my name is Raquel. I am a 23 year old college graduate currently residing in St. Louis Missouri.   University of Missouri-St. Louis!   I am also a proud member of Zeta Phi Beta Sorority Inc!   I have to state why I finally decided to do this:   Well I read a lot of these things and I find the stories absolutely hilarious. I question myself am I witty and creative enough to maintain something like this? Is my life exciting enough? Do people give a care what I think about things in the world? Well there is only one way to find out.   Please feel free to comment on any post you chose. I welcome all suggestions and opinions!   I think that this is enough for one post, expect another latter today or tomorrow!   God Bless,  Raquel   "
2407,4040811,"11,August,2004",2004-08-11,"    Hello Everybody, I have to take this time to issue a disclaimer:  In this here post I will make many comments towards men that may be construed as a little angry. I am not a bitter Black woman; this post is meant for entertainment purposes and not to offend anyone. Reading this post may cause women to yell ""thatâ€™s right"" and ""uh huh girl, you better say that"". It also may cause men to feel picked on or targeted. Please read w/caution.   Now maybe about a week ago I ran into one of my old boyfriends. I don't even know if you can call it boyfriend or girlfriend given that I was all of 13 years old in the eight grade at the time. The relationship lasted exactly one week. I found out he was cheating on me so I started this rumor that I was talking to someone else too so he would break up with me. I used to have a serious problem with breaking up with people so I would do things to get them to dump me. I know, I needed professional help, I know. So after this break up, we just went back to being friends.  So I had not saw this guy for about 3 years or so until about a week ago. I am sitting on my porch talking to my boy Justin (Hi Justin!) on the phone and he walks up and says Raquel? Now it is pretty dark out at this time so I say, ""Who is that dar?"" And he says his name and I get off the phone and give him a hug. He is like, ""dang you look good, and you lost weight?"" He then bends over to tie his shoe and says, ""Dang you got some pretty feet."" So I am like ok, you are quite the little charmer. Not that I did not like it; every girl likes a compliment... several is a bonus. So he asked me if I was single and I said yes, and he asked could he call me and I was like cool, and I gave him my number.  He called me about a week latter and was like can I come over. I said cool. Now when it is someone coming over and I don't have to leave the house, I don't put on clothes until they get there. So I eventually fall asleep and he never shows up.  So maybe a couple days after that he calls and is like can I come over tonight I am sorry about last night. I say cool and eventually fall asleep and he never shows.  So last Monday he calls and says sorry I have been busy, In the studio (I won't even get into this), can I come over latter and bring you a CD, I say cool and end up leaving to go somewhere and he never showed because he never called.  So last night, he calls when I am on my way from Bible study and was likeâ€ Where you at""...""I am in the car"".....""Where in the car"".....""on 367"".....""Oh man I am at your house now"".....""Well wait, I will be there in about 10 minutes"".....""I can't I be on the move man! I have a stop to make a run in Berkley and I will be right back"".... I start to laugh and say sure. Of course he never called back.  Now Even though I could care less what he does, one phrase did kind of make me upset. ""I be on the move man! What the heck is that? Like I am not on the move. I have a job, a workout schedule, a church I attend regularly on Sunday and during the week, plus family, friends, sorority business, etc. Now if I can be where I say I am going to be when I say I am going to be there, surly you who has no job, church, sorority, workout schedule, just family and friends can be there. I am just telling it like it TI is.  MEN, yes I am talking to some of you, wants us to always understand. But you don't understand. We have lives too. I know it might not seem like it because we answer the phone when you call and do things like come over your house to visit, when you want us to, when we are dead tired. Because we are available to take you to work when your car is down, there to rub your back when you are sick, angry and frustrated and accompany you to parties, family reunions, funerals, and always manage to look great on your arm. You want to know why we do this men, because when we care about you, WE MAKE YOU A PRIORITY IN OUR LIVES. Thatâ€™s right! We move you to the top of the list. All I am asking for is the same treatment that you expect...thatâ€™s all.  All I am saying is think about it. Do you right now, and this can go for men and women, have someone who just thinks you are the cats meow and you play them to the left and off the cliff?Shame isn't it.  SO then I am talking to my friend Justin again about this and I said"" I am not really worried about it because it is not like I could ever have a relationship w/ dude we are on two different pages. He would only be good for talking to, hearing him compliment me and rub my feet."" He made it sound like I was wrong. What do you think people based on what I have told you about him? Let me know if I am evil.  God Bless Raquel   "
2408,4040811,"03,August,2004",2004-08-03,"    Hello All!  Yes, Yes We won again. The Zeta Ladies are just BADDDD! Oh my goodness! No Blue and White Sweep though, the Sigmas did not win, but I am still ecstatic about my sorors though. Just beware that this is going to be a long post, but very very entertaining:)  So, this years show was by far the best show that I have been to, and I counted this week and this is my 6th year going! I am getting so old. Everyone stepped except for the Omega's which kind of shocked me because they always step. The Sigma Gamma Rho's opened the show. They had a 70's... old school theme, you get the picture. They had a good show, very high energy and very difficult steps. They did really well.  Then it was time for the main event! Here is what the people came to see! Ha Ha! (In case you do not know me, I talk much trash about sports, my sorority, my church, just about anything I am passionate about.) Our theme was a court case. Pure genius if you ask me. It started with a powerpoint show where it stated that the ladies of Zeta Phi Beta Sorority, Inc. have been accused of theft of stepshows and strolls, something we deny and tonight, you will be the judge. Then the powerpoint introduced the judge and the prosecutor Ivy D. Poodle. Then it introduced us. I can't even remember the song that we came out on but it was hype! I was so excited! I was in the VIP section with a whole lot of sorors and we were screaming! It was great. There show was so hot, not one mistake, steps were difficult, they held the theme the entire show and it made it interesting. I was so proud.  Then it was the Delta's turn. Now at first I was a little frightened because it was like 30 of them stepping and they came out hype too. But then they had no theme they were just out there doing there thing. It got kind of old to look at. They wore casual boots w/no heel or tap so it made their steps sound too clunky and not precise and crisp. At the end I was no longer worried:)  The AKA's, well again they came out hype. They had no theme as well, made about two or three mistakes....We had this puppy in the bag! I knew we won by the intermission. No need to even wait on the judges.  Now here is why I think that we always win. WE ALWAYS HAVE A THEME. A theme is essential to keeping your show interesting. Stepshows are about entertainment, and a plot of some kind entertains. It shows creativity and that you put in a lot of effort. Anyone can put a step together and perform it but, to come up with a theme, get clothes, costumes and props to fit your theme, takes effort and work. Plus your want to maximize all your point categories and those creativity and originality points can go a long way. If you have a theme you have to carry it through the whole show. You can't just have an intro theme; it will make your show start out hot but get cold at the end like so many other shows did.  The men I will sum up here: The Kappa's won, there show was good. The Iota's stepped they did this step with knives and two of the guys threw the knives out at the judges instead of down and one of the knives hit the Delta judge. (She was not injured though)  Now during the show I sat on the 1st row of the balcony in the center (I got there an hour early for those seats). I sat with my friend Candice and her sister Sydney. I was also next to my former protege Kenyatta on my left. At the intermission people started to sit in other peoples seats. So these 3 girls sat in Kenyatta and her friends seats and refused to move. The Alphas tried to be nice but she refused to move. We told her that those seats were taken but she sat there anyway. That kind of thing makes me so mad. I know I should not care, no one was crazy enough to sit in my seat, but I just hate ignorant people! If you get there half way though the show, you need to sit in the back at the top, behind that pole. These people are crazy these days, I guess morals are out the window.  The afterparty was cool, I had fun. I stayed till about 1am and I was off to the bed!  All in all, one of the best dang marchdowns period.  God Bless, Raquel  p.s. I will post latter about what people had on. That deserves special attention.   "
29620,4042056,"27,July,2004",2004-07-27,   Hoorah. I like when quizzes are pretty accurate like this one.
29621,4042056,"26,July,2004",2004-07-26,"   Here are some updates on the main players in my life just because I can do this here without anyone ever reading/judging:  Emily B:   Well, after she stopped going to school altogether I realized that she's taken it all wayyy to far. So what, you have problems like everyone else! Grow up and deal with them and get off your 12 medications. We're all depressed, that's why we're human. Seriously, it's all in herhead! Gah! I wish i could just yell at her and make her realize this!  Taylor S:   Blah, always up and down. Love and hate. Whatever. I care so much, but I also have seen how fucked up our relationship can be, so I really and getting tired of investing my emotional happiness in it. I tried to give my all, and it wasn't enough for him. He's screwed me over one too many times so now I just expect the bullshit and think, whatever, it's supposed to be superficial anyways because he's leaving. So although part of me still wishes more than anything that he'd be the one, I realize he doesn't act like it, and if he is, it's a real pity. But I still love him, so there's no sense ending it now, I'll wait it out.  Nicole P:   Wow... we used to be such good friends, and now we're just not! Seriously, it's like the friendship justdied. Yesterday was warped tour and that was great to spend the day with her and colin, but it's the first time all summer. And I don't think it's possible to ever see her without colin. I mean it's cute, theyre in love. But isn't this the exact same thing she's done with all the other boyfriends? Oh yes, that's right, it is. But I do wish we were still close. Although there are some big problems I have with her, I still love her and she's one of my good friends, so i don't want to lose it completely. We'll see what happens.  Jamie S.:   Another former close friend. We were realllly close and then I became closer with brendan (who i lost for the most part as well) and things got bad with my mom and I got depressed and he did his whole ""friendship test"" thing, and it was lost i guess. I didn't mean for us to drift, but at the end of the year, it just kinda happened. Since then I've talked to him and hung out with him, but I'm unsure about our friendship... how genuine it is. But last time I talked to him, he seemed to have forgotten that he hated me, or something. So that's good I think, perhaps I can pretend we never stopped being friends? I'll try, because I really need all the friends I can get.  Parents: My mom and I are finally starting to be normal again. After all the drama and such we both realized it works better to back off and just say whatever. But we do have some bad times still, which atre pretty bad. I dont think i'll ever forgive some of the stuff she said and did. She was more hurtful than she could know.  And as far as my dad- havent talked to him in months. Which i suppose is good. Probably for the best since it would just be bad times with him too. I just want to get away from them. Come to think of it, I want to get away from most everyone... I just want a break from life.   "
29622,4042056,"26,July,2004",2004-07-26,"   (Another journal entry transferred. I had only written in it a couple times.)   mm, writing in this thing again? Well I mean I only took a year off (minus one day)... So anyways, wow, I'm still with Taylor so that's pretty sweet. Though somne things are aggrevating. I love him, but gras! So he's been gone (like last summer) since july 1st, in CO. It's a good opportunity and experience and such for him but it's really annoying for me. We talk on the phone when we can, but it's really not enough. We're both lonely and get depressed and it's just stupid. Last night he cut himself for the first time. What a little hypocrite. All the time explaining how it's against him etc. to do that. He's like the reason I stopped. And now he starts. Fuck that- it makes my counting on his strength and using that as inspiration and such worthless. Well whatever, I'm better than that. I'm better than the people who need that. I can stop whenever I want, thant's another reason I did stop, I don't want to put myself in the same category as the pathetic souls who ""need to hurt themselves to distract from the pain of life."" Bah. I realized- deal with it! Life sucks, whatever, get used to it dammit. And although on occasion I have a sort of slip (like in a fight with someone I scratch myself, etc.) I still have grown up enough to deal with sadness in other ways. Stupid taylor. I mean I know what he was feeling, last week I had a little breakdown of sorts myself. I just needed to talk to him, but the thing was, he wasnt there for me. I tried so hard to be there for him, console him, etc. but it seemed as if he didn't want me to try to help or reassure him of my love, so im not sure what to do. I'm kind of pissed off about he's handled this being away thing. Not calling really, not being very considerate, etc. I do love him, but I guess this is one of the reasons it's good we're breaking up next year. Maybe someday I'll find someone who really treats me like a goddess. I'm so shallow because I basically want a guy like Jon Woodside, but one who's more attractive. He 's so good to me, but he's justnot my type physically, so i guess that's the way it goes. Tay is fun, but he's definitely not my dream guy. He's hot, he's fun, and he can be sweet, but he doesn't sweep me off my feet. He doesn't make me feel like I'm a queen. He does do some nice things sometimes.... and sometimes he compliments me.... but I always feel like Im being judged. And when I ask if he thinks I'm pretty and he says ""well, i think you could use a diet."" then I feel pretty bad abouit myself. I suppose I should, he is telling the truth, but still, I do wish he didn't think that. I wish he just thought I was beautiful how I am. Oh well though, whatever. Other things are kinda getting to me lately too. I'm not close with anyone really (besides him), my acting career is at a standstill, SLOTH is dead, Selfism is dead, etc. Even the things I used to do like keeping a journal I can't do now because of what happened with my mom. The person I used to be is slowly dying it seems and it upsets me. So what do I do? Rebel against everything and just try to start over? But the thing is, sometimes I am happy, I just wish it was more often. bah, perhaps I'll write again soon. At least this is somewhere my mom and people I know can never find.   "
29623,4042056,"26,July,2004",2004-07-26,"   (This was copied from another online journal I had last year. I wanted to consolidate.)   Today was the last day of summer school. I took health 2 to get it out of the way for next year. I think I must be retarded or something, I got an A-!!! How is it possiblenot to get an A+ in Health!!!!????? Wow I am reallyreally dumb. Oh well, so it goes. I sent Tay another letter today. I hope he likes my letters. I'm still confused on the whole ""do I Love him"" subject. I just want to talk to him, especially after the letter I sent to him telling him how I'm feeling. There's still more we need to talk about too when he gets home. I wonder if he thinks I'm complicating things and making them into a much bigger deal than they actually are. I like this because I can ramble and there is no reason not to, because hey, no one will ever read it. I think I'm going to confess all my thoughts on here. Not like the poeple who it's about will see, right? Exactly.   I am going to start an online comic. I've decided. My favorite comics are Penny Arcade and Road Waffles, so I'm going to be a big poser and create my own (prolly with my best friend Nicole). Be on the look out for some thing cool from yours truly. Then again, this might just become another of my projects that I talk about but never do (like becoming a rockstar, taking over the world, etc...), but I'm hoping I'll actually follow through with this.I'm supposed to spend time with my dad this afternoon so I'm wishing for the best. He is the Nazi King. I hate him. Oh well, so it goes. Whatever. Then tonight I'm prolly going to my friend Emily's house, so that's good at least. She just got diagnosed as bipolar so I'm kinda worried she's gonna spend all night complainging to me about it and how much it sucks. It does, I agree, but gras. Ok, it's father/nazi time now, later kids (I Love how I act like I'm really talking to someone).   "
29624,4042056,"18,August,2004",2004-08-18,"   We broke up. Wow... Over 1 year 3 months.... all over.  Perhaps I'll explain more later? For now here's the condensed version: After seeing him last night; him being stoned and pissy, I really was at the end of my rope. I told him we just needed to talk because I was done chasing after him, etc. Don't know how much he remembered, but tonight he called me as he promised he would. We both said that we werent happy, he said he isn't still in love with me, i thought we should maybe take a break but first see eachother to decide, he didnt want to see me- he said he didnt want to make it work out, so it was decided we would be single as of tonight. I called Nicole and cried. We're supposed to see eachother soon to just see how things are. He's under the impression that we're gonna still hookup and things will be the same pretty much. How very wrong. I'll try just being friends, but he claimed that he's unhappy when with me, so how could hanging out work anyways? He's always so fickle and uncertain... I never know. We will see I suppose, but a couple things: Thanks to my friends for being there, thanks to Abby Marsh for endowing me with wisdom, and thank you Muse for conveniently adding a soundtrack to my life.   I don't think it's really sunk in yet. I'm SINGLE. I donno, all too surreal. I'm not sad yet. Though I know I will be on my birthday. Oh well... I guess so it goes. And THIS is why I keep up my guard with people... So Taylor, Goodbye. I hope you have fun fucking Elise or Ellie or Christina or anyone else you like, and yes, let's try to be friends, but I will not take shit from you ever again... and this will not destroy me. Hm, one would think I would've drawn something like this:  But no, I drew my character in Sloth, like this:  Very strange.   "
29625,4042056,"16,August,2004",2004-08-16,"   Ok, need to catch up. Saw taylor, gave him the sweatshirt. That was a couple days ago but i need to update. When i arrived (11 am) he was already drunk and looked very different than i had remembered (long black hair, scraggly blond goatee growing, heh). it was weird. I tried to talk to him but he was drunk and insisted I drink too, so i did, and we fooled around and then fell asleep together until it was time for me to leave. Weird stuff. He's seriously turning into an alcoholic- ick. The next day I had plans with jon woodside, which was nice, and he helped me set up for the party and we also went to part of a play (we got lost on the way there and home). It was nice but I always felt like he wasnt having fun or something. nicole and colin came out to lead us home and nicole showed me the ring colin gave her- a promise ring. it's a claddagh ring (her favorite) with an emerald in the heart and diamonds on the sides. GORGEOUS!! But it made me sad realizing taylor would never do something like that for me... i mean tay and i arent sure if we're really dating... how could he love me enough to do something like that for me. Gah. Oh well. I need to find a guy who'll do that for me. Buy me some crazy ring like this...   Not that it's the money- but the fact that they'd buy something that gorgeous and priceless and beautiful for me.... just wow. I just hope someday I'll find that kind of overwhelming love. Also, i feel bad that i dont return jon's love in the same way. this was his profile after we hung out:  ""Being lost in a car for whatever amount of time is not bad at all if you're with the right person, and so long as you make lefts. The play was good, but not all of my focus was on it. I more enjoyed the buildings.And when she walked in the ""Fire Lane"" I couldn't help but agree. I wish she could be relaxed though. I'm always entertained, and every minute with her is nothing but beauty. Speaking of beauty, did you ever see a beautiful red-haired girl glowing in red light? The tank top, the hair falling down so simply and cute,and the smile after a growl escapes her throat that confirms insanity; You're crazy about her....""  I mean that's so sweet and stuff but he's not who i wish thought those things about me... which is unfortunate, for both of us. The party happened the 14th and was a lot of fun. Here's who all came: Emily Bryant, Emily adelstien, Adam yasinow, Catherine Kachurek, Jita fumich, Sean Fitzgerald, Nicole pursell, Brendan tucker, Sarah blair, Kat white, Peter hedman, Claire oppenhiem, Carly Hoffman, Rob rodems, Avey venable, Elise O, J McNamara, Heather Wilson, Hannah ewert-krocker, Colin boyle, Eugene Kozlenko, Erin Bell, Chelsea Nicol, Annie + Sam, Taylor shockey, Pat whitlow. Some great gifts included an AMAZING dress from Nicole, condoms from Erin, and a dvd of almost porn from emily, plus more. Good times. Tay and I had fun i think, though he got mad at me part way through and there was some drama with nicole + parents. But then after people left Taylor, avey, and emily slept over, which was fun. We went in the hot tub and went out in the field and watched the stars (saw shooting stars- incredible!!), and it was a good night. Tay and I had an interesting incident with Avey in my bed and he's always hoping for a girl girl threesome. Which im just always unsure about- obviously with avey cuz she's my friend, but also becvause i dont want to watch him do stuff with another girl. Maybe im weird or soemthing but really. And im not bi- i dont think, so it'd be no fun for me either. But we had fun later in the night then too so that was fun. We talked about the future of us... and whether there is one. He says he doesnt know... he says he'll always love me, and even if we break up we'll still hang out and be friends and maybe hookup, but NO WAY. bah, what a jerk. i cried... i hate doing that. I hate showing him how much he can hurt me, and how much he really does mean to me, but of course, i did. BUt he was tired so that was the end of that. Who knows what'll happen now. Maybe I'll see him tomorrow after spending time with avey on her birthday (hoorah! 15!!) Also I just wish i could have a relationship with him that even came close to his with Elise. Grr, that makes me so mad, I wish he'd just fuck her already and get it out of his system... maybe he'd love me again then?  Anyways, now to the sexuality thing... but I warn you- personal stuff here so it may be in your best interest not to read (Hah! Like there are readers!!). I don't want to do stuff with girls- I find vaginas pretty gross. However, I find girls really hot. Only two things actually turn me on. (Other things i can be like ""ooh"" or what not, but only two things get me in the mood seriously). They are: #1. reading certain things- like notproud.com, lustful stupid stuff is so hot... wow... i know it's childish, but that dirty stuff is so hot, or just stuff that makes me think of dirty stuff- like reading clockwork orange- mmm! #2. Certain pictures of girls. I like fake porn. I dont want girls doing stuff with guys, or girls with girls, or even girls doing stuff to themselves.... but just really suggestive pictures of girls I find SOOOOO SEXY. Like victoria secret catalogs are golden... and like this pic is amazing:   So what they hell!? I mean, sometimes I think it'd be fun just to try doing stuff with a girl, and like ive had a bunch of dreams where i do stuff with girls, but i would never want to date one. I could never lust after a vagina (not that i ever lust after penis though either...), but i dont know. Girls in lingerie and stuff is my thing i guess. Bah... i've sorta talked to nicole and some people about this... but i dont really want to discuss it cuz i think it'd either weird them out, or, they'd think I'm just trying to become bi because everyone else is! But really, im not, i dont like girls, they just turn me on! Gah... weird times.... but when arent they? I'll update again when I can.... so for now non-existant readers- so long so long.   "
29626,4042056,"11,August,2004",2004-08-11,"   Here is the LOW-down. So, I hung out with Nicole and Avey, which was really nice. I was kinda hesitant at first because I was worried things would eb weird with Nicole and me, but they weren't. It's like we can always pick up where we left off, which i'm really happy about. I donno, her and I just have a couple issues, like the whole competing thing. I don't mean to, and i dont think she means to either, but we do. And I thought avey would be another competition (because at times it does seem that way), but it wasn't. We had a good time and I was happy. I ran into Christian with Avey on Coventry and it was kinda awkward. He's so feminine and emo now. He was there with his girlfriend Alison, and i always get jealous of her, even though he's not my type anymore. But he is still cute. Oh well, so it goes. Spent time just with Avey, which was nice, and then later that night I spent a lot of time just talking and walking with Nicole. That was really nice. We covered things like boys, sexuality in general, and friends. Good times getting lost in Shaker/Cl. Heights at 1 am. Anyways, I was supposed to see taylor, but it didn't work. The next day i was going to see him but he didnt want me to come, so whatever. But he was just such a jerk. I talked to pat whitlow to figure stuff out and he said he talked to tay and here is supposidly what's going on: Tay came to the realization at camp that there are a ton of other girls out there, and should he really date the same girl for all of high school? Well... back to that... AGAIN. UGH! We were supposed to see eachother today but he blew me off (I was SOOOOO ANGRY), but i'm going to his house tomorrow morning. I hope it goes well. And if not, at least then I can make up my mind to move on. I mean there are other guys out there. Like Midsummer Night's dream boy (oh i hope he's in the play), and MJ started hitting on me tonight (ick), and jon (of course). Jon really is the sweetest guy. Here are parts of his conversation from tonight!  Earthen Herald: I just see you, something magnificent and colorful standing out in this gray world, and i feel like paying attnetion to anyone else would be like playing with a stik at the beach, with my back turned and missing the breath taking sunset . It seems like people are looking through telescopes and seeing further, but missing whats right in front of them; whist i look through a kaliedescope, and see only one thing, but that one thing is too beautiful for words.  who's to say who's getting the most? If i sat for hours, i couldn't put this stuff on paper but all i have to do is think about you...You bring out the best in me, what can I say.   Ah! You see? I don't deserve that at all. He doesn't think tay deserves me... i wish he was right. Also, today (the 11th) was my mom's birthday.    (One thing I made for her). I also gave her a bunch of cd's I burnt at Avey's house. Wow, she realllly bailed me out there. All these people are too good to me... Need to repay them! But how? Gras...I'm nervous about tomorrow. His sweatshirt isn't finished, I should be sewing... but I had to journal. Ok, I'm out.   "
29627,4042056,"08,August,2004",2004-08-08,"   Bah. I should've updated sooner, but I've been kind of busy. Yesterday was a really bad day for me. The first horrible thing was my little kitten, Pantalaimon suddenly was dying. We don't know what happened to him or anything, maybe he was poisoned from eating/drinking something? No one knows. Anyways, it was bad times holding him in my arms in the car on the way to the animal emergency hospital, crying and rubbing him, trying to make him stay alive. But in the end, nothing worked, and he died. So it goes. It was really sad though because I spent sooo much time with that cat, and he really meant a lot to me.    So I was upset and called Taylor. Of course he didn't answer because he never does. I was sad a lot that day, so tried him again that night to just talk. He was an asshole and wasn't comforting at all. He frankly didn't care. And he was honest when he told me: ""you know what, im gonna go, im really tired. No... that was a lie. I'm not tired, im just bored."" So wonderful, he's bored talking to me. So I asked: ""Do you even still like me?"" Tay: ""I don't know. I think so. I haven't seen you for a while.... I  just don't know."" Me: ""I guess not."" It led into other things... like him thinking we both have changed, things are awkward between us, etc.  Fanfuckingtastic!!  exactly when I need to be brought down even more, whoa, there's taylor (as usual), to make me feel like shit! Wonderful timing Sir! So, as a tribute, here's my buddy icon:   The cartoon is funnier though. But, when I was sobbing and upset last night, thinking life is worthless, who do I talk to, but Jon Woodside! Seriously, that guy is like my guardien angel. He just says the most incredible things to me, and i needed it so much. I dont think i can ever repay him for how supportive he's always been, but I hope he knows how much he means to me.  Also, after listening to Muse (wow, they are godly) on repeat during this whole thing, (compliments of: http://www.bandbuilder.com/muse/index.php?ref_code=D52238), and being inspired by Jon, I made a new things to do list. One of the things on there is to dump taylor if he does not start treating me better by my birthday. So that's like two weeks... good luck taylor! I suggest being sweet or you may miss out on some fun stuff... because i have gotten pretty damn experienced dating that kid, not to be cocky (heh heh, i made a pun). But seriously, if things don't work out with him, I'm just going to seize the opportunity and say ""fuck it!"" and go do stuff ive been wanting to do for a while... i.e. the kid from CVLT, a couple college kids, and even some random people like adam klauss (God, reading Clockwork orange makes me want him, except it's purely lust). I guess we'll see what happens. I mean I love tay, so that's my first priority, but hey, if that falls through and i wind up with purely the lust side, is it really so bad!? Well, he gets home tomorrow, and i'm just anxious about it. I know he's gonna be disappointed with how I look (i didnt lose weight like he wanted), but i'm gonna try not to care! I need to start detaching myself from him! Good plan!  Anyways, we got 3 new kittens today! Yay! The little boy (mine) is asleep on my lap right now and I love him! Yay! Also, I went to 3 auditions today. Think any of them will follow through? I don't, but hey- who knows!?   "
29628,4042056,"03,August,2004",2004-08-03,"   Survey thing about my ""perfect guy."" So here are my answers. Then I went through and looked at what things Taylor fits. If he fits my ideal guy for a category, I'll  put the text  in red.    Hair color?: Black Eye color?: Blue  Height?: 6â€™    Muscles: Yes Long hair or short?: Shaggy hair Glasses?: no  Piercings?: yes Clothing: Punky    Big butt or little?:little Chest hair?:No Buff or skinny?:skinny Teeth?:Nice teeth Funny or serious?: both Party-hopper or more stay-at-home?: both Should he be able to bake or cook?:No Does he have a best friend?:sure Is it okay for him to have a lot of female friends?: depends, but yes  Out-going or shy?:out-going usually Sarcastic or sincere?:Both but more sincere Does he love his mother?:To an extent Should he watch chick-flicks?:with me    Would he be a smoker?:No way  How about a drinking?:Only with me    And swearing?:Only sometimes  Would he play with your hair?:definitely    Would he have more than one girlfriend at a time?:NO  Would he pay for you when you're on a date?:occasionally   Does he kiss on the first date?:yes Where would you go for dinner?:somewhere nice   Would he buy you flowers?:yes Would he lay under the stars with you and spout about random philosophies?:Yes sir! Would he write poetry about you?:yes yes Would he use endearments?:sometimes    Would he hang out with you and YOUR friends?:Yes How about you hanging out with him and HIS friends?:Yes  Would he walk you up to the door at the end of the evening?:yes Would you hold hands?:Yes What sports would he play?: Soccer    Would he skateboard?:Yes! Snowboard?:Yes  Can he sing?:Definitely    Play the guitar?:YES Play piano?:Yes Play the drums?:Yes  Can he keep his room clean?:Sometimes    Is he an artist of sorts?:Yes  Does he write songs for you?:YES    Does he have pets?:Yes  Does he watch the sun rise and set with you?:YES What kind of car does he drive?:Something decently nice    How old is he?:older than me  What's his name?:Oliver     So, that's about half I'd say, maybe a little over that he fits. But I do love him... I just wish he seemed like he loved me once in a while... it's mostly the romantic stuff that he doesn't fit on this survey afterall. But oh well.   I got my headshots back today! Hooray, some came out well. One more step on my path to becoming a real actress.  Here's my favorite as of right now:   I'm excited about my acting career... I am really going to try to work on it and go places. Tonight I tried out for A Midsummer Night's Dream at the Chagrin Valley Little Theater, and although it's just a community theater, I wanted to try doing shakespeare. So I went, read some scenes, turned some heads (yay!), and it was fun. There was this guy there, who was so cute, and decently talented, and kept talking to me/looking at me, and offered me a ride home! And he was really hot. Damn... I hope I get to see more of him! (After the audition also the director came outside and said to me that I did a ""tremendous job,"" that I ""have a beautiful voice"" and ""a great understanding of the characters."" She also said that I will definitely be getting a call from her this weekend, meaning I'm definitely in! Yay! Now it's just a matter of what part! I think I'm going to have fun with this. In the Taylor department... He's just always such a jerk! Gras! But maybe things will be different when he's home? We'll see... And hey- there's always hot actor boy? Hah, I'm kidding, my heart is taylor's.... as long as he is nice again when he gets home!   "
29629,4042056,"02,August,2004",2004-08-02,"   So, I spent last night at Maddie's house after I did the church performance thing (which went decently...). It was fun hanging with her- I'll miss her a lot next year. She's one of the only people I know that I can just sit with and talk to for hours and never get bored. We can even do separate things and still just enjoy eachother's company. It's nice. Anyways, one of the things we talked about was the issue of ""doing stuff"" and tricks/tips, etc. We exchanged some advice (I told her a lot of kinkier ideas because i've researched + experimented a fair amount) and there are a couple things that she said that i need to remember... plus some things that I told her, that I just need to do again.  - When kissing him, use my tongue to do an upward flick/movement in his mouth (like a ""come here"" motion). - If my head is tilted enough, use my tongue to outline the inside of his mouth between his teeth and lips (apparently makes guys think of sex). - Suprise him again (haven't done it for a while). After he leaves the room for something and comes back, go crazy. - Buy lingerie!!    (examples of what I want!) - Request things (pretend to want things, if only to make him feel good about himself). - Come up behind him quietly and just start seducing him without him knowing I'm coming until I'm there. - Go skinny dipping!!  Well, those are some of the main ones, so I'll make sure to try/repeat those.   As far as Taylor and I are though right now... I'm really not sure. Like we're still dating and stuff... but things have been pretty bad between us (with the phone calls and stuff) while he's been gone. I just hope that when he gets home things will be like they used to be. I miss how they were and I miss being happy together with him. Well, we'll see. Also... today's my brother's birthday. Happy birthday Rich!   "
31070,4042287,"19,August,2004",2004-08-19,   i am SO confused. and that is ALL i have to say 
31071,4042287,"17,August,2004",2004-08-17,"   One of the things that has been coming to mind a LOT lately is the question- â€œwho on EARTH am I?â€ Everything I do and everything I say and everything I think seems to bring that to mind. well I was looking through some Christian song lyrics last night and God really used them to speak to me. THIS is who I am. . .   Casting Crowns â€œWho I Amâ€  Who am I, that the Lord of all the earth Would care to know my name Would care to feel my hurt Who am I, that the Bright and Morning Star Would choose to light the way For my ever wandering heart  Not because of who I am But because of what You've done Not because of what I've done But because of who You're  Chorus: I am a flower quickly fading Here today and gone tomorrow A wave tossed in the ocean A vapor in the wind Still You hear me when I'm calling Lord, You catch me when I'm falling And You've told me who I am I am Yours, I am Yours  Who Am I, that the eyes that see my sin Would look on me with love and watch me rise again Who Am I, that the voice that calmed the sea Would call out through the rain And calm the storm in me  I am Yours Whom shall I fear Whom shall I fear 'Cause I am Yours I am Yours   I am His! Oh that sounds so much easier than searching through all the crap this world has to offer to try and find joy! He is the only one who can offer true joy! God sent His Son to die on that cross so that I could be saved! What a WONDERFUL thought!   For so long I was deceived Enslaved by these chains Blinded to Your forgiveness If only I knew Your love Giving Your life to save me from this pain Broken and bleeding I turned You away Now I have seen the scars inflicted by my hands The Innocence spilled to save me Reaching to the hand that brought You this pain And now I am on my knees Crying the way You wept for me Crying, crying tears of shame  -As I lay dying   well I want to write something right now but I think the lyrics to these songs describe exactly what I want to write a lot better than I could ever explain it. . .   forgive me Jesus this time i cry i rip my heart out to give to You alone it never did me any good hold me close, wash my mind destroy the me that lives inside  -underoath   that is my prayer. My plea. My cry. I want to be Godâ€™s     .   You're afraid of what it takes to give it all away Doing enough just to get by, just to get by Thinking that you live the right life Are you doing just enough to get by To try and fool 'em into thinking That you live the right life  -pillar   that was me. I was scared to give him EVERYTHING. I was scared to give certain things over to Him. Especially relationships. That was something I had control over it seemed. But â€œseemedâ€ is the big word there. I didnâ€™t have control over it at all. I was scared to let people that meant a lot to me know that I actually cared. I hid everything. . . I hid the real me from a lot of people.   So what's the point of even trying to hide Cause everything you do is seen by omnipotent eyes  -pillar   I changed my ways I'm never goin' back again  -pillar   I have â€œgone backâ€ so to speak SO many times. Gone back to living for myself. I donâ€™t want to ever go back again. I am His and that is what I want to be forever!   A daily walk with Him is exactly what it takes â€“pillar   One of the things my parents always stressed was spending time with the Lord every day. As I was growing up thatâ€™s what I did because that was what I HAD to do. It helped me grow closer and closer to Him. I didnâ€™t really realize it at the time but now that I am older, and donâ€™t spend time with Him every day because it seems like I â€œdonâ€™t have timeâ€, I realize how much that affected my walk with the Lord. Christianity is not just a Sunday thing and occasionally a Sunday night thing. Christianity is a DAILY walk with Him. Now THAT is what I want!  Your sister in Christ, Alycia "
31072,4042287,"12,August,2004",2004-08-12,"   why don't my parents trust me? what have i EVER done to not deserve to be trusted. NOTHING. maybe if i had done something BAD at one point in time i can see how they might not trust me too much but i havent done anything bad. nothing at all. and they dont trust me in the LEAST bit. i was asked the other day what the worst thing i had ever done was and i couldnt even ANSWER it. there is so much crap i could do if i wanted to. i could give them SO many reasons not to trust me if i wanted to. but you know what. . . i dont want to. the problem is that if my parents think thats what i am like then what is stopping me from being like that? you know what else it proves? it proves how much nobody knows me. i hide the real me so much that my parents dont even see it. i came on the computer tonight hoping to go on msn and have a deep talk. well i came on the computer but didnt make it onto msn because my dad changed the password to the net nanny so that i couldnt go on. i figured i would suck it up and just surf the net for some christian sites. i went to surf the net only to find that my dad must have also blocked the possibility to view sites. i couldnt even open up ONE single freaking CHRISTIAN website. not one. they were all blocked. now if my parents, or anyone for that matter, tells me that my parents DO trust me i am    na flip. it is plainly OBVIOUS that they dont when they wont even let me go on the internet when all i want to look at is CHRISTIAN things. augh "
31073,4042287,"12,August,2004",2004-08-12,   wow has life ever changed from when i was a child... sometimes it seems as if my childhood has been stolen from me. everything was so much easier when i was younger. when i had absolutely everything to lose. when i wasnt scared to CARE. when i was wasnt scared to love. . . 
31646,4043476,"18,august,2004",2004-08-18,"   Intro    The plan was simple. 3 guys - me, sander and shelley - went to a youth hostel without parents for 4 days       story    Day 1      Day 1 started with the arrvival at the youth hostel. Everything looked real fine but we could just stay for half an hour cause we agreed with some friends at oostende (marco en alexander). The swimming pool of Oostende was fine we where there for 4 or 5 hours. There where some special effects in the water slide, really it was like u where in the universe -> funny :). After that we just took the tram to the hostel and started unpakking.  "

31212,4043736,"26,July,2004",2004-07-26,"   Its an early Downtown Fredericton morning. I can hear the buses wheezing around down near Kings Place... I'm sittin' here at Dana Banana's computer, playin' with the old bloggity blogington, and i discover a crappyfact; the only way you can customize zee Blog is to comprehend the madness that is HTML. Kindergarten kids are being taught this in schools for petes sake.   I used to try and hide it...I used to avoid situations where one might use HTML...I would even try to get other people to use it for me....I was ashamed. Now, the painful pain just got too painful to bare on my shoulders alone! (Oh, the PAIN!)   I'm seeing a councilor about it now, learning how to cope with my HTML illiteracy... The first step is admitting it. So here i am, exposing my bitter truth to my Blog, and to my Blog family. My name is Natalie Perry, and i am HTML illiterate.     .....For information on HTML illiteracy and HTML literacy programs, please call your local HTML Literacy Centre.  "
31213,4043736,"26,July,2004",2004-07-26,"   As of Monday evening, Natalie Perry of Marysville, New Brunswick, discovered today how easy it is to create an online Blog. A  Blog, (Blogus Onlinius Maximus)     is an online forum type thing, and has changed Ms Perry's world view. ""It 's so easy to make your own Blog!"" Freaked Perry, ""I think I'm gonna Freak !""         Something shadows her Blog inspired joy, however.   Perry is upset over a huge  Blob backlash, caused by her Blog use.  At a press conference today, Perry responded to the allegations of anti-Blob sentiments, "" I love Blobs! ... I've often thought about becoming a Blob myself!"""
31214,4043736,"18,August,2004",2004-08-18,"   I was sitting at Second Cup today, sucking back a medium iced mocha, and i watch the people that pass by my window seat. I notice a lot of people smoking cigarettes. Businessmen, bus drivers, pregnant fourteen year olds and guys that look like Roadies but probably aren't...all hanging outside Kings Place draggin' on cigarettes. Every single one of these ""smokers"" have a confident heir about them...their heads up, hands posed and blowing smoke directly in the face of Cancer, heart disease and the surgeon general. Smoking is instant confidence; just by puffing away on one of these things, a person can stand alone in a crowd and not feel awkward, but the opposite. Smokers seem to feel ""cool"" when they're haulin' on a cigarette. I love smoking. I just can't afford it. Being cool is not in my budget. I think cigarettes taste like shit and are the worst possible thing you can do for your health too.  BUT  I'm telling you now, if you want to look on top of your game, pull out your pack, tap a long white peice of design genius, light it on fire, and you're a dragon; a solitary god. You're breathing fire now, and you're one tough son of a bitch. Having a smoke says "" Look at me, breathing flames. I know its bad for me, but i don't give a fuck - I don't care. Smoke is coming out of my mother fucking mouth! Beat that, losers!!"" You have to be making some money to afford them, so its a symbol of wealth too. Smokers band together; ""hey, ya gatta light?"" or ""Can i get a smoke off ya man?"" they take care of eachother. If you're a smoker, you are already a member of an international group. A stranger in a foreign land ? Start smoking. You'll meet lots of other people. Just keep a lot of cigs and a light on hand, and you got yourself instant friends. You also have instant enemies; non-smokers - but who needs those losers anyway?  "
31215,4043736,"12,August,2004",2004-08-12,"   I received three letters today in the mail.          The first letter was from the the CIBC.  I applied for a student VisaCard on the third.  Since the envelope didn't contain a card, i guessed rejection, and i guessed right.  They were very polite about it though, like, ""sorry, try again"" I have no job, so, its really probably best.  I'll have to work on that credit rating...             The second letter was from the Student Financial Centre.  I feared the worst, but they were just informing me of my ""status"".  I'm on probation...they're gonna give me a loan, but if i ever decide to fuck up again they're gonna destroy me.  Fair enough.  I could give them some medical excuses that would take me off this ""black list"", and i probably will, just for my own protection.               The third letter was from the University of New Brunswick. ""Oh god, this can't be good"" i thought as i ripped the puppy open.   I scanned it...nothing negative....then i come to the meat of the issue; they want my transcripts from the Craft College.  Oh Jesus. Withdrawl- Withdrawl- Withdrawl- Withdrawl-......oh, they're gonna love that.  But Dr. Deb Johnston, my guardian angel political science prof. knows all about my poor academic standing at the old College of Craft and Design.   Surely she's still going to let me come to UNB in the fall?       I'm jobless and stressed out.  I'm just barely treading water.  My parents are poorer than i am. Dana's working 20 hours a day.    He's losing his mind.       Laura just called and she wants money.  I can't wait until this month from hell dies and rots in the ground.  "
31216,4043736,"08,August,2004",2004-08-08,"   Hey whats up  I feel great. Better than i have in a long time! Yay!!   Tomorrow i must beg to be let into UNB.  I wonder if dropping Greggy's name would help my chances? (:  I'll be talking to Dr. Deb Johnston.   If i don't get in, I'll have to work full time somewhere, thats not something i ever look forward to.  I'm so fricking sick of working for other people. Making them money and bringing their customers back to their crap-ass stores while they pay me minimum wage.  Poeple shouldn't be making minimum wage unless they are 16 and babysitting.  I'm twenty-three.  Twenty-three and a half and counting...  I'm sure now that i'm an Entrepreneur, just one that has no money, and is just rediscovering the concept of self motivation.  I'd love to run a coffeeshop/giftshop.  I've got it all in my head - all i need to do is  look up the millions of miles of paperwork required to do so.  Dana and i are moving out together finally!   I'm pretty stoked (:  I'm going to Diane and Marlas this week to work at their store.   August  "

1515,4045197,"26,July,2004",2004-07-26,"    Hey there guys,   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hows everything going. Today after class I went and helped my Britney Drew pack alla her things into boxes and put them in her dads truck and then we went to her new house (her grand-mas house) and unpacked everything that we brought the first trip. Lets just say we started at like 11ish and didnt get done loading,unloading, and unpacking till about 3ish. Then we went to get some lunch cause we were like starvin, and went back to her house and ate it. And helped her dad bring some other stuff to the truck of theirs that was gonna go to the storage room they had to buy. Britney and I stayed at her apartment and started packin some more things in her room. We almost finished but not quite. The only thing is they gotta be out of there apartment by the end of the week (saturday).   Other than that, nothings really happened. I have 2 more days of school left. Tomorrow and Wednesday, im excited. This weekend were going to Kemah, Texas for one night. Were leaving early saturday morning and coming back sunday night, and then the 3rd is Jr. Registration, and then on the 5th we leave for Baton Rouge till the 8th for Conclave, i get to see Byron this weekend but not for most of the time. It sucks, but i gotta suck it up. lol.  Byron and I have new songs their:   baby when i look at you you know it breaks my heart in two how beautiful you are seen you in a million dreams now your finally here with me we will never be apart i wanna hold you forever thats all i'll ever need chorus you are my love you are my life my heart and soul the truest friend i'll ever know all of my dreams, my fantasy, my reality i love everything you are yes i do everytime i close my eyes it hits me so deep inside how real this feeling is i'm intoxicated by your touch its a sweet sweet rush i'm in love with your kiss your the one that i trust the most you changed me chorus 2 times i love everything you are...You Are by Jimmy Wayne.  She thinks I walk on water She thinks I hung the moon She tells me every morning ""They just don't make men like you"" She thinks I've got it together She swears I'm as tough as nails But I don't have the heart to tell her That she don't know me that well Chorus: She don't know how much I need her She don't know I'd fall apart Without her kiss, without her touch Without her faithful loving arms She don't know that it's all about her She don't know I can't live without her She's my world, she's my everything And she thinks she needs me Sometimes she cries on my shoulder When she's lying next to me But she don't know that when I hold her That she's really holding me Holding me Chorus Yeah, now the funny thing is She thinks she's the lucky one Chorus She thinks I walk on water She thinks I hung the moon....She Thinks She Needs Me by Andy Griggs.  Well, thats enough for now. ill update this new journal later. "
13414,4049195,"29,July,2004",2004-07-29,"   Lydia, oh Lydia; have you met Lydia? Lydia the tatooed lady.  Homework is yet to be done. This post only exists to remind myself I have a blog that still exists and 'needs' regular updating. After having several blogs on rival websites that have failed miserably, I feel I should start with something on the site that more or less started it all.  May start transferring thoughts online. These have already been compiled with papier mache and twigs in the garden shed, and simply need a lick of paint before they are released on the world.   They will be stolen. This frightens me. Well, at least I'm the only person aware of this page thus far. This makes me joyous.  "
13415,4049195,"27,July,2004",2004-07-27,"   As the tennis ball howls at the moon, an elderly teenager sits at his laptop, considering starting the English homework he should have done last week. Alas, it has not been done; it will be put off until the very last minute like everything else this year.  He has joined the mob, jumped onto the bandwagon. He is now a blogger. What the hell is he doing?  He is  Daxiel Kahnsworth  and requests that anyone reading this portion of faeces does not judge him too harshly on the disgusting mediocrity of this first entry. Why does he care about approval from faceless online entities? The answer will not come with time.  "
13416,4049195,"04,August,2004",2004-08-04,"   Well, as expected, the matinee yesterday went pretty crap. The crowd was composed of the usual suspects; old people and primary school children. The elderly members of the audience either didn't hear or understand the jokes, and the primary school children left halfway between Act Two. More than a slight debacle, but we kept going through it all and survived. My microphone was falling off my head consistently through most of the songs I sing, especially giving me trouble through the choreography. It's bad enough to wear Madonna-style microphone headsets, but if they don't perform their intended function, it goes beyond a joke.  Tonight all was amended. The microphone no longer sucked because the tech crew worked out how they are meant to sit on your head. After I got over the embarassment of finding I was wearing the thing in entirely the wrong fashion, I was intensely relieved that I could relax on stage without fear the microphone was about to eat my face or fall on the floor. The crowd was pumped, laughed at all the right places and enjoyed the bits I love performing. I'm truly having an awesome time.  The surreal nature of time's behaviour when one is on stage goes beyond explanation. Time simply races, and the whole experience is entirely out-of-body goodness. I will miss  Hot Mikado  by the time Friday night comes, but having my life back is something I will not take for granted!   Homework I have not done because of  Hot Mikado  and blog:    Preparation for English Creative Response SAC on  The Quiet American   Maths sheet  Public speaking preparation (more on this later)   Well, that's it for now. The mundane rubbish about homework was posted because only I read the blog at this stage.   If you come back and read this, if the foolish idea of advertising my nonsensical ramble to the world occurs, do not blame me, for you were not meant to read this. It is your own fault and I shall hear no complaints.  Hail Mary full of grace, help me find a parking space. I'm not Catholic.  "
13417,4049195,"02,August,2004",2004-08-02,"   Hot Mikado  dress rehearsal today went totally shit. I'm shit. The chorus is shit. The microphones are shit. It's all shit and that's the way it will probably stay until Friday night when we will put on a powerhouse mediocre performance to end a shitty run of shitty shit.  Those worries discussed in 'The butterflies attack' were not without reason. I shall write again after the matinee, simply to tell you how poorly it went. Hmm. Argh.  "
13418,4049195,"01,August,2004",2004-08-01,"   Is it worse to be the man who intentionally isolates himself from others by pretending he is weird, or the man who is unconscious of his weirdness and wonders why he remains distant from the world?  This week, Kahnsworth appears in an 'academic' version of a disgusting bastardisation of Gilbert and Sullivan's  The Mikado . Named  Hot Mikado , its world is a suprising accurate caricature of Japan today. The main Japanese elements remain, but all else has been replaced with American features - accents, clothing, all reminiscent of 1940s America.   The nervousness would be easy to deal with if I could actually justify my involvement in the musical. I am continuously ambivalent about my part in it, consistently revising why I choose to be in it in the first place, and why I continued my involvement to the very end.  It is a school musical, so the bar is not raised very high. I want to exceed the bar, impress all, a triumph of form and meaning. I love chucking that in writings all the time, because it sounds like I know something about art.  Is my entire personality a facade? Although at times the answer would certainly be yes, no, no it isn't.  The people I have met and got to know through the musical are superb. But have I actually gotten to know any of them? Continuous superficial conversations on my part have led to my knowing I can talk shit with many people, but not many new friends. The amount of friends I have at the moment is not alarming at all; I am happy, I have several.   But, as the adage from  Full House  goes: ""Friends are like jello, you can never have too much.""  So it's either poor grammar or poor semantics if you are to quote  Full House  correctly. Oh dear. How American. Nevermind.   Post Script:  Eric Bana has been announced as the new James Bond by  News of the World , an exceedingly unreliable tabloid. It would be extremely interesting if it is true, but I will continue to doubt the reliability of this information until I see Bana in the next Bond film.   Why, when I write 'Bond', do I consistently make a typographical error and write 'Bong'? I'm not addicted to marijuana... yet.  "

Michigan Statutes stipulate that before a child can enroll in kindergarten, he or she must be five (5) years old on or before December 1.       Each spring the district conducts a Kindergarten Registration to identify and enroll youngsters who will enter kindergarten in the fall. Informational evening meetings are held in the spring for parents. Newspapers will announce the dates.       It greatly assists the districtâ€™s planning efforts if all kindergarten students are identified in early spring. Parents should contact the Student Enrollment Office or plan to attend Kindergarten Registration if they have a child who meets the age requirements.   Pupils are assigned to either morning or afternoon sessions based upon geographical location. Sessions are three hours and five minutes. Daily attendance is stressed because kindergarten is an integral part of the total instructional program.""       *grmbl* Leslie could have started last year if she were in Michigan. She was ready. We fought them in Kansas to let her to no avail. AND she's been in half a day preschool for 2 and a half years. I want to go back to work and only having half a day school for her complicates things substantially.  "

26391,4052167,"27,July,2004",2004-07-27,"   We needed someplace to put all this info we are collecting that Jason can get to from work, I can get to from home..even Debi and Mitz can post stuff if they so desire. :)    Voila. A Moving Blog....    SO.  Here's what we have so far:  We want to move back to Rochester ASAP. Jason has his Michigan nursing lisense (Hooray) and is in the process of contacting hospitals to set up interviews there on Aug 2-4 (Mon - Wed).   We are leaving here around 5 pm on Friday, July 30 and will drive like crazy people with a goal of arriving at Debi's late Saturday night.    I understand that VBS is Aug 1-5 so Debi's gonna get the kids signed up for that.  "
26392,4052167,"12,August,2004",2004-08-12,"   Job : Well, yes.  As it stands right now, Jason has offers from North Oakland and St. Joseph Mercy (both in Pontiac) .   I also spoke with Julie from Beaumont yestarday and I really think they are going to offer him one too - their process is slower and they keep finding things in his file they need (she called yestarday to get a copy of his army paperwork).   House : Also Janet called about the log cabin - that looks pretty good too, depending on when we can move.  She didn't seem unsettled about our October target.   Money : So now it's really just a matter of finding the best way to get the most money in the shortest amount of time. Hehe.  Jason is spending his lunch hour today talking to travel nurse recruiters.  We thing that if he could get a quick 3 month assignment that paid big money (and they all do) that we'll just pack up the house - put everything in storage - and go to CA or Boston or Seattle or DC or wherever.  I'll homeschool for the 3 months and we'd live in a furnished  2 bdrm appt provided by the travel company.  I know it sounds crazy, but it'd be like a 3 month vacation.  It'd be terrific for the kids and lots of fun for us AND Jason can make huge money doing that.  Then by October, we'd have ample money to pay off everything here and start the way we want to start in Michigan.  It also has the added benefit of getting us away from here as quickly as possible.  So, that's the scoop! :)  Debi, I left Collin's shorts in your freezer *sigh* Can you mail them to me? I really need them.  He only has a couple of decent pairs of shorts....  "

Got up this morning and did nothing, then ran to Fort Dodge, Iowa to get my haircut and look for cell phone covers for my phone. I didn't have luck, so I guess i'll just have the plain old default one for awhile. Got home and picked up my pictures from Pamida from NYE. They turned out pretty good. If you wanna see em, just go to  urlLink http://public.fotki.com/rosco2007/  and have fun.          Well that's all I can think of to write about today, I'll catch ya later.          Rosco. "
5658,4052552,"30,July,2004",2004-07-30,"    Life sucks. I thought breaking up with Tara would affect her more than it would affect me. But, I'm wrong. As always. I'm not upset that I broke up with her. I'm not regretting it. I'm just a little confused. She just moved on soo quickly. So quickly that if it was a movie the dialogue would look something like:          Me: I don't think we should be together.          Tara: But ... but ... I love you.          Me: Goodbye.          -5 Days Later-          Tara: Hey look, there's Arik! I love Arik so much.          Somebody: What about Ross?          Tara: Ross who?          So yeah. Arik still thinks Tara loves me, which I doubt. Arik thinks me and Staci are gonna hook up and fall in love. I doubt it. We're just gonna stay good friends, but have a little more fun. That's not wrong, is it? Eh, I don't care.           Tara thinks me and her will be great friends. Which I doubt. I would consider it if she hadn't run off with one of my ... i dunno if I can say it but ... best (?) friends. But hey, she'd feel the same way if I ran off with ... hmm ... Tracy, or Tori. Who I barely know so I wouldn't do that. I've come to the conclusion that life sucks. Shit will happen, and I'm gonna let it. Arik and Tara can have all their fun and shit, and I'll just sit back and watch the drama unfold. It's bound to happen. And i'm not the only one that thinks so.          Adios.          Rosco. "

No. I was actually just bored and figured I'd write something in this thing so here I am. I just got back from an interview at Pamida, it was horrible, I suck at those things. Oh well, I have another interview at Fareway at 4 this afternoon, hopefully I'll have a job by next week. Woo.        &nbsp;   Damn, I can't think of anything to write in this bloody thing so i'm just gonna ramble. It seems me and Tara and done, forever. Oh, here's a shocker, she found someone new before me. That really surprised me, I thought I'd have a new girlfriend before she'd have a new boyfriend. Oh well, I guess i'll just be single for awhile. That's okay, I -love- being single. *rolls eyes* I have a few people on my mind but I know they'll say no, but w/e. :-( So if there's anyone out there that's single, CALL ME! or email me, whatever.       &nbsp;   I'll catch all you losers later.        &nbsp;   -Rosco.

5660,4052552,"27,July,2004",2004-07-27,"    Okay, so here I am, I have a new blog now and I havent updated the other one since May so I guess this is long overdue. For you people that don't know who I am, my name is Ross, but people call me Rosco (well atleast the cool people like Christine and Ashley). I'm 16 years old and I live in Humboldt, Iowa and I don't have a life. Oh, and I'm single...so if there's anyone out there that needs a hot boyfriend...keep looking, but whoever wants an average boyfriend, I'm your man!       &nbsp;   Well this past week was prolly one of the best weeks I've had, or will have. It was the United Church of Christ National Youth Event on the campus if the University of Tennessee in Knoxville, and it was a lot of fun. On Tuesday, we all met at Pilgrim Heights in Tama where we got to know eachother and play games and stuff. On Wednesday we loaded two charter buses and left for Indianapolous, Indiana where we stayed the night and messed around at a Great Times place.        &nbsp;   On Thursday we loaded the buses again and set out for Knoxville, at around 5:00 or so, I don't remember when. We were givin the wrong information so we sat around for an hour in front of the wrong dorms. So when we went to eat, they were done serving and we were late to the opening worship and procession of banners, so UT paid for 42 pizzas from Domino's since we didnt get to eat.        &nbsp;   On Friday we had our first workshops and stuff. I hung out with Arik, Staci, and Hannah mostly that day. Then after our first workship we had freetime/sack lunch until 2 then we had another workshop. Then we had free time from 4 to 7 p.m.,&nbsp;me Arik,&nbsp;Hannah, and Staci went to the pool, the girls tanned and me and arik sat in an air conditioned&nbsp;building and watched hot&nbsp;girls.&nbsp;Then we had worship and Christine and Ashley sat by me and we quickly became good friends.       &nbsp;   On Saturday we had opening bible study and stuff, most messed around with Ashley, Christine, and Nate, lol. Then I went to a workshop with Ashley and Christine, it was fun... Then we had lunch again, we just hung out in the dorms and ate pizza and listened to music. That's when Ashley and Christine crimped Jon's hair, it was hilarious, then they made him put on a skirt and a tube top, omg it was great. We didnt have a workshop that afternoon so Ashley, Christine, Nate and I hung for awhile then at the dorms more people joined us and they played cards. Worship again, Ashley and Christine got in trouble for talking, lol, and then there was a Sheltered Reality concert outside our dorms, they're awesome...still.       &nbsp;   Sunday, was the same as every other day, hung out with mostly Chirstine and Ashley (since I'm a big ladies man) and had workshops and shit. Then we had closing worship and we got yelled at by a lady behind us for being too loud and shit, its all good. Then we had closing vespers, the senior's last service, a lot of people cried, but I didnt, i hate crying. Then we loaded the bus and got on the road for home at around 12:45 or 1. Me and Ashley sat together, she slept but i couldnt get to sleep since she was laying on top of me the entire time, lol. But thats okay ;-). After the first&nbsp;stop, I finally got some sleep. At a quarter to 5 we arrived back at Pilgrim Heights, we already dropped people off at I-80 truck stop, and Coralville. I didn't want to go home because I knew I prolly wouldnt see all the cool people I met for a long time...but oh well, have to get back to my worthless boring life sometime.       &nbsp;   Well that's about it...       &nbsp;   -Rosco.        &nbsp;     &nbsp; "
5661,4052552,"17,August,2004",2004-08-17,"    Hey people, what's up? Yesterday was my first day working at Fareway. It went alright, I got the hang of everything already, which is good...right? I got there I had more paperwork to fill out, had to watch a couple movies on safety and shit. Then he took me up front and showed me how to sack groceries, like to put all the frozen shit together, and dont put the bread on the bottom, common sense really. Then he showed me how to properly take the groceries out to the people's cars... Yeah it was ... really exciting. I worked from 10 till 2 and made like...$24 whoo...money, i don't get paid till next Friday tho so that sucks.          Anyways...last night my dad finally decided to tell me that we're going to the Nickelback and Puddle of Mudd concert on Thursday at the Iowa State Fair. So I think me and my parents are going down early to like ... do stuff at the fair or something. And I was just talking to Staci and I guess she wants to go so if she can get there and if my parents dont care we're gonna go together and that'd be awesome. I'd kinda rather go to the concert with Staci than my dad, lol.           So yeah...I have to work tomorrow again...meh...I hope I don't have to follow the manager around again, that's embarrassing...Anyways, I'm bored so I think I'm gonna let you get back to your boring lives...

5662,4052552,"15,August,2004",2004-08-15,"    Hey people, it's me and I've returned from a long weekend at Pilgrim Heights. Lemme fill ya in...          Okay well, Friday morning me and my mom left Humboldt at 6:30a and we headed for Madrid because we had to take my grandma to Mercy West in Des Moines for her knee surgery. We eventually got to Mercy at around 9:15a or so, i dunno. They took her in and stuff. Me, my aunt and my mother sat and watched TV in the waiting room for awhile and then we went out to eat to Cheddar's and I had a huge bacon cheeseburger, omg, the best. Anyhoo...we went back to the hospital and went into the recovery room and talked to gma for awhile and stuff. She was sick from the anesthesia so we had to wait until 2:30p or so before we could take her back to Madrid.          So we got back to Madrid around 3 or so and we sat around for an hour and me and the mother left for Tama. We got there at around 6:30p or so and we unloaded all our stuff into the lodge and headed to Montour to eat at Rube's Steakhouse. Yum...the 16 oz. ribeye is really good. Anyhoo...after that we headed back to the camp and we sat around for awhile and talked and stuff.          The next morning we had breakfast and then the official day to do nothing began. All the adults sat around and talked and shit while me and a couple other kids screwed around by the lake, mostly trying to catch minnows and shit. That night we had a camp fire and the adults sang songs and crap, the little kids had s'mores and I did nothing. Then me, Marcus and Andrew played foosball and ping-pong for a while and stuff.          This morning we had breakfast, blah blah blah and then we had church. After church me and Andrew went out on the lake in a boat and tried catching turtles unsuccessfully. After lunch we went back out for a couple hours and caught a total of 4 painted turtles, it was pretty sweet. We let em go, of course, and then we all left and here I am filling in all you un-interested people. Next year it doesn't look like Marcus and Andrew are gonna get to go so I'm hoping I'll be able to bring Staci maybe since she told me she really wants to go sometime. *shrug*          Anyhoo...tomorrow I start training at Fareway. Ugh. That's gonna suck...but atleast it wont be that busy. ... Yeah ... I can't think of anything to write so I'm gonna let you go. I'll catch ya later.           Adios.      Rosco. "
5663,4052552,"09,August,2004",2004-08-09,"    WHOOO!!!! I just got back from Fareway and they fucking hired me!!! In your face!! This morning Todd from Fareway called me and asked me if I could come and talk to him today and I did and he hired me. But, eh, he made me run up to the courthouse so the Iowa Workforce or w/e could fill out paperwork and shit, then I had to run it back to Todd then he had to fill something out, I had to take it back to the courthouse they had to make copies and shit and then I had to run some more stuff to Todd. Now he has to send all the paperwork to the headquarters in Boone and stuff and he should hear from them by Friday and stuff. Then I have to get trained and stuff...fun stuff.          Anyhoo...last night I decided to talk to Tara. Not about the shit I've done and stuff, but about her and Jon. Her and Jon, Kait's bf, hung out and stuff on Friday night. Supposedly because he doesn't know anybody in Hartley except Tara. Then on Saturday they went to a ... dance. Yeah, that kinda pissed Kait off so last night I decided I would try to get juicy details but I couldn't. She just told me the same stuff that she told Kait. Then we moved on to other stuff...blah blah blah. Then I got off and Staci called me and she was talkin to me about what her and Tara were talking about. They hate eachother again, surprise surprise. I don't care anymore, I'm not in the middle of it anymore, Arik's the bitch now. :-p          So yeah anyways, I'll catch y'all later.           Adios.      Rosco. "
5664,4052552,"07,August,2004",2004-08-07,"    Well I'm bored and have nothing to do so I guess it's rambling time.          Well, first off, Tara deleted her blog so now I don't have to read sappy love notes or whatever anymore. But her last entry was hilarious. She was sayin how there's 4 people that her mom is pissed off at and stuff and that if we even think of coming close to Hartley, we won't hear the end of it from her mother or whatever. Heh. Whoo..another person that hates me...well prolly a whole 'nother -family- that hates me. I'm always the bad guy. *shrug* I don't care, I can go to Hartley if I damn well please, its not like I'm gonna be anywhere near them when I am up there.          Well this morning I had to get up early and work at a car wash at my church to raise money for our mission trip to Hawaii next summer. It was a lot of work and it sucked, mostly the part where I got soked from a hose. Eh. Oh well, it cooled me off. I think we raised like over $400, that's not bad, not bad at all. After that I went out to eat at Chang's with Kait and her family since my family had to go to Omaha to move Jen into her apartment. I was thinkin about goin with them to Omaha but I was thinkin about goin up to Hartley to see Ashley but I havent talked to her in over a week so with my luck she'd be on vacation when I got up there so it wouldn't of been worth it.          Anyways, I've been bored all afternoon with nothing to do...stopped watching the Cubs game because they were losing but now they're ahead so I guess I might go watch the rest of the game. I'll prolly get bored again and I'll end up in front of the computer. So yeah...           Adios.      Rosco. "
5665,4052552,"03,August,2004",2004-08-03,"    Hello people,          I'd first like to address a couple people in my life who I've had hard feelings towards for the past week or so. Tara and Arik. Last night I got into Tara's email account and did some stuff which I regret. I deleted all of her email's she's saved from me, Arik, whoever. I changed her password and her secret question and answer. I also gave Staci the password and she emailed Arik (using Tara's email) and told him some stuff...idk...          Then this morning I got into Tara's AIM account (it was way too easy) I, personally, didn't do anything except sign in once or twice and I didn't talk to a soul using her SN. However, I told Staci her password once again and she did talk to somebody. She pretended she was Tara's mom and talked to Arik. I guess that pissed off Arik and Tara...          I'd like to apologize to Tara for hacking her email and AIM, I dunno why I did it, maybe as revenge for hurting me, idk. I'd also like to apologize for Staci, sometimes she's a little -too- evil and...yeah.          Anyways...I talked to Arik earlier, clearified that it wasnt me he was talking to when he thought he was talking to Tara's mother. I guess our friendship is a -little- better. It's never gonna be like it used to, but it may get better.          Oh yeah, one more thing. Me and Kait are planning on going to Hartley this weekend, Kait wants to see Jon and (dunno why) help him move and stuff. So i figured I could go with her, maybe see Ashley, if I'm lucky. Idk, the parentals will be in Omaha moving Jenny so I wont have anything better to do all day Saturday.          Welp, I better go.           Adios.      Rosco. "
5666,4052552,"02,August,2004",2004-08-02,"    Yes, life still sucks.   My depression is getting a little better since I've talked to Tracy (Tara's friend) about stuff and she was a lot of help. But I guess i'm starting to get sick. Not physically sick. Just sick of some stuff. Mostly Arik and Tara. It seems that they -think- they are in love but face the facts, people. They're 15 years old. Love doesnt exist when you're 15. I've learned from that mistake. I just hope this time, they will too.          I'm also sick of the fact that they have the nerve to say that Staci and I are jealous. Jealous of what? Oh, because they're in love. Uhh...No. We're not saying all this stuff like that they're not gonna last because we're jealous. We're saying it because it's true. People said the same stuff about me and Tara. And they were right. I wish I would've listened earlier.           I can't believe I'm saying this but...I can't wait till school starts. Something to take my mind of all this shit that's going on in my life. Maybe once school starts I can find a -real- girlfriend. Not a girlfriend that's gonna be depressed 24/7 and maybe one thats not gonna run off with my best friend. I can only hope. It'd be nice to have somebody that's a little closer to home. That long distance thing was a mistake. I'm not gonna try that ever again, unless I find a -perfect- girl that I can trust, one that won't come crying to me every 15 minutes because they're depressed. Yeah, I know, far fetched dream, right? Oh well. Maybe some people were meant to be alone.          Adios.      Rosco. "
14558,4053312,"31,July,2004",2004-07-31,"   I want to thank everyone that has posted comments.  Thank you for your words of wisdom.  I have had a lot of questions about how long the surgery will last?  Who is going with me?  Who is watching Brandon and DeeDee?  What hospital?  How long I will be in the hospital?  Here are some answers:  I have been told by someone that has had the surgery that it takes about four hours.  In all of my excitement, I forgot to ask my doctor.  Duh!!!  I have to be at the hospital at 6:00 on the morning of Tuesday, August 3, 2004.  I am leaving from home on Monday night and stay in a hotel in Ocala to be close.  Anyone that knows me, knows that I am not a morning person and this is the best option.  ;-)   I will not be alone.  My very dear, supportive, and loving friend Carlos will be with me from the time I leave home until the time I return home.  He has been going to Ocala for doctor's visits up to this point.  He has been in this with me from almost the very beginning giving me informaiton to help me decide what procedure I wanted to pursue.  I feel that I am in capable hands.  With GOD's help he will take care of me.  So, don't worry.  My mother will be at home with Brandon and DeeDee.  I have not told them yet.  I am still not sure if I will, but knowing my very nurtring mother, she will think of something if I don't.  I just want them to know how very much I love them, and that they are my motiviation for doing this.  Here is the hospital informaiton: Ocala Regional Medical Center 1431 SW 1st Avenue P.O.Box 2200 OcalaFL  34478 Telephone: (352) 401-1000  I am suppose to be in the hospital for three days.  I am hoping to be back home by Friday or Saturday.  If you want to know how I am doing, you can call the hospital and talk to Carlos or me if I am up to it or call my mother at home.  I am excited.

13210,4055095,"27,July,2004",2004-07-27,"   Hmmm, after thinking about this whole blog thing, I realized the similarities between the relationship of our lives with the internet and the Borg from Star Trek: TNG.  The internet is this big storage compartment of facts, news, ideas, opinions and so much more.  And with the advent of the blog, it's now become this depository of people's thoughts.  So is the internet becoming a collective brain for the entire world?       If I need to know something, I go to the internet.  I usually Google it.  Not too long ago, if you needed to know, say, the weather, you had to wait until the 10 o'clock news came on (or look out the window).  Of course, the Weather Channel changed that, kind of.  You still had to wait until they displayed the weather you were interested in, but it was better, nonetheless.  Now with the internet, I can find out the weather instantly.  The same thing applies to other info like phone numbers, addresses, driving directions, news, whatever.  The internet has provided this collective area to find all this info.       Now, think about personal computing devices and where we're headed with them.  I personally use a PDA on a daily basis.  It was a godsend for helping me remember stuff for work.  My PDA doesn't have wireless capability, though.  I didn't have any use for it and didn't want to shell out the extra money for it.  But all of the newest PDA's automatically come with wireless capabilities whether you want them or not.  So you can surf the internet anywhere, provided you can find a WiFi hot spot.  You can have access to this collective of information at any time.       I'm sure personal computing devices will continue to change and adapt to our needs.  With that said, is it too much of a stretch to think of everyone in the world who has access to this seemingly infinite brain (the internet), sharing their thoughts and ideas and experiences, so they all, in essence are sharing the same big life or same big brain?  Sort of brings us all together doesn't it?  Gives more meaning to the idea that we are all part of the same whole.  Which is why I compare the idea to the Borg.  They are many parts of a greater consciousness.  All of their thoughts are one.  No, I don't expect us to all lose our identities and individual thoughts.  But it is interesting that we can all converge in this one cyberspace.  "
13211,4055095,"27,July,2004",2004-07-27,"   Here's the maiden voyage of my blog.  I've heard of blogs for awhile now, but really haven't looked too much into what they were.  Of course, I'm always interested in reading other people's random thoughts.  So why shouldn't I share all the mundane crap that goes on in my life as well?       Work went well today.  Lots to do and not enough time to do it in.  We have 2 people out of the office, so we're short handed.  But we're not hurting.  I work in the County Clerk's Office and we're currently looking at changing the way we archive records.  For decades, we've used microfilm.  That's worked just fine except that our microfilm camera is as old as the hills and we are in desperate need of a new system.  So rather than buy a new microfilm camera, we're going to start living in the 21st century and switch to ""imaging"".  We'll be scanning the documents that are filed with us and storing them as digital images on the computer.  I am so excited because I'm a total computer nerd and this is right up my alley.       I've been experimenting with a scanning system for the past week and although it's simplistic in comparison to other systems that are out there, I am very impressed with the image quality and potential for what we can do with these scanned images.  Right now, if you come into my office and ask for a copy of a document, we have to make a copy from microfilm and it may not look that great because the filmer might not have checked it that well.  Or the microfilm may show some aging.  But digital images will never degrade!  Plus I can make you a copy of a document without getting my backside up out of my chair!  :)  Am I lazy?       Another benefit from going to digital imaging is the storage room we can reclaim.  Right now, our office is overrun with huge books from the late 1800's and early 1900's.  Then we have many cabinets full of microfilm.  If we can convert all that (eventually) to digital images, we'd have more room for the new cases that are filed with us.       Upon coming home from a nice, busy day at the office, I was greeted by an almost paved road.  The County is working to have our road repaved and buddy, it needed it!  It's had so many potholes for years.  They'd usually just come out and patch them up.  And we all know what happens to a patch job on a road.  It lasts what, two months tops?  At any rate, we're finally getting a brand new re-surfaced road.  Yay!       I also received a message that a friend of mine had her appendix removed today.  Apparently she began hurting yesterday (on her birthday of all days).  She went to a hospital in a city that I know nothing about.  I'd like to go see her, but I'm afraid I'll get lost.  She's supposed to get out tomorrow night, so I don't feel so bad about not seeing her.  I'll check with her when she gets back.  Poor girl.  She's had more bad luck with health.  First she was diagnosed with Crone's Disease, then just recently got over a bout with Pneumonia and then some bronchial problem and now she's gotta deal with this.  Good grief!  I'd certainly understand if she were to get depressed.  I know I would be.  But she still keeps going!  I'm glad she has the will power to keep going.  "
13212,4055095,"16,August,2004",2004-08-16,"   The walls are thin in the apartment complex that I live in.  They're not too bad, but sometimes I can hear my neighbor's TV and one night he kept me awake until 2:00 am having a party.  He was unresponsive to my beats on the wall.  My neighbor is relatively new (less than 6 months).  He acts as if he's the only person living in the building.  He always seems to wake me up somehow, whether it's talking on his cell phone right outside my bedroom window or having his friend pick him up at 5:00 am and they honk their horn to announce their arrival.      This evening I heard the typical ""TV noise"" coming from next door again.  But this time, it sounded louder than usual.  So I couldn't resist.  I had to see what this guy could be watching so loudly over there.  I did it.  I stuck my ear to the wall.  But I quickly realized that I wasn't listening to his TV.  I was listening to him berating his son.  When you live in an apartment, you kind of gather how your neighbors' lives work just by seeing them come and go on a daily basis.  Although I don't know him personally and have never spoken to him (wouldn't want to anyway, the jerk), I've gathered that he's probably divorced and gets custody of his son periodically.  I've seen them coming back from the swimming pool and getting in to his truck.  His son looks about three or four years old.      As I listened to him I realized that his son was crying.  Then it sounded like the guy was mocking his son.  He kept asking him something, maybe he was asking his son why he was crying.  I heard the boy say something unintelligible and then the guy said something like ""I didn't call you a girl, I said you were acting like one"".  There were some words said that I couldn't quite make out.  Then I heard the boy crying pretty hard, in that sort of scream/cry that small children do when they're upset.  He was crying out ""daddy"" over and over again.  I have no idea if the guy was hurting his child physically, but I certainly don't approve of the verbal abuse I heard.  Some people may not think anything of it, but I think verbal abuse (no matter how mild) is just as bad as physical abuse.      I didn't like the idea that he was telling his son he was acting like a girl.  Being a gay man and growing up in a society, religion and town that pressured me to hide who I was makes me especially mad when I hear fathers calling their sons names because they might be doing something that they find feminine.  Besides, what's so feminine about crying for God's sake?  He's a child!  That's what children do (and newsflash... that's was mature adults do) when they're upset.      Right after I heard the boy calling out ""daddy"" over and over again, my phone rang and it was my sister.  I unloaded on her (lucky her) and she gave me some reassuring advice.  She's a nurse and said she's had to call Child Protective Services on many people when she sees certain circumstances in her hospital.  I don't know if I should call CPS or not.  I'm going to wait because I have no proof that anything happened other than the child was upset.  Maybe the boy was cranky and tired and they weren't getting along with each other.  I know I've gotten upset with my nephew when he was really young and wouldn't stop crying (of course I didn't call him names).  It's only natural to lose your cool sometimes, but I didn't like the way the guy seemed to be mocking his son.  Doesn't he realize that children look up to their parents and copy everything they do?  I catch my nephew trying to do everything I do and everything his mom and dad does.  That's why we have to try to be good examples for him so he hopefully won't develop the same bad habits that we have.  I realize I can't save everybody and that verbal and physical abuse go on daily.  But it makes me sick to think about it.  This guy has no business having a child.  I won't even go into the fact that the guy is basically a child himself.  He's still immature.  He has friends over late on the weekends and they drink and are generally loud.  He'll come home at 4:00 in the morning sometimes.  This was probably an unwanted pregnancy and now he feels trapped in this situation and maybe feels resentment toward the child.      I'm going to keep an eye and an ear out and if I have to call CPS, I guess I'll have to call them.  I just didn't want to be the nosy neighbor who won't mind his own business.  But a child's well being may depend on it.  "
13213,4055095,"01,August,2004",2004-08-01,"   Well then, just this past Thursday in my office (remember I work in our local County Clerk's Office), we had a man come in who was wanting help with his property.  We're familiar with the man.  He comes in periodically and gets copies of his Service Discharge.  I don't know what he does with all those copies, we simply indulge him.  You can tell that he has some sort of mental condition.  Perhaps he was in a war and has mental damage from having to cope with it or something like that.  Who knows?  You can just tell, usually, which customers have mental disorders once they begin talking to you.  We don't treat these people any differently.  We try to help them the best we can, but a few of them are too far away from reality, haven't been taking their medication, or maybe haven't been fortunate enough to be able to seek medical help for their condition.  I don't feel we should fear people who are like this because I think it could happen to anybody and I wouldn't want people treating me badly because I wasn't making sense.  I feel like we should treat them with as much respect as possible, but there are lines that can be crossed.      Back to the man who was asking for help with his property...  Everyone in the office noticed he was being much more ""wordy"" than he usually is.  He usually says very, very little.  But then again, we always know what he's coming after (his Service Discharge), so he doesn't need to say anything except for how many copies he wants.  The girl who was helping him seemed to be trying to find what he needed, but she wasn't doing exactly what he wanted.  After he walked out, obviously agitated, the girl told us what had happened.  She said that he was complaining that the co-owner of his property was trying to take the property away from him and he needed to know how to get the co-owner's name off of the deed.  Well, our default answer for that question is ""you need to seek legal advice from an attorney"".  The County Clerk's Office is not there for legal advice and to explain what documents mean or how to go about transferring titles, etc.  The County Clerk's Office is essentially the library for the County.  We store things and keep records and can retrieve what you need if you tell us what you're looking for.  But people expect us to know all about property transactions and Probate proceedings.  And they expect us to be able to explain all the ins and outs about how they work, etc.  We know the things that pertain to our office and that's it.  If we knew all the other extra stuff, then we'd be freakin' attorneys for God's sake.  But you don't see us charging people $150 an hour while they're standing at our counter wanting service.      The man didn't like the ""you need to talk to an attorney"" answer.  He also proceeded to tell the clerk about some incident where the police came into his home.  He was mad about that and I guess wanted her to do something about that as well.  When she couldn't help him, he said ""then you're going to get shot"" and left.      We were on edge for the rest of the day wondering if this man was going to come back into our office with a gun.  We've actually had another man who has a mental disorder come up to our office with a gun and was caught outside in the parking lot with it.  (That guy had a history of threatening people, but usually with stupid idol threats.)  Our courthouse security was on alert and we constantly had an officer within our sight.  Our bailiffs are outstanding for responding to problems and I am thankful that they're in the courthouse with us.      With that said, I wonder why our County spent all the money that it did on remodeling the courthouse and putting in extra security measures for the judges, yet didn't bother with remodeling our office and added no extra security measures for us other than installing a panic button.  Mind you, I'm thrilled about the panic button and as I've stated, our bailiffs are great at responding.  But the judges are locked away in rooms that require you to enter a code to open the door.  And in their courtrooms, they've had bulletproof shields installed on their benches so they can duck behind them if a defendant happens to bring a gun to court (or get a gun off of a bailiff).      I don't want to be locked away behind some door with a push-button lock.  We're supposed to be there for public service.  But what do we do if someone comes in with a gun?  We've discussed this in our office and asked each person what would they do.  Of course, you can never know exactly what your reaction will be if something like that happens (unless you've been trained, like law enforcement).  Perhaps we need to devise a plan in case something like that happens.  I've personally been in a threatening situation where a girl was attacked in my front yard at 2:00 a.m. and she came to my house for help.  I reacted in a completely different way than I thought I would.  I wasn't thinking clearly and was scared.      I'm not trying to diminish the potential threat to the judges.  I know they're the ones who dish out the punishment to criminals and who rule against people or take people's kids away from them.  So they really piss people off.  I completely understand why they would feel threatened.  I just feel like we clerks aren't taken seriously.  As if we don't matter.  We deal with the people.  And for the most part, the people are calm, cool and collected and we can help them with what they need.  But our door is also open to the person who's not in the best mental state.      I suppose there are no guarantees.  Perhaps I'm asking for too much.  After all, I'm not guaranteed to return home safely when I leave my home to go to Wal-Mart.  I could be hit by a drunk driver or someone could go ballistic in the store.  After a few weeks, the threatening incident will be pushed to the backs of our minds and we won't be so worried.  But when things like that happen, they make you stop and think about how easily we can lose the life we've been given.  "
13214,4055095,"01,August,2004",2004-08-01,"   Stayed up til almost 2:00 a.m. this morning (I never stay up that late).  I went to my sister's house and watched a movie with her, her husband and our nephew (who was in town visiting a friend).  We watched ""Go"" again.  My sister loves that movie.      Ever woke up and felt like someone has beaten the crap out of you?  That's the way I've been feeling the past couple of mornings.  I've slept really hard and probably didn't move an inch all night long.  But then when I wake up in the morning, I feel all haggard like I could probably sleep some more.  Yet I can't go back to sleep.  So off I go in inject my body with Starbucks Breakfast Blend.      After getting out of bed, I decided to pay a couple of bills and get those out of the way.  Rent's due today, but since it's Sunday, I won't get it to them until tomorrow.  I'm now paying all of my bills online, with the exception of one.  It's such a breeze.  And I no longer have to worry about whether or not our wonderful postal service will get my payments to their appropriate destinations.  I don't mean to knock the U.S. post office because considering the sheer amount of mail they handle daily and the low cost of mailing a letter, overall they do a great job.  But I've been screwed one too many times by the postal service to warrant my distrust.  The only bill I can't pay online is my car payment and that sucks.  Bank One won't allow me to do online payments unless I have a checking account with them.  Whatever.      After paying those two bills, I was a little surprised to see my checking account getting kinda low.  I'm not saying I'm rich or anything because I definitely am not.  But I like to keep a little bit of a ""padding"" in my checking account, just in case.  Not too much, just a few hundred extra dollars.  (I was able to do this by cashing in my 401k when I quit a previous job.  I was young, what did I know about 401k's?)  I think I've indulged a bit too much now.  My padding is slowly wearing away!  It's making me think hard about whether I really need to be paying $24.00 a month for Netflix.  Once you get used to living with certain luxuries, it's hard to go back.  You begin to feel as though you need them and can't live without them.  I've forgotten what it is like to live without broadband internet or movies being mailed to me.  I've become spoiled (or more spoiled than what I was).  "
8653,4055499,"01,August,2004",2004-08-01,"    I was noticing today how whenever there is any fuss, hummingbirds just rise up and float away, like that sweet nectar is nothing to them next to the uncomplicated virtue of silence, like theyâ€™d rather just be alone in the world without the mess of noise, other than the clapping of their own small wings, waiting patiently for their next chance at sweetness.  This must be why theyâ€™re so small.  Today I was walking around the city, trying to find the law library.  In Indiana the buildings are so close together and situated on these very neat and even planes with each other.  There arenâ€™t people on the streets or sidewalks that arenâ€™t students, visitors, or professors of the University, but here there are thousands of people going about their every day lives, totally separate from students.  It occurred to me that I had been on the same street as the law library so many times before.  Last winter my mother and I went to see a show at The Playhouse Square, which happens to be right next to the law library.  We were running through this thick December rain to try to find a restaurant to eat at before the show and we accidentally witnessed the lighting of the Christmas tree.  We stood there for a moment, pretending like we had meant to see it, like we planned it and it was special even though it was something that we would never really do. Still, it was the surprise of it all, the mystery of being caught in an unintended moment.  Not knowing something was there and then becoming a part of the history of it.  So, seeing the law library was a surprise, but I didnâ€™t feel anything that magical.  In fact, with everyone walking around wearing business suits, or tracksuits, or baseball caps looking for the early opening hot dog vender, I felt pretty unremarkable.  This must be a familiar feeling to many students downtown, because it seems like there are extra steps taken to make students feel special in their education.  For example today I received my university ID card.  The man at the desk told me that I could do â€œanythingâ€ with the card.  Anything? I thought, but didnâ€™t say it because I thought I would hurt his feelings.  But now I have this green card in my wallet.  It is in the third position behind my Driverâ€™s License and my debit card, so maybe it is special.  But then, when I was walking outside back to my car, I saw a group of about ten students who attended the College of Court Reporting.  They all had these great book bags with this golden shimmering seal that said â€œCollege of Court Reporting.â€  At that moment I kind of wished that I were going there, so that I could get the bag.  But instead of making a fuss, I just rose up and floated away.   "
8654,4055499,"01,August,2004",2004-08-01,"    when i was running this morning i was thinking how odd it is to pass by houses as people are just starting the day.  everyone is so locked into the becoming of the day, the routine of it.  i feel like such an intruder on their lives.  for example this morning there was a woman wearing a blueberry nightgown holding a long yellow rope which ended on a collar of a golden retriever.  she just looked at me as if i were a spy and i smiled letting her know that i didn't care that her dog was barking at me, that if my dog was there he'd bark at her too.  after that i got to a man who was walking out to the mailbox to fetch his newspaper.  it was almost eight in the morning and everyone was speeding down Lake road to get to work on time.  still, he didn't mind that he only had his boxers on.  he was that confident, that comfortable i thought.  but when i got closer, he turned around and pretended to look at the lake, at the storm coming in.  it was such an awkward thing to do, and he knew it.  but he wasn't ready for me to say ""goodmorning"" or to catch a wave coming from me, so he did it.  it wasn't part of his routine.  anyway maybe i don't feel like a spy as much as i feel guilty for feeling so mellow in those moments.  if it were the other way around i would probably turn to the lake as well.  maybe that's why some people are runners.  maybe that's why i am.

8655,4055499,"01,August,2004",2004-08-01,    and that blog was a beautiful blog&nbsp;     
8656,4055499,"01,August,2004",2004-08-01,"    I have been away from Ohio for six years and finally moved back this summer.  Every day that I was away, I longingly remembered one thing about this little part of the world.  Itâ€™s not something that inspires the illustrious painters of nature or the romantic bards that croon of the greatest of lakes.  Itâ€™s the gray, cloud-covered waters; the sky, whispering a secret of rain, like at any moment, real silver may fall.  Today was the first day that I found the weather again and I am so happy for it.  August and mysteriously cool, the temperature low enough for me to wear a tee shirt and a fleece.  But itâ€™s the water that really gets under my skin something wickedly happy.  There could be nothing and everything out there and I would never know.  And I donâ€™t need too.  The clouds are so low that the little white caps forming in the coming storm from Canada look like they might just grab them and pull them into some secret chamber.  And the sky between the clouds is a permanent muted pink, even though the sun is no nearer to setting.  All of the kingdom of things feels this weather I think, because I can hear them buzzing violently outside in their bushes and stalks, stems and blades.  All this while, the fattest lake gull I have ever seen sits fixed on the top of the dock light.  Every minute or so he barks at the waves, daring them to knock him from his perch, spit him on his back.  Itâ€™s been over three hours and heâ€™s still there.  Heâ€™s an Ohio bird for sure.  He wonâ€™t move away for anything.   "
8657,4055499,"01,August,2004",2004-08-01,"    My house sounds like a broken cat.  I know it looks like I meant to write â€˜carâ€™ and then fell victim to a typo, but I meant cat.  There is a strange noise that is always just outside of my dining room window.  I canâ€™t figure it out and it grates at me all day long while Iâ€™m writing.  Sometimes I think it is the ghost of dead wood.  This house is old.  Built in the 20s when Ohio was full of industry from the lake and coal from the electric rail cars.  But something is purring outside, a miserable sigh.  Like it wants me to find something out about this place that I didnâ€™t know about before today, or the day before, or a week ago when I first heard it.  The crickets have started now, their dress rehearsal for evening.  The broken cat has left, for now.  Perhaps it is soothed by the metronomic high pitched thud of the crickets.  Maybe not.  Today when I was on my run, I was nearly assassinated by a wasp.  I must have looked crazed, running in the bicycle lane, swatting at my back with my hands.  And the faster that I ran, the more quickly my swats swirled around my head, and I eventually tangled myself completely in my earphone wires.  But I didnâ€™t slow down.  The wasp followed me and I didnâ€™t slow down, I just ignored her.  After about three minutes, I was far enough away from the scent of her hive and she went back to her flowers where she felt safe.  I am so glad that Fall is coming with all of its teeth.  The crickets have stopped and whatever swinging broken thing is back.  I should stop writing now and move away from the window, so I can ignore the sound for another day.   "
8658,4055499,"01,August,2004",2004-08-01,"    Today the lake is high.  The waves come right over the pier and slam into the neighborâ€™s patio with such lonely vigor â€“ because theyâ€™ve been cheated out of their right to curl and fall on land rather than cement.  Today I saw a woman digging in the ground.  From far away it looked like she was making a giant gray cake, mixing something and then smoothing the tops with her large shovel.  But when I got closer to her I realized that she was actually evening what she dug so that she could lay a sidewalk.  I thought to myself, why canâ€™t I lay a sidewalk?  because I couldnâ€™t.  I donâ€™t have the patience for that kind of evenness.  And anyway I would rather there be a little hill or two in it, which wouldnâ€™t make anyone happy but me and some kid who just got his first skateboard.  Maybe weâ€™d be enough.   "
8659,4055499,"01,August,2004",2004-08-01,"    After six last night, the sun was still unrelenting.  It was insistent, remorseless heat slapping my left cheek, as I, equally unwavering, sat atop the breaker wall and watched the sun sink like silk to the West.  There were two pelicans floating in the water.  They let the waves play with their little bodies in a way that made them look wooden.  And then, they just flew away.  A white gull came and they leapt out of the water, their long wings like robes, vestments of conviction, following her in wide circles like a Queen.  I couldnâ€™t help but smile to watch them in the water.  They seemed wholly, absolutely amazed that they were able float.  I wish I could have stayed out there and watched them disappear into the broken light of the West, but the sun was more patient that I, and the heat was getting me.  The sound of the coughing water, the lake doveâ€™s high-toned screams, the small bumblebees making their love, all of the smells of what was alive and dead or alive again in the lake.  These things were small enough for me to find amazing.  After a long night of dreaming of them, I woke to the Lake barking under the kick of lightning.  Clouds, waves, rains.  But no pelicans.  And no sun.   "
8660,4055499,"01,August,2004",2004-08-01,"    i've been slipping back into my dreams in the morning when the road shudders underneath my feet.  even when i'm running and listening to some nonsense from idiot disc jockeys corporate radio hires to ensure the image of young twenty somethings as dumb fucks with barely an appreciation for a beat to back up the one coming from their chests.  even then.  and the dreams come and suddenly that song ""lucky man"" from the verve comes too and the river of air is everywhere.  even in the heat.  even there on that gravel road that is slowly destroying my knees.  because i've been thinking about how i say goodbye.  it's never more appropriate to muse over such a topic than when i'm running.  or maybe it's because the light is just coming and despite the traffic pushing me off the road, i only hear the lake.  recently i've been dreaming of past loves, lost friends.  and there is always something birdlike about them.  and when i say birdlike i mean that there is something mythical.  one person was a giant, another had the strength of athena.  and they were all coming back into my life to say hello.  people i had all run from.  those that received a sudden goodbye.  and i've created this odyssey but without any heroes.  and whiles i'm running i start feeling so full of fire, so full of fatal flaws.  still i keep running because all goodbyes should be sudden, i think.  or maybe i just run because it's all i know.   "
2890,4056798,"31,July,2004",2004-07-31,"   Well, its me back again from San Francisco. A lot happened there, not a lot of big things but a lot. So the last day of school, i got A's on both of my finals and we got our grades, an A too, second highest in the class, my brother is first highest. Another thing: We were the only two to get A's in the class. And you wondered why i couldnt update! So..it was really sad leaving and i have pictures on my website now! I know! i konw it seems like forever! But the thing is...i love these pictures and there in perfect organization. Links and everything. Much love to Zack and to Sarah, and to Mr. Parrot and to Alex and Chi Chi and Yue-Cheng, and Paige...we all love you doll! So...anyways we went to San Francisco where they (the dentists) became happy with sticking very scary sharp objects in my mouth and things that were really loud. I really didnt like it and i kept thinking i was going to faint. I just get like that. So then after that we went to our house in Daly City, all peachy. And then the house in San Francisco...very nice little (NOT!) house there. The renters are keeping it nice. Then t buy groceries where last time i went with my dad we saw this guy that played on the Kings basket ball...could get his Autograph though...Grrr : (. Anyways...then we got our haircut! You would love my hair...its so tiny and with my glasses i look like a freaking genius!!! Anywhoo! So...then we went and ate and this is the funny part. I was totally bored...stuffed to the brim about to fall asleep and this guy comes in with this other guy... I dont know, friends or something....so then what happened is that i went to go use the restroom it was a two hour drive back home. So...i went and when i came back i stared at the guy. He had a freaking bible with him and he had glassed that were plastic like mine. So i stared at him and i guess he thought i thought he was hot, which he SO was not. So anyways...he stared at me and smiled and said something. I didnt understand so i just kinda smiled at him. I sat down and then i realized he had said ""Hey precious."" Freaky deaky. I walked out of the resteraunt with my mom cause my dad was eating fish and that takes forever in a day. So...then what happened was my mom and i were about to cross the street when these gang bangers go by and they throw a glass bottle on the floor. It exlodes and i kinda take a step back. What idiots. Oh yeah, earlier i had seen this hobo women with a REAL Louis Vuitton bag, i personally thought it was hillarious. Cause she goes around with like dirty pants begging for money and she looks like she gonna die and in her hand a huge ass Louis Vuitton bag that costs more than she will ever have...she was holding it like it was her life. So..today i woke up with a fat headache, rememberd i was going Sushi-ing with Alexandra and Poof there goes my headache! So...we went to Sushi...i ate WAY to much. So much i thought i was gonna puke afterward. And the fact that we went out after for a cup of coffee that wasnt really a cup cause it was a venti white chocolate mocha from starbucks ( i cant believe i tossed it!!!) made me nearly gag. So...with the coffee in hand, cool haircut, neat glasses, loose faded jeans, carefree walk and black UCD sweater....we entered this hip little music store and sat down to listen to music, we were some fly little crackers! i felt totally sophisticated until i thought i was gonna puke. All the raw fish got to me. Oh yeah, huh! We went to Maren's mom store...a little funky. There was this TINY purse smaller than my palm and it had 20 on it. I went up to buy it...i mean tiny little purse made out fake leather...come one. twenty cents right? It was fity percent off. Of from 40 cents. I go up with my dollar...guess what? Its twenty bucks cause its ""From Italy"" Shoot man...i can kill me a cow in italy, make crappy purses, dye them, ship them over to the US and sell em for over a hundred bucks. These people are f-ing CRAZY! Not to mention they have a door smack in the middle of the damn store cause it shows off the too expensive hangers. Ridiculous. So...then after the music store, we went to the Salvation army...it was really cool. Even though it stunk so bad...there was some really good books. Then we went to go watch The Village. The movie...its not that bad, but if youre looking to get scared...dont go watch it. So anyways..after that...we went to Gap and we tried on some skirts and some pants and i found these pants...low on the waist cropped pants. THEYRE MINE! fifty bucks and this cute little hat and scarf...my birthdays coming up...*clears throat* Mommy, daddy? Wanna add that to the one hundred shopping spree at Pac Sun and the brand new dell labtop? Please...so anyways then we went to borders and we read some and then i came back home plopped down and watched Starsky and Hutch...hillarious and then im going downstairs to finish off the night with The Godfather one...i think i know my daddys new birthday gift... the godfather. Why are all guys obsessed with that damn movie anyways? So...heres to me and my two and half weeks of summer!!! You all know you love me!  "
2891,4056798,"29,July,2004",2004-07-29,"   Well, today is done meaning only one more day of school which is a total blast for me! I cant wait till its done except for the fact that then i wont be able to see those people again which makes me really sad! I really love these people! All of them...okay minus one or two or three or four or five or six...you get my point. Anyways Zack is getting nicer and sweeter and more into my personal bubble space. Alex is being a dumb ass he likes to take and touch people. He enjoys coming up to you and touching you. Touching your hair and your hands and your face and anything on your face and other things. he enjoys to take your things. Pencils, erasers, journals, books. Freaky huh? Well bryant didnt make it. He went to UCD Library, or he went to the MU. And he stood there and stayed there i suppose for too long. Like he left or something. I feel really bad i kinda didnt want to hop on the bus. He is all by himself over there....i feel awful! Anyways...tomorrow there is another final. Today there was a final, it was kinda sad though. Because you know what? There were only three questions on the test. The test was worth a hundred points, and talk about disaster if you missed one of the questions...!! Ouch! Anyways...tomorrow another final. I have a damn 88% in the stupid class. Im doing ec today...and a kick ass job in the test tomorrow. I mean hey, last time i came out with a 100% on the midterm. Who says i cant pull it off again? Zack was being awfully funny today. He stole my cell phone several times and then he sat on me and he yelled at two people who were making out to get a room...lol. What a doll! Anyways, i must go! Wish me Luck!  "
2892,4056798,"28,July,2004",2004-07-28,"   Dont we all love Barbie? Yeah...id say. Id write a lot except for the fact that i already wrote a lot but deleted most of it. Actually all of it. i think that being a webdesigner has gotten to my head. Anyways i am free in two days. So this freaky deaky mexican girl asked my brother to go with him. Well not go with him, like she wrote a note to stephanie her mexican friend and in it she said that she wanted to go with bryant...like date him. Freaky huh? It scares me to think that she wants to go with bryant. Which brought me to think...if my dad thought it was cute and funny that she wanted to go with bryant...what would he think about me? So i told him and then he stayed quiet and he said ""What?"" and then i started laughing and said just joking! Isnt that so unfair? my parents said that they would kill the guy who would want to date me! Lol, i find that kinda funny. SO i talked to paige today, shes a real doll! Lol, no pun intended! She is really sweet and not all that pretty but she has a face that you have to look twice at. like literally. She is just...so interesting. I love it. So anyways, the doll (lol) started to talk to me about highschool and stuff and how great it was and how i should take this class and that class and this and that. I loved it! No one except for her barbie guards can talk to her. I loved it! She was awfully nice until Zack started to bug her! Isnt Zack so cute! Anyways...it turns out that she is mexican and that she speaks spanish fluently. Yeah..thats right. She understands everything that we say! Uh-Oh! Anyways...people think that im half chinese. Im sorry but these people are just screwed up! I cant believe them...me chinese? They have the weirdest impression of asian people. They probably thought i was asian cause i was on top of everything...like knowing all the answers...thats how asians are. Always the best...its the truth, i know tons of people who want to break that style. But no...not me im not asian. Im full bred italian and spanish. You know you love me though!  "
2893,4056798,"27,July,2004",2004-07-27,"   Its so lovely to be one with the computer! its even better knowing that i will be able to go on the computer for the rest of my life and that in just three days i wil be able to go and work on my website. So, today Zach and i got to giggling like crazy. The father figure was upset with us. He was really clingy though and we were cracking up about capitol barbie. The truth of the matter is. That i see so much of her in me. Or me in her. Something  like that. I just see so much becuase you know what? the truth is that if i were in her position i would act like her. I talked to her with bryant today. Shes okay, tells the truth. She got three percent higher than i did on the test. Its okay, i wont kill her for it. I still love her like crazy. lol. Well anyways, i really should be going, working on homework. Schools almost out so that means new layout! Isnst that nifty? Anyways...new layout most probably. But without paintbrushes...im ultimetly nothing! (Spelling) Love you mucha!  "
2894,4056798,"08,August,2004",2004-08-08,"   Well nothing has happened lately...i have been awfully bored and doing nothing at all. Ive been sleeping a lot lately. Jo has gotten back today! Im so happy..but i cant pick her up, gabby's back from LA to and next friday im going major shopping with mommy! I almost have fifty buckaroos to buy those very cool Gap Capris. Woke up at five today to deliver news papers...must feed cat. Pellet has been getting Pissed off lately. We cleaned out the garage last night, i cleaned out the bird bath and Cindy asked me to baby sit! Money Money! My b-day is coming up soon to! Hurrah!!! HURRAH! im almost fifteen and school is almost starting. im blabbing like crazy...so please dont think im weird. Well...love you...but must run! BYE!  "
2895,4056798,"01,August,2004",2004-08-01,"   Well..its the first of the month...exciting huh? Not really that just means that its closer to school starting all over again. Really sad, i know...im actually really depressed...i wish that i could be back at summer school with all my friends...i really miss them all. I mean it would be nice to get in a get together again..im listening to Faith Hill, ""Breathe"" Exciting stuff huh? I love Davis and all, but it has NOTHING on San Francisco...i wish i were in San Francisco. I love San Francisco, its all i have. Its the only thing that i know that i can hold onto it. And then ofcourse some damn terrorists will come and blow it all up. I have to go...i dont really want to write right now...im probably gonna go finsish a layout i started and never finished. Okay then...and then code dolls again...i miss all my friends so much! I want jo and kristin back and zack and jennifer...i dunno.  "

His name is qi xiang, in del's class and also huimin's friend from her sec school(i think).  well, talking about guys, i miss Him sooo much ... dunno whether he has returned back to Germany already ... think he should have been back already and preparing to start school ... haiz ... cant wait till the end of the year to go and see him !!!! hahaha ... think i am going mad soon!!!! haha ...

Hopes she keeps her words. anyway, i am feeling much better. sorry if i offended anybody just now ... i was damn fraustrated and about to cry(i think i did). Anyway, going to go home and attempt to study cause most of the mock exams are approaching and i dun wanna fail ... haiz!!!  anyway, now, huimin's project seems to have conked up, and she is back at her usual mood again ... dunno it is the how many time already ... i sort of really admire darren for being able to take it. I am already quite tolerant, and i and starting to get irritated at her more often. shumin seems also to be getting pretty short-tempered. I dunno whether it is the influence of huimin, or if she is already like that.haiz!!! "

Sometimes, i think that i really am being taken granted of !!!! they dun seem to care about me!!!! i sometimes think whether do i deserve such treatment or not. Take the VB for  example , huimin and shumin only seem to care that as long as their project is done, then that's all. What about me? They have completed the project, but i haven!!!! They wanna leave already ... but i haven even gotten anywhere in the project, and i am getting sick of this project already!!!!! arghh!!!!  i seriously think i am gonna flunk this freaking course and disappoint everyone in this entire world!!!!

I feel that most of my poly friends take me for granted, when they actually dun like me ... and i dunno , but i just feel like shit now ... I am very happy for Bel, but i dun know if this will cause us to drift apart, by the fact that we are both now in different polys and my class time tables are now diferent. We dun get to talk much, wad more hang out with one another. HAaiz!!!! Really missed 4F!!!!! Sometimes, i dun know wad to look forward to going to school for, sometimes, when i dun even understand wad the lecturer is talking about or how to work those equipments!!!! Argh!!!! "
8906,4060812,"12,August,2004",2004-08-12,"   Hey!!! Today is Saturday and i met up with my TK friends!!! Woah!!! So Happy!!!! I missed them sooo much!!! Haha!!!! Anyway, went to school early today, at about 9, maybe. Tried to do that freking visual programming thing, but didnt get far on it!!! So frustrating!!!   Anyway, left school at about 12, rushed over to Orcard to look for the guys!!! Met them at Breeks!!! Bhavna, Bel, Kesh and Nurfarhana. Di and del was not there yet !!! Missed them man!!! Haven seen these guys for like at least 2 â€“ 3 months ... HAHA!!! Anyway, didnt have a great lunch, was okay la ... everyone was sooo slim and pretty, made me feel like shit sia ... must go on diet sia ... hmmp!!! Proceeded to Paragon to watch MJC perform ... i0t was actually pretty lousy cause the music was sooo damn soft and the moves werent that great either, but wadever!!! Anyway, met some of 4F ppl. So glad to see them, felt like hugging them too but didnt dare ... haiz!!! Met sham, ks, and i think thats about all.   Oh ya, i dun know why, but i always feel like a freaking lamp-post whenever arund Darren and Huimin. They always seem to want me to be around, but i feel out of the place. Haiz, i think i am fated to be a match-maker for life sia ... first Feli and Yongsheng, now Darren and Huimin. Well, hope that things will turn out great for these 2 couples, especially between Darren and Huimin, or not have to step in and help. Its not that i mind, but i hope that it would be solved between themselves.   Another thing, i dunno why, but it seems that the group is like going to offically break lor. I dun seem to be talking to Daisy and Feli anymore. We dun seem to have anything to talk about, althoug we used to have lots to talk about!!! Well, maybe this will turn out to be the best for everyone!!! Anyway, Tg will be going to TW for some com comp., will miss him, but only as a friend. Istill dun understand how he can be mistaken that i like him. Haiz!!! Just let it pass la ... Thatâ€™s how life is, i guess.   Tests are coming soon, and i think i better start studying hard or i am sooo gonna fail man!!! I dunno whether it is because the course is not my knid or is it that i just dun understand wad the hell the lecturers are teaching. Especially computer hardware. Digital circuit, Data com.

8907,4060812,"12,August,2004",2004-08-12,"   Yap ... The 1st day, we all met at the tanah merah ferry terminal ... ohhh ... how glad i was to see him ... lahtough i like saw him only like less than 8 hours ago ... haha ... i feel like a small girl !!!! Anyway, when we boarded the ferry, we all sat down; me, my sis, him, his sis. And we all actually fell asleep !!! cause we were all too tired ... LOL!!! Anyway, when we got there, we got a very very warm welcome from the people there. Haha ... There were also pretty much sights to see !!! muahahahah!!!! But i will stay loyal to you-know-who!!! Anyway, That day, we did pretty much almost every landspot there was to do ... I WAS SO DAMN TIRED TO DO ANYTHING BY THE TIME IT WAS NIGHTFALL!!! We did squash, tennis, badminton, basketball, volleyball, and many many more which i have practically forgotten. Anyway, we also went swimming for like about a few hours and the sun was scorching like hell!!!! Me and Olaf like had a few waterfights, trying to drown one another out!!! Hahahaha !!! We had such great fun that day, but also lots of muscle-aches. Oh ya, that night after dinner, there was a show(as usual) and it wasnt as interesting as i had remembered it to be, but anyway, we stayed on till the end of the show. After the show, we proceeded to the disco . When we got there, as i was sitting down and he went to get drinks, 2 girls approached him and started to talk to him. Surprisingly, i did not feel anything at all ... He felt pretty embarassed and guilty, i dun know for wad reason. But i decided to excuse myself. I left to go outside and he followed along. I told him that he could go and accompany his new girlfriends and he said that he would rather accompany me ... Wadever. We went for a walk at the beach. The beach was sooo peaceful ... I felt so at ease. We talked as we walked from one end to the other, and back again. It got too late and we decicded to go back to out rooms and sleep. Day 2 was for water sports . We did practically almost every water sport and was so exhausted by noon that we just fell asleep after lunch. We woke up beside one another at about 4pm and went on to play some more sports and swimming. Another waterfight went on, till i surrendered and let him drown me just once. Hahaha !!!! Day 3 was the day we were leaving club med and i actually miss this place. We spent the morning packing our lagguage and left for the ferry terminal. Having reached Singapore, we proceeded for dinner at Changi. When we sent them to Changi Airport for their flight to Colombo, i gave him a hug. Thats about all!!!! I MISS HIM SOOO MUCH ALREADY AND ANTICIPATING FOR HIS RETURN VISIT TO SINGAPORE AGAIN!!!! "

5147,4067087,"31,July,2004",2004-07-31,"   In a state of too many thoughts broiling through my brain.. chatted nonstop to my aunt and a good friend while waiting for the flight.. Reflecting on the kind of person I am.... What direction I want to go... am I nuts?... Chatting nonstop about the week... Missing my Hubby Missing my Kitties.. Flew home with a High School basketball crew... Interesting..  Got home, shoes off, bags dropped.. Wine poured.. (rubiat-Cakebread cellers yum) Couch, cats, laptop... I'm home.. Ahh  "
5148,4067087,"28,July,2004",2004-07-28,"   What a day!       &nbsp;   Our day started off with  importing our videos.. an exercise in mechanical frustration.. Trying to get the video downloaded and distributed took up a chunk of our time.&nbsp; Not only finding the 'right' firewire, but, getting the 'correct' spot on the video camera.. so working with unfamiliar hardware.. arghhhhhhh... We sort of kept going back discussing it during the day to figure out how best to manage splicing together the video, so it's something that is still bothering the team. We're not frustrated with each othibut rather.. but how to best approach the project & overcoming technical difficulties and a sense of losing time.     &nbsp;  The Lego project-   This one definately fit the serious fun, but also 'challanging'.&nbsp; We all talked about how to 'create' a good rover. Charleen had a great idea to go out to the hallway for a quieter space.. So we spread out on the comfy chairs and tried out different ideas & pieces on how to best make a the solar panel cleaner. Everyone had suggestions and we were all picking up pieces and trying out different ideas.&nbsp; Everyone 'saw' where the other was going.. and modified or contributed to 'well.. how can we make this work.. will it work?&nbsp; Some questions definately need to be answered like.. Just what is the range.. etc.. on the sensor.. so not having all the information in terms of what the 'material could do' was sort of frustrating in the 'planning' dept.&nbsp; Tommorrow will be a lot of trial and error and we're expecting that.     &nbsp;  Dreamweaver-   Blogger-    &nbsp;  "
5149,4067087,"18,August,2004",2004-08-18,"   ARP's.. changes... etc.......  Well.. informal chatting with coworkers.-they seem to like my digit photography/Website building ideas..  I do have a pretty good tech savvy staff I work with.  I swear everyone is ending up with the statement, hey, take a survey tho! Baldridge in Education seems to be establishing roots. (lol) With that thought in mind, for one of my 'adjunct' duties, I signed up to be one of the data/survey coordinators.. which is taking parent, student & teachers surveys 2-3 times a year and collaborting the data.. It seemed to be a good match for this year.   COOL thing today was asking my 21 first graders-""Who has a computer"" instead of the 4 to 6 I usually see, about 3/4ths of the students raised their hands.. (YES!) and since I only have 2 out of 4 computers set up so far, two of my youngsters wandered over to the one computer I had turned on and was creating some paperwork for the class... and started clicking away to see what was there...  (good thing I saved) There was no hesitation whatsoever in their movements either.. WAY too comfy..  I knew one of them was tech savvy when I went.. ""ACK, I was working on a paper."" He got that look of 'GULP' his eyes went wide and he told me, ""I'm so sorry teacher.""  yep.. he's worked on a computer before.. I told him I saved, so should be okay.. but.. LET me log you onto the student account..   Hmm.. I definately think my 6 & 7 year old students will be changing the world... afterall.. born.. around 97... The Tech BOOM babies...  One of the parents was asking another teacher about computer use.. (that other teacher has FOUR computers in her room.. you only have one.... and who is the computer for, you or the students?)  Signals of good things...  That kinder/first grade combo class looks like it may be a real possibility, very.. very soon.. spent about an hour talking about logistics and possibibilties today.. look, another gray hair..  "
5150,4067087,"16,August,2004",2004-08-16,"   Now that I have the hobbit's attention...  I think I've spent more time away from home than not this summer.  Flew down to Laguna beach to see the Pagent of the Masters for the first time this weekend.. and I've been working 10 hour days setting up the classroom..  Today, was the first day of school.  A good friend was my sub today. I had a very pleasent shock, walking into a quiet classroom.. (hey, I still showed up at lunch after all, no pay, but ya gotta be there.. )  I do have one autistic/ADD student from Mexico who speaks no English... I have a smattering of Spanish.. After having a full blown panic attack last Thursday, My very kind, patient and listener of a principal set up aide time to help out in the classroom. My major concern is simply if something upsetting happening.. I don't have the language to help the student out! He does like visuals tho, tv, computer, photo's.. (hmm... something in common I see... that could be usful)  When I walked in, they seemed to be doing a pretty good job.   wheee.. I'm inviting my friend every year I think to go over rules & regs I think-she did such a fantastic job.   After the training Wednesday and realizing that I am such a visual learner.. I was thinking of having new fellow up front take the occasional digital picture with the inexpensive camera the teachers got at the Science Institute early in July. (little point and shoot)  Hopefully, if he has a picture with some 'ownership' to it.. hopefully, that will encourage him to write about it.  And so that things are fair, perhaps 'sharing' the camera with classmates.. to spur their writing. (I do have a goodly number of eld students-so if I can push the visual learning/language develop/ownership/fun factor..... may be interesting....  and after all this thought.. I may even end up with a kinder/first grade combo in a week or two....  That curse of 'may your life be interesting...' till holds true today..  and since it's is soo bedtime right now... gnight all and happy blogging..  "
18623,4072259,"30,July,2004",2004-07-30,"   Why does it seem like a good idea when you are at the bar with your friends to keep saying ""yes"" to ""do you want another beer?"" when you know that you have to be&nbsp;at work at 8am and if you stay out late 8 am comes even quicker than it normally does. Didn't they ingrain it into us as children to ""Just Say No""? Nancy Reagen would NOT be proud of me. I did not D.A.R.E. to keep myself off drugs last night.   INSANITY: preforming the same actions over and over and expecting different results.  yup that is my life. And the bar wasn't even worth it because this person that&nbsp;I have been doing a proverbial dance with for the past year decided it would be a good idea to try to come talk to me after standing me up the last time we were supposed to have a big serious talk about our relationship, or lack there of one, not to mention it was said persons idea to have this talk and I was the only one that showed up for it. yeah whatever. I was going to comment on Kerry's speech last night but I feel I need some more time to collect my thoughts, so for now Salute and just say NO!!  "
18624,4072259,"29,July,2004",2004-07-29,"   Sooo I am just now jumping on this whole blogging band wagon. It seems pretty cool and seeing as though I am perpetually bored at work, hopefully this will prove to&nbsp;be a source of&nbsp;entertainment to pass the hours untill I am bored and not at work. &nbsp;I just recently graduated from college and I find myself in a job that has absolutley NOTHING to do with my degree (which I am sure I am the 1st person this has ever happened to) but the thing is that there is not even an opportunity to get into my field.&nbsp; All my plans got messed up. I was supposed to be going to law school in the fall but I didn't get in, it was really sad there were 250 seats for the one school I applied to and there were 1900 people applying for those seats (damn economy), yeah I wasn't one of them, so now I gotta wait another year and try to be a productive, contributing member of society&nbsp;and I failed to realize what I was getting myself into when I signed up for that label.&nbsp; And now here I am working in an office doing accounts payable, which is a far cry from my degree (political science with a public service specialization). But ya know whatever I guess.&nbsp;and so concludes my first blog, I hope it was as good for you as it was for me...right.  "
18625,4072259,"12,August,2004",2004-08-12,"   Do you ever just want to like go somewhere that is not where you are and at really desperate times could be anywhere and re-create yourself? Not so much re-create yourself I guess but re-create your life. New friends, new social circles, whatever. I've done it once but it was a long time ago and as much as it was a disaster (I came back home in 6 months; the grass was way greener on the other side) I think it has been so long that it is starting to sound like a good idea again. I have this problem with staying in one place for too long. I believe that this is my mother's fault. (I don't mean that in the sense of I blame my mother for how my life turned out and I don't mean it negatively, I like the fact that I am so restless, I think it makes me strive for more so that I can move on) Anyways, when I was little we used to move all the time and I don't remember it ever being sad I was always excited at the possibilitiesI guess. I got really good (and still am) at adjusting quickly but I guess it had some negetive effects in that I am extremely restless. And  Icould leave a place with out looking back pretty easy. I mean don't get me wrong there are people that I would still talk to. I think I missed my calling and I should have joined the circus or worked for some traveling festival. I have no musical talent so maybe I could be a roadie. Do they let girls do stuff like that? hmmm.       It's really funny the closer you get to people the more they think they own you, like by them knowing you better than most gives them some claim on you, not so much posession in the psychotic way but more in like a jealous way. And then you do something and some how your action that had nothing to do with them turns into a personal attack on them and it is all completely your fault? yeah I guess this makes no sense from the outside and it is completely spurratic but it is working for me so i'm going with it. Why is that that we think we can claim possession over people? that's a really strange concept. Like is it human nature ? Or are we programmed to ""obtain"" things and so it just floods over to our personal lives along with our material objects. Like it's a little different my husband/my wife whatever but like just your friends even. ""Oh so and so is MY best friend"". ""Oh so and so is MY really good friend"".  What about ""WE are really good friends"". ""WE are best friends"". that's rather interesting to me i suppose.       Human nature, what a bitch.       So stay stuck in this town for another year and then move somewhere else and start the process all over again...I often wonder when I get the bug to just up and go if I will be like this for the rest of my life. that kinda scares me. Maybe I need to be challenged to plant my roots. but that's way too permanent.    I'm commitment phobic and I am proud!  "
18626,4072259,"09,August,2004",2004-08-09,"   You have no Idea how I wish it was Sundy. I really think the weekends wear me out more than the week days. Saturday night I attempted to watch a movie at my friends house and I became painfully aware of the fact that I have ADD. I cannot sit and watch a movie to save my life. I can however look at everything in the room except for the TV,  go to the bathroom 600 times, smoke like 4 cigarettes, play with matches, get everyone a beer when they need it, light candles, and play solitare. I apologized to everyone after the movie for being such a distraction. I can only really watch movies if I am exausted, stoned, or in the confines of a freezing over priced movie theater where it is dark, you are stuck in an uncomfortable seat, and there are other people there who are not your friends and not so forgiving when you do everything but watch the movie.  At least do to my aprox. 6.7 second attention span I can do many projects at once and do them well. I just have to have like 6 things going on all simultaneously so that there is no chance of me getting bored. It's funny at work I will start a project do half of it start another project, do half and keep doing this until I am bored and start back at the beginning project. I started studying for the LSAT again and I think this time around it is harder because I am kinda mad that I have decided to take it again and therefore have an aversion to studying for it. After all the stress of taking it the first time my consolation prize was that I would not have to ever do that again...and here I am getting ready to go through all that stress agian. I can't wait for the bar (NOT looking forward to that test) . I have researched the test and it drives me crazy that this ""aptitude"" test is only like aprox. 50% accurate in determining whether you will be successful in law school, they just continue to use it out of tradition or sadistic torture. My friend asked me the other day why I wanted to be a lawyer and I quickly answered because I am a massochist. anyone who has gone through the long hard process of either professional school or graduate school knows exactly what I am talking about. I just keep reminding myself that it is worth it. And yeah I do know it is. so I will just keep studying it. blah back to work.  "
18627,4072259,"04,August,2004",2004-08-04,"   Me and a friend of mine were having a conversation the other day about drinking and motives and such and I came up with a conclusion about it. I think that ""smart"" people drink to become dumb and ""dumb"" people drink to appear smart. Now not that I consider myself to be exceptionally intelligent but my mind is always going, always thinking, always contemplating and when I drink it shuts it up for a short while. And I have noticed that some people when they drink attempt to exert their ""mental dominance"" upon other people. It's quite interesting to go to the bar and just observe (well you know drink too, but observe in the process). It's quite amazing to me this world we have here. We have enough resources so that every person on this earth could live comfortably, but we are obsessed with accumulating as much wealth and/or resources as humanly possible and then sitting on it so that it benefits no one but ourselves. For as civilized as we are supposed to be (which when looking at technical and medical advances we really are) we are still barbarians. We trample other countries (not specifically the US, any 1st world nation), steal or take or declare their resources as our own, and give them nothing in return. We are like little children at recess and then the littler (read weaker) children either make friends (read become the lackeys of) with the bigger stronger children or they mock the behavior on children smaller than themselves. For as civilized as we are we completely lack compassion. We try to keep two people who love each other from becoming ""married"" because it will ruin the sanctity of marriage, tell me where the sanctity is when people can get married for 18 hours/be married 5+ times/ commit adultry/beat their spouse etc. thats sacred and upkeeps the sanctity of the union? And how many people don't see the absurdity of that argument? ""God"" said marriage is between a man and a woman well ""God"" also said a whole lot of other crap that no one pays attention to. I am striaght and am completely against the idea of marriage because I think it's a joke and means no more of a commitment to me than just being in a relationship with somebody.  A woman can be threatened with laws that will directly affect her body and life because some religious right wingers want to make personal decisions political?? YOU ARE A MAN YOU HAVE NO SAY!! when you get pregnant then we'll talk!! If you are that against abortions then DO NOT HAVE ONE!!! But do not decide that your choice or your values should be imposed on every other human being just becuase you THINK you are right. We come up with wonderful life changing medical advances (e.g. drugs, precedures etc.) that will save lives or improve the quality of some peoples lives etc. and then we allow pharmacutical companies and insurance companies to charge outrageous prices so that only like the top 10% of the population can afford them (now I am exaggerating slightly but you get the jist)? we are making money off of disease and diseases that are occuring at record numbers because we pollute and have no respect for the environment. ""Criminalize the symptons while we spread the disease"" thank you Ani D. UGGGHHHHH!!!!!!!!!  yeah that's been building up for a while. perhaps I should stop talking now and that would be a wise idea. See there's my point about my head always going. and that my friends is why I drink  "
18628,4072259,"02,August,2004",2004-08-02,"   So I think that I am convinced that there is some strange time thing that exists and it makes Saturday and Sunday go by in double time. I swear it was just Friday but here I am monday morning back at work. Oh well. It just almost became worth it though because someone just came and dropped us off bagels and although I am much more an english muffin type girl, Einstein Brothers has the best cranberry bagels.    I had this small epiphany this weekend. I live in very very Northeastern Ohio, and  I had to attend this wedding is very very Southern Ohio.  And I now know why most people think of backwoods, farms and corn when they think of Ohio. Wow there was like nothing and the wedding reception was at this ""Country Club"" yeah it was like a barn, and at the reception there were actually people wearing jeans and cammo and little boys taking their shirts off and running around. it was only like a few hours away from where I live but wow it was totally like another world. Amazing to me. I am so a city girl, like even Cleveland isn't really big enough for me but did I appreciate it soo much more after this weekend. I am also estatic because they are announcing today at 1:00pm where, and when Farm Aid will take place and also who is playing. If you don't know what Farm Aid is, it is a concert that is put on every year and all the proceeds go to independent farmers throughout the country. Willie Nelson, Dave Matthews, Neil Young and John Mellencamp are all like ""board of directors"" or whatever and orchestrate the whol;e thing. Willie nelson started it I think back in like 1989. It is always a great time and is for a great cause. Ok well there is my randon tangent filled blog for Monday.  "

10207,4074186,"13,August,2004",2004-08-13,"   My friend Ronda came in late to work yesterday. She was out jogging when a guy riding in the passenger side of an old pick-up truck threw his cup of McDonald's parfait at her. She freaked out at the first sensation of impact, and dropped to the ground as if she'd been shot. She had no clue what hit her until she saw the fruit stuck to her. The truck driver and the parfait-thrower kept on going, but someone at the intersection who saw what happened wrote down their license plate number. So Ronda called the cops. They caught the guy. He had to write her an ""official letter of apology"" (what makes it ""official""?), is being charged with assault, and has a court date set sometime next month. Ronda's pressing charges.  Ever seen Mrs. Doubtfire? ""It was a drive-by fruiting!""  -----------------------------------------  My sister starts teaching again on August 19. That means I have the afternoons to myself.  I need a new routine. I want to start writing again. I mean,  really  writing again. I haven't finished a story in over 7 years. My last major project was a screenplay I started my senior year in high school called  El Bandido . It was a blatant  Desperado  knock-off (""homage, thank you""). Lots of cussing and gun-fights. The first scene took place in a seedy Mexican dive bar called  El Mundo Cerveza . I got about 25 pages into it before getting side-tracked with something else...  Ever since then, I've tried to start new projects. A burgeoning space opera epic, a couple of hard-boiled Batman stories... At one point I remembered writing about me, and my life, and my friends' lives... This was during school, of course, when I saw them almost every day... But now, 5 years later, it's just me. Well, me, my sister, and my little 2-year-old niece. All of my friends are grown-up, married, moved on. They have careers and kids. They've begun new lives, and I'm still here, stuck dwaddling in the past like some heart-sick nostalgic fool. I can't write about them anymore. Our adventures are over. So now I have to invent them. And heroes make inventing stories so much easier.  Well, dammit, the days of me not finishing anything are  OVER . I'm starting a new schedule. Every Monday thru Friday, starting on the 19th, I'm going to wake up at 9:00 AM, sit down in front of the computer upstairs, and WRITE -- WRITE, WRITE, WRITE -- for 5 hours. Non-stop. No breaks. Just writing. And I'm setting a goal for myself. Say, a 10 page short story. I'm not sure how many words that would be, but I'll figure that out after I write my first short story. And no sitting in front of a blank moniter for 2 hours, thinking of something to say. I'm just going to type. Let my fingers move. I'm sure 99% of what ends up on screen is going to be crap. But that's the beauty of editing. You can turn shit into shinola.  Pardon the language.  Anyway, that's my new daily schedule. If I want to  be  a writer, then I have to   write   something. And finish it.  I'll be keeping a daily record of my progess on the blog. Not that anyone ever reads this thing, but I'm doing it for my own sake. Posterity.  -----------------------------------------  My grandparents live in Cape Coral, Florida. About 2 hours west of Miami, on the Gulf Coast. Right now Charley's closing in on Key West, and by mid-afternoon it'll be on top of South-West Florida. Which means Cape Coral.  The street my grandparents live on is the very first street to flood, in even the smallest rain storms. A hurricane could probably submerge half their house, if not all of it. Cape Coral is nothing but a network of canals and harbors, anyway. All water.  I don't know if the county is going to make the residents evacuate, but my grandfather is refusing. He's getting stubborn in his old age. He's old-school Irish. All of his closest friends are dead, his wife hates their lives, and their health is failing. They're heavy wine drinkers, and chain-smokers. Or rather, they used to be. But I have a suspicion they sneak here and there.   This is my grandfather, Popu, shaking his fist at the Universe.  Dad can't talk him out of it. He's dead-set on staying right where he is, come hell or high water, literally.   I guess we'll know what happens tomorrow, won't we?  -----------------------------------------  I still haven't heard from you. Wow. We talked almost every day for two and a half years, and you can't think of what to say to me? No. No, I think maybe it's because you DON'T have anything to say to me. Please prove me wrong. Because I can't believe I've lost my best friend. "

What a tidal wave of arrogance, what a thunderbolt of hubris, that I should be knocked down this hard. But It put me right where I needed to be, I guess. This is where I belong.  I only wish it didn't end the way it did. I wish I could've looked her in the eyes when I said good-bye.  But I'm a man, I suppose, and a real man wouldn't tread in the past.

24596,4075287,"29,July,2004",2004-07-29,"   I have to back to school on the 5th. I will be in 10th grade this year and am really looking forward to it.&nbsp; It is going to be great to see all my old friends again.&nbsp;I really missed them this summer. Sometimes it seems as thought I am a loner. Some times I will be with a group and feel like I am not one of them. Some times&nbsp;I just stand there and laugh when they tell a joke or act like I am interested. Some times every thing that I say just comes out wrong. I will try to make a joke and just end up looking like and idiot. But some times thing just seem... Normal. My jokes go off good, people laugh, and I seem to fit in. Some times I wish that I could be more like some of my friends. I can remember sitting back stage watching my friends go on stage and&nbsp;listening to them make people laugh and wondering why I can't do that.&nbsp; For some reason it seems as though this year is going ot be diffrent. I hope that this will be the year that I prove myself to all my friends. "
24597,4075287,"29,July,2004",2004-07-29,"   I have finished all the I have to do for the summer and am now waiting for school to start back up. I did several.... Fun things this summer. First of all I worked on Pinocchio. The show went well and was very successful but I hate working with little kids. And of course when every time one of them messed up it was the older people that got blamed. But I it is always hard working with kids but over all it was fun. I am really going to miss some of the people that I meet while working on this play. So of them go to different schools so I don't see them much.   I am really looking forward to starting back to school.... I never thought I would say that... I am looking forward to seeing some of the people I haven't seen in a long time. I am also looking forward to Adv Theater with Mr. Scott. Plus when school starts back we start on the fall play. This year we are doing The Princess Bride. It is being scripted by two of my friends. I am hoping to make this the play where I change over from Tech Crew to acting.&nbsp; I want to get the part of the giant.   I am still playing bass and am getting better. I now have good number of songs I can play. The bad thing is that the guitarist I played with graduated last year. I could play with Ben but.... He has no rhythm.   For the pass 16 years our school has been the 2AA High School Chess Champs, but I think that this is the year the we will stop winning. It is not that the other team are so much better than all of us, it is just that we don't have as many good players as we had last year. As I see it now our top four goes something like: Ben, Me, Will K., and Bradley R. Bradley... The guy that will hit himself on command. I now he only does because we tell him to but.... He is still the one who does it. I never thought He would be in our top 4.   I took&nbsp; a trip down to Walterboro, Sc. Yes I know that&nbsp;no one knows where is that. Well it is a little town near the coast. It is very hot and there is nothing to do. The only cool thing is that the movies Radio and Forest Gump were filmed there. Now many of you are wondering why the great Zack Gootman would go there. Well I will tell you that&nbsp;I was forced. But I was able to see one of my old friends. We know him as Stoner, Stone Man, or man other names using the word Stone. He really name is long forgotten. He is also called guitar Monkey. It was cool to hang out with him and his girlfriend. I hope to go back and see him sometime.   Well that is about all there is to know about Zack right now... I'm so lonely.... "
24598,4075287,"16,August,2004",2004-08-16,"   Sometimes you feel like there is nothing more to say. I mean I let you into my life more than my own brother. I mean a person has to have some privacy in his life. I have some scecrets that no one knows and I want it to stay that way. There are somethings that people will never know about me. And it will stay that way. I live a lie.... I and I am ok with that. I don't know why I don't let people into my life. I just don't. And it will stay that way. I feel as if every one I talk to I don't really know. People say that I am really good with listening, I thinlk that is because I don't like talking about myself. It is not that I am ashamed of my past, I just don't like talking about it. Well people need to know. So I will tell you.  I was born Dec. 8, 1988 in Wheeling, WV. I stayed there till I was 3. Then I moved to Gaffney, SC. I lived there till I was in the third grade. We then moved to Walterboro, SC. I hated that town but when I moved up here in the 8th grade I missed it. In the 9th grade I got into Chess, Quizbowl and Theater. I play bass guitar. Cut and dry.  That seems to be about all that I tell people. I could go into more detail but why waste my time. This blog is about me put if you want to get to know me talk to me. I am online all the time. "
24599,4075287,"13,August,2004",2004-08-13,"   I haven't posted in a while. Well there are some new things in my life. School has started back and I like all but 1 of my classes. I got a part in the play. Not the one I wanted, I will be playing Yeste the swordsmith. Mr. Scott has had another child. Chess club is looking better than I thought it would. And life is good.  Ummm. Well I have to say that I have been really angry of late. Not at any one else but at myself. I claim to be an actor, that I can get up on stage and have people pay to see me perform. But now one of the easiest thing and one of the most common I just can't do it. The simple little line that I would have no problem saying on the stage, I find that in life I just can't. Every time I walk up to this person I get all..... Mixed up. I know what I want to say... I have gone over it a thousand times in my head. When I see her I go up and say hi and talk and say good bye, the whole time my mind is scream at me ""say it! Do it, do it now! It is not that hard. three simple words! I love you!"" My heart begs me to do it... But I can't! I just can't! And that makes me mad. But when I see her smile.... I don't know what I will do but she has to know and I have to tell her.... I want it to be in person. To see her face, to take her in my arms... But I can't. I know I would mess it but.... Over the phone I still could mess it up... I could write her a letter, but how impersonal is that! I have to tell her in person, it is the only way. "
24600,4075287,"04,August,2004",2004-08-04,   School starts back tomorrow. I am really looking forward to it. I only wish that I could still sleep in. I most likely get very much sleep tonight. I have a lot on my mind. I can't wait to see all my friends. Some more than others. I am really looking forward to working in the theater dept. again. I worked on a summer childrens play but it was not the same as working with my friends at HHS. 
24601,4075287,"03,August,2004",2004-08-03,"   We went through several bands  names. Most of them were stupid but we finally found one that we like. So from now on the band is called English Graden. Interesting name, it comes from a line from I am The Walrus by the Beatles. "
24602,4075287,"01,August,2004",2004-08-01,"   I am now in a band. Wow!!! That is kinda interesting.... Well every one says that they are in a band I really am. We started the band last Friday. We have 1 song finished and 2 or 3 on the way. RIght now there are 3 members. Elliot Garrou, Ben Gootman, and Me. Elliot and Ben play gutiar and I play bass. I guess that you could say that I am the lead gutairist... Yes a bass play is playing lead... Im not really sure how it ended up like that. We started playing and it was determind that I was the best. So when it came time for the gutair solo it turned into a bass solo. Playing bass the solo was smoother and much deeper than any other solo. This added an interesting sound to the song. Our band hopes to write 6 or 7 good songs and 3 or 4 cover songs and then try to get some gigs. The place that we hope to start off at are like Buds Pub or the Rock. We hope to get into this years Kaliedascope. Hopefully with several new songs and more bass solos this band might go some were. "
1495,4075308,"30,July,2004",2004-07-30,   Hi guys!!     &nbsp;
1496,4075308,"11,August,2004",2004-08-11,"   see also:    urlLink  http://mostlyfiction.com/contemp/haddon.htm       I donâ€™t do this with every book I read. Itâ€™s what you do in primary school; choose a book and take it home. Bring it back the day after and write a review. This isnâ€™t really a review; More an account.  Iâ€™m writing about this one though, because although fictional, there is a great sense of triumph at the end of the book. Written by Mark Haddon and winner of the Whitbread Book of the Year Award (JUNE 2003), this book tells the story of fifteen year old Christopher Boone, and his struggle to find out the truth about Wellington, and his mother.  Christopher suffers from Asperserâ€™s syndrome. He loved lists, patterns, numbers and the truth. He hated things that are brown or yellow, crowds, changes, and being touched. He believed his mother died of a heart attack, which is what he was told by his father.  He lived a happy, settled life, until he discovered his neighbourâ€™s dog, Wellington, dead. He began a search to find the murderer of the dog, and began to write a book about it. In his book, he includes mathematical facts, and his view of other peopleâ€™s minds, and the way the brain works.  This book stands out for me, because there are so many times when you feel truly sorry for him, and heâ€™s the kind of person youâ€™d want to meetâ€¦ if he were real. His disability causes him to think like an infant; innocent and immature. Yet he is able to cope in most situations, so long as certain rules are applied. His food must not be mixed. People must not touch him. Even his own parents arenâ€™t allowed to hug him.  I think our lives are like that sometimes. We donâ€™t want everything to be complicated, and get annoyed when people are clingy. And yet some of us are bored so easily.  For me, Haddonâ€™s book is a story of a childâ€™s personality, and the way it works in his favour, to achieve the goals he sets for himself.  Thank you Mr. Haddon. Looking forward to the next."
1497,4075308,"02,August,2004",2004-08-02,"   ""On the day that you were born the angels got together, and decided to create a dream come true. â€™   Since I can remember I have associated this song with my happy childhood. As a child I felt closer to my Godmother, my fatherâ€™s sister Aunt Rosemary, than I was my own mother.  We used to sit in the back room, the nicest room of the house, and listen to â€˜ Carpentersâ€™  records. I canâ€™t recall a time when I couldnâ€™t sing those songs. Even now I can picture us sat on the pink fuzzy carpet, warm and cosy, singing happily away. â€˜ Itâ€™s yesterday once more .â€™  The house was huge, and I had my own room, blue, with a small window above the door to let light in. Every night I stayed at the house, my Aunt would remind me that she would never leave the landing off over night. She knew how much darkness did and still does scare me.  I was a weak child, scared of everything! The Hunchback of Notre Dame was incredibly frightening, and one night I woke after having a childish nightmare. I ran, crying, to my Aunts room, and blubbed that I couldnâ€™t sleep; I was having bad dreams of Quasimodo. â€œWell, you better sleep in here then.â€ After getting me settled beside her she told me a joke, one which I never have found funny: â€˜Mrs. Modo, is Quasi coming out to play? â€™ â€˜No, heâ€™s got a bad back!â€™ Still it was the way she handled things; always looking on the bright side, always knowing how to make it better.  The house was, in my opinion, the most beautiful house in the world. The park outside it was â€˜mineâ€™ I was convinced, and I loved the fact that it was three floors. The attic was huge, and I can remember my aunt making curtains on the big machine table up-stairs.  Downstairs had three living rooms, and a kitchen. The second floor had four bedrooms and a bathroom. My older cousin Robert, once locked me in the hall, and being young, I was too small to reach both the door handle and the light switch. I bawled my eyes out, and hated him for years.  Then, sometime in 2002, I went to tea at my Aunt Rosemaryâ€™s. By this time, weâ€™d moved away from Wortley, and were living in Drighlington Bradford. Aunt Rosemaryâ€™s new house was smaller, but it had two bathrooms, four bedrooms, a sitting room, dining room, kitchen and conservatory. My mother and I sat in the room with my aunt, while she told us that Rob had been sent away to Afghanistan, to fight the war on terrorism. He would be gone four months.  I wrote to him. I told him I was sorry for hating him all those years, and how I was scared for him. Since leaving Leeds our family had drifted apart. Today we never sing happy songs.  As you grow up, you realise changes you never saw before. All of a sudden the world is a scary place, and the people you trust and respect stop lying to you, and you learn to face up to what the world is really like. Suddenly I could really relate to poetry I never understood before. Especially ' Out   Walking With My Father' , by Paul Bitrill. It made sense. Nothing stays the same.  When I was about 12, I asked Aunt Rosemary why we never sang those songs by the Carpenters. She simply laughed. ""Karen Carpenter starved herself."" What did she mean by that? She died so that's the end of it? It never stopped us when I was a child. But then I guess I wasn't old enough to know really.  Ever wish you was a kid again? Yeah Karen. I really  do  wish it was yesterday once more..."

Hello,  my name is Lewis and I suffer from the guilt of not forwarding 50 billion  fucking chain letters sent to me by people who actually believe that if you  send them on, a poor 6-year-old girl in Arkansas with a breast on her  forehead will be able to raise enough money to have it removed before her  redneck parents sell her to a traveling freak show. Do you honestly  believe that Bill Gates is going to give you, and everyone to whom you send  ""his"" email, $1000?   How stupid are we?   ""Ooooh, looky here!

Fuck  'em.   If you're going to forward something, at least send me something  mildly amusing. I've seen all the ""send this to 10 of your closest friends,  and this poor, wretched excuse for a human being will somehow receive a  nickel from some omniscient being"" forwards about 90 times.   I don't  fucking care.  Show a little intelligence and think about what you're  actually contributing to by sending out these forwards. Chances are, it's our  own unpopularity.  The point being? If you get some chain letter that's  threatening to leave you shagless or luckless for the rest of your life,  delete it. If it's funny, send it on.

4970,4077627,"14,August,2004",2004-08-14,"   From This Modern World   As you read this, keep in mind that Bush can't win without Florida, and that elderly blacks in Florida are overwhelmingly Democratic:  Bob Herbert, in today's NYT, informs us that armed police officers have been showing up at the homes of elderly black voters in Orlando, many of them active in get-out-the-vote activities, and scaring the crap out of them.  The ""investigation"" (which officials refuse to discuss, or course) is explained by a lawyer representing the 73-year-old president of the Orlando League of Voters, one of the recipients of this fair-and-balanced treatment:   The fear generated by state police officers going into people's homes as part of an ongoing criminal investigation related to voting is threatening to undo much of the good work of the league. He said, ""One woman asked me, 'Am I going to go to jail now because I voted by absentee ballot?' ""  According to Mr. Egan, ""People who have voted by absentee ballot for years are refusing to allow campaign workers to come to their homes. And volunteers who have participated for years in assisting people, particularly the elderly or handicapped, are scared and don't want to risk a criminal investigation.""   Is there anything the Bush machine won't stoop to?   These people aren't just unfit for office; they're unfit for basic citizenship.  "
4971,4077627,"14,August,2004",2004-08-14,"   Want to know why your prescription drugs cost so much? I'll tell you why, Ronald Reagan. -------------------------------------------------------------   Beginning in 1980, Congress enacted a series of laws designed to speed the translation of tax-supported basic research into useful new products &#8211; a process sometimes referred to as ""technology transfer."" The goal was also to improve the position of American-owned high-tech businesses in world markets. The most important of these laws is known as the Bayh-Dole Act, after its chief sponsors, Senator Birch Bayh (D-Ind.) and Senator Robert Dole (R-Kans.). Bayh-Dole enabled universities and small businesses to patent discoveries emanating from research sponsored by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the major distributor of tax dollars for medical research, and then to grant exclusive licenses to drug companies.    Yes, that's right drug companies are getting patents and exclusive licenses on discoveries paid for with our tax dollars. Where is my royalty check?    Until then, taxpayer-financed discoveries were in the public domain, available to any company that wanted to use them. But now universities, where most NIH-sponsored work is carried out, can patent and license their discoveries, and charge royalties. Similar legislation permitted the NIH itself to enter into deals with drug companies that would directly transfer NIH discoveries to industry.   Does this sound a little like ""conflict of interest"" to anyone else?    The most startling fact about 2002 is that the combined profits for the ten drug companies in the Fortune 500 ($35.9 billion) were more than the profits for all the other 490 businesses put together ($33.7 billion).   There is something wrong here, what the fuck were they thinking?  "

4974,4077627,"13,August,2004",2004-08-13,"   WASHINGTON (Reuters) - One-third of President Bush's tax cuts have gone to the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans, shifting more burden to middle-income taxpayers, congressional analysts said on Friday.   The report by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and calculations by congressional Democrats based on the CBO findings fueled the debate over the cuts between Bush and his Democratic challenger in November, Sen. John Kerry.   Using the CBO's figures, Democrats in Congress said the top 1 percent, with incomes averaging $1.2 million per year, will receive an average tax cut of $78,460 this year, and have seen their share of the total tax burden fall roughly 2 percentage points to 20.1 percent.   In contrast, the report showed that households in the middle 20 percent, with incomes averaging $57,000 per year, will receive an average cut of $1,090 while their share of the tax burden would move to 10.5 percent from 10.4 percent.   The CBO report said about two-thirds of the benefits from the cuts went to households in the top 20 percent, with an average income of $203,740.   People with earnings in the lowest 20 percent, which averaged $16,620, saw their effective tax rate fall to 5.2 percent from 6.7 percent, the CBO said. But Democrats said that meant their average tax cut was only $250.   Democrats said the CBO calculations, which they requested, confirm the view of independent tax analysts that the tax cuts enacted in 2001 and 2003 have heavily favored the wealthiest taxpayers.   What will he do for us next?  "

13343,4078761,"10,August,2004",2004-08-10,"   It's amazing how the days after a perfect vacation can be so miserable.  No reason really.  well, lots of things to think and stress about.  but wow, that was a great trip.  We got to Buxton Thursday night, after driving through a lot of standing water on Hwy 12.  Hurricane Alex had definitely left its mark.  We got to say hello to the beach while we waited for others to arrive.  We found out later that it would only be 11 of us, but in the end that seemed perfect.  It was a great bunch - Alexa and Pete, Chris and Tana, Mark T, Mark E, Philip, Nisrine, Sarah, Susan, and myself.    Friday, we started the day with a devotion and life story.  I went first and they got an ear full.  It was supposed to be 10 minutes and I think it was at least 45.  Lots of tears.  show and tell of the nieces and nephews.  I had just been diagnosed with fibromyalgia on Thursday afternoon, so that was my chance to let everyone know.  Then they all prayed for me.  Very powerful prayer time.  I was really thankful for that.  Then, we headed to the beach.  And what an experience that was.  First, Philip creamed me on a boogie board.  Major wipe-out.  thanks a lot.  He pinned me down, and I yelled at him, ""Get off of me!!""  I was so mad, I turned around and dove back into the next wave.  That was the next major mistake.  Within a few seconds, I was hundreds of feet down the beach, unable to stand up.  The current was so strong after the hurricane, I couldn't believe it.  Between the pounding waves and that current, I really started to get scared.  I kept trying to get back to the shore but I couldn't make it.  Finally, I started crawling out. Nisrine got there just as I managed to get out on all fours.  She helped me to the shore where I gasped for breath for a while (and didn't even feel a crab crawling on me).  Then she and Alexa helped me back to where everyone else was.  I literally had about 3 cups worth of sand in my bathing suit.  Everyone was pretty worried about me.  not half as worried as I was about myself.   We gave up and went back to the motel for lunch.  Then the Marks went to check out another beach - that's the nice thing about Hatteras - you get to chose which side of the island has the best surf.  So it turned out that the south-facing beach was absolutely peaceful.  We headed over there and I finally got to float like I love.  Then we packed up the cars and headed for 10cent shrimp, only to find out that it was too late.  So we headed back and had our cookout instead.  Then we went for frozen custard at Uncle Eddy's, and Isaac offered us a free round of golf.  I got one real whole in one and two honorary ones.  My best round of putt-putt ever - a 42.  Not to bad considering my usual showing.    I started to get really tired that night.  My feet were really hurting.  Hard to stand after a while.  Had a major confrontation with Philip after that, but it was good in the end.  I was very glad to get all that off of my chest.  It's amazing how creepy it is when he tries to touch me.  I don't even want to shake his hand.  Saturday was the perfect day.  Perfect.  Started with Mark waltzing into our room while I was still in my pjs.  He started cooking breakfast, and I just stayed on the couch until I could make a beeline for the bathroom.  He messed up the pancakes and smoked up the room while trying to cook bacon, but it was pretty cute.  Darn it, really cute.    Then we moved to our new room, and two more folks shared life stories.  Mark shared his, and I just wanted to hold him afterward.  It was so sad.  I had a vision about God turning the charred remnants of his heart into diamond incrusted gold.   I hope it's true.    Then the news came back that the surf was perfect, including for me wanting to float.  So we went out, and sure enough, I got to float for at least 3 hours.  Very very happy.    I had a hard time accepting that it was time to come in.  that was when God gave me the refrain: it is enough.  It is more than enough.  Thanks be to God.  I feel like I have to write a Psalm about that, but I'm not sure what it needs to say yet.  then we went for 10 cent shrimp again, and that was wonderful.  sat next to Mark.  happy.    then, the most amazing - kayaking in the sound at sunset.  wow.  incredible.  so peaceful, so beautiful.  I wish I could do that every day.  okay, so I'd settle for once a month.  silence.  easy to be with people.    Mark talked to Sarah a lot, but they talked about ethics and I don't have to know everything about ethics.  she does, because she's getting a PhD in it.  she's jealous of me for my overseas work.  I don't have to be jealous of her.  will she and mark get together?  After kayaking, we headed to dinner.  the Outrigger?  FABULOUS soft shell crabs.  note to self: if that's available, get it every time!  sat next to Mark again.  felt like we connected on a few things.  including the fact that we ordered exactly the same meal.  he has dreamy eyes.  did I mention that?  sad hazel eyes, but the laugh lines aren't tanned, so they stand out more now.  sad eyes with big bright laugh lines.  laughter through tears, my favorite emotion.  then the bonfire.  singing great songs.  I got to sing.  then I went and watched the moon over the water while the others sang.  feeling solitary but not lonely.  beautiful to watch the flicker of the bonfire on the sea foam as the waves came in.  nothing like it.  saw a few shooting stars.   mark and I walked up to the motel together.  I was hoping to talk to him, but his car was there and he had to drive it back.  have a good night.  so I went to my room and stared at the stars a while.  then I went in and saw his travel mug there.  had to bring it back to him, right?  but when i went into his hotel room, he was changing.  oops.  thought you might need this.  oh, yeah, thanks.  good night.  but left feeling happy.  I tried.  I was strong.   decided if I woke up by 7:30 I'd go to church. I woke up at 7:25.  went to church at Little Grove.  I think I surprised him.  sweet folks there.  told him I came because it reminded me of Concord Primitive Baptist.  that's partially the reason.  partially because I really just wanted to be near him.    back to the motel, packed up, grabbed breakfast, realized that Alexa has had a hard life and is not perfect, went to Hatteras for church #2.  good to be there.  God gave me the verse Hebrews 11:11 - she considered him faithful who had promised.   I can do that.  I know God is faithful.  I know that without a shadow of a doubt.  why do I feel like I have so little faith otherwise?  mark and sarah?  a little weird as we left.  sarah rode back with me.  lunch, Mark E and his haircut.  Philip's life story.  I hope people understood a little more about him then.  everyone else left.  finished up Mark E's haircut while MT and I talked.  thought about telling him.  but didn't quite fit.  then Nisrine joined us.  he asked about the diagnosis.  was very kind about it.  encouraged me to get into a support group.  probably will.  need a ride to the airport?  he looked at me like I was insane.  well...  bye sweetie, thanks for everything.  at least I did get a hug out of it.    drive home with Mark E and Nisrine.  I'm glad he was taking care of her.  I slept some.  hard to be home.   I would have rather been at the beach.  for another year or two.  "

11422,4082385,"31,July,2004",2004-07-31,"   a little while ago while looking back at the past, a bunch of old roommates had a bit of a reunion.  oh, and i finally got my motorola v400 to connect to my computer so here are some pix.  of course they had to come out with the v600 a couple of months after i got mine, and that has bluetooth.  *sigh*  how about not releasing new phones that quickly, ehh???  urlLink    bill-boy, woodhall suite-mate, dartmouth apartment-mate, campus village roommate. all that time, and still don't know cantonese :D  urlLink    hubie-boy, woodhall suite-mate, dartmouth apartment-mate, and all around shady guy. but he's cool because i think we were switched at birth, my exact opposite. where are the white girls?  urlLink    david the lovegod, whispering wood suite-mate, woodhall roommate, dartmouth roommate. what can i say, gone thru so much together. the aliens, my sister, tigger, polar-girl, the flight-attendant, oreo... *sigh* the best of times and worst of times. well at least i learned mandarin :D  urlLink    zerokitty... exposed! gimme back my camera!

11423,4082385,"29,July,2004",2004-07-29,"   What's the deal lately.  Seems like everyone I know is either getting married or moving away.  Don't they realize how inconvenient this is for me?  Or maybe it is just life telling me its time to get marr... uhm, move away too.  Sell off my house and my car and all earthly possesions... then move to some remote mountainside, live off the land, and teach the local wildlife Java (they already know VB).  Or maybe not.  But it is interesting to step back and reflect on life once in a while.  Look down on the world from above, see how the chess pieces (including oneself) move around, oftentimes in ways one would never have thought or hoped they would.  Change isn't as hard or scary from this perspective, and somehow things always tend to work out how they should in the long run.  Better not stand around and reflect for too long though, or else a bird will fly by and take a crap on my head.  So as they say, All Things Must Pass... which is true and a good reminder to accept it and just try to make each new phase of life better than the last.   "

Last night I saw  The Cardigans  at the House of Blues in Downtown Disney.  It was the first time seeing my favourite band from Sweden (only band from Sweden?) and highly recommend their  new album  that finally got released in the US.  Amazing to see Nina sing live not more than five feet away, *swoon*.  And then the stars must have been aligned right today, as during a staff volleyball game I somehow got myself involved in, I actually had a killer game.  Being the awkward tall guy, things didn't start well after joining, but after weeks of practice things are coming together.  Good thing, because one of the stars of the team, another tall spiker guy was out sick.  Luckily I had some good plays, and one to end the game with a rather strong spike that almost took the head off some very cute girl on the opposing team ;P.  The whole team was good today and we easily won our 3rd straight game.  Although our competition will get stronger later on in the playoffs, it is good practice to defeat these teams in straight sets.  And a good way to let off some steam of a tough week :D   "
11426,4082385,"11,August,2004",2004-08-11,"   So not too long ago I was helping out my  urlLink good friend  at work investigate this chat/photosharing application called  urlLink Hello .  It is a chat program, but a really basic one with not too many features.  However the cool thing about it is that you can trade pictures with other users very easily, and adds comments and point things out at what the other user is looking at.  This is not what interested us though.  It seemed there were hidden features to be found, such as if you typed certain words they would be auto-expanded in the chat or create animations in the photo window.  She did an excellent job of explaining  urlLink on her blog =) , so I won't repeat.  We eventually went a little further though.  While investigating the code in a hex editor (geeks past this point only, thanks) I found the references to the animation pictures (and the keywords to create them).  Looks like they are stored in a file in the ""Hello\runtime"" directory called ""motio.psd"".  Hmmm, sounds like a Photoshop file to me.  Alas, it was!  And the reference names were to the names of the different layers on the photoshop image where each animation is stored.  So as you can see on the image below, we messed around with this a bit and traded modified files.  You can easily change the picture on each layer to however you want, save the file (using the latest photoshop version) and restart Hello to see new animations.  Obviously it only works for the computer you are on, if you want your friends to see them too, you have to send them your modified file and have them copy it to the proper location.  Unfortuantly to add new keywords would be difficult, have to wait for a new version with pluggable keywords (yeah right).  We were able to modify the .exe file a bit through the hex editor though, and change keywords or the expanded versions a bit (if they were the exact same length) with... some good and some bad results :D   urlLink   "

21528,4086028,"09,August,2004",2004-08-09,"   Stealing a thought from one of my closest friends  ""It's one thing to go away for a couple of months but a whole year is some serious time, especially considering life-changing decisions and events can happen in a fraction of a second."" It's wierd how a 'small' statement can bring together things that have shied away from the frontal lobe.  Revalation seems a bit heavy - more an encroaching sense of recognition. Even more daunting are the times  a journey comes to an end. Often your first fledgling steps can appear cumbersome on hindsight, but given the opportunity would you change them? Having reached the end of the path to China my mind is unwilling to take in that there is no longer the adventure of reaching the adventure. This  is  the adventure. It's odd when you saunter back and observe just how institutionalised you can become into the life that you know. When you see that every little habit that you have has evolved from some small niche unbeknownst to you, how can you even tell what will happen when the safety net dissolves.  "

I was having cramps on my toes n hou shun tried to help, but he yue bang yue mang.... He bent my toes wif e cramp instead of upwards against it n i almost cried... Luckily another guy came along to help instead... Otherwise, i think i'll be lame by now...  Our 1st part of e activity was kind of relaxing, but.... we had to lie down on e floor n put our cheeks on e floor while warming up... I think yinghan really very wu yuan wif e guo qing liang bcuz, everytime he came, she didn't go n vice versa...  Now, i'm gonna tok abt 'her' again.....  Guess wad? She yelled at me in e com lab in front of ~20 ppl!! She didn't do anything for e written report except e biblio, survey analysis n in text citation for me n pris part(very min, n was juz copy n paste into e body) Jiam was doing both intro n conclusion, so i sent her me n pris' part last nite, but she couldn't receive it... Tt's wad e meeting during pw was for, to finish e WR... As pris n i had finished wif our parts n our editing, we did our own stuff.... Pris was doing her mail thingy n i was attaching my hist notes... 'She' was busy w/o a purpose as usual... Ya, n jiam realised she couldn't finish both, so she asked us if we could help, n so we did... However, we didn't noe how to do e rationale for task 1, so we sought help frm tt ""forever busy wif something"" fui foon... She came over wif a not so nice face (btw, her face looks horrendously ugly, which my frens n i found unexplainable) n started bending down to type... We tot it was rather xing ku for her height, so we asked her to type at her com instead... Then, she showed us her bu shuang face, n got us to do e rationale for choosing e topic.... Pris n i were discussing, when she interrupted, asking me to translate wad i had recorded (jiam's ideas were in chi n i didn't noe how to translate, so they asked me to pen it down accordingly)... I tried to help her as much as possible n was toking to myself to c if e sentences i translated linked... I later repeated n asked for her opinion, but she didn't gif an answer.... So, i looked at her screen to c wad she was doing... I realised she misspelt 'chosen' for 'choosen' n so i pointed out to her in a very polite way.... This is wad i said,""I think u spelled an extra 'o' for chosen..."" Then she slammed e keyboard drawer, pushed e chair backward real hard n yelled at me so loud everyone in e com lab stared at me,"" U so clever u come n do lah!!"" Well, as everyone noes, i'm not someone to be trifled wif, esp when i'm yelled at for doing nth wrong, so of cuz i shouted back at her,"" Ni xian zai gen wo fa shen me huo? Ni yi wei zhi you ni you huo arh! Ni shen me dou mei you zuo dao lor!"" ""Shen me jiao wo shen me dou mei you zuo dao?!"" she RETORTED, packed her things n stomped off...  I was so angry n felt so wei qu for i was being fired at for no reason esp when i hao bu rong yi rushed out my part of e wr n edited pris' part as well... i mean, i completed my fen nei things liao lor.... So, i walked out too... Then i saw jiyu waiting for history lesson n i couldn't bear it any longer, so i toked to her... (very agitated of cuz) irin n xueying sensed something wrong so they came over too.... I was so angry n wei qu, i broke down... Then, mr tan came... I think he was quite shocked to c me so agitated n crying cuz i'm always bubbly n cheerful in his class... He suggested i go for a drink to cool down 1st then join in e lesson wif jiyu....  I felt better after toking it out, so i went up to e com lab to collect my things... There, i saw jiam, pris, man n ying jing coming out n they told me tt fui foon was in there oso... I hesitated, then decided to go in... I saw her wif peiyu n she actually apologised, saying she bu shi gu yi fa wo pi qi but juz bao cuz she ren bu zhu..... I glanced at her n realised she had tearry n bloodshot eyes, meaning she was crying n complaining to others lor... Hugh! Juz as i expected! Make me look like huai ren again... Machiam i bully her... Not surprising if she had gone to complain to ms tan either... Anyway, her impression of me couldn't go any worse.... Anyway, since she had apologised, i apologised oso lor you bu hui tong...  In e end, jiam n pris completed e wr though it took longer than e pw lecture period n i suppose mr ng wouldn't mind as long as we handed it in....   "

31249,4100455,"11,August,2004",2004-08-11,"   wrote this awhile ago but it's (infortunately) still relevant:   At the 2002 Academy Awards when Michael Moore won in the documentary category for Bowling for Columbine, his speech was quickly drowned out by the audiencesâ€™ jeers and the peppy music escalating from the orchestra pit. The reason for this uproar? That Moore used the word â€œfictitiousâ€ to describe the unfolding war in Iraq. In a similar episode a couple months later, Chris Hedges had to be escorted of the campus of Rockford College in Illinois by security guards after giving a provocative commencement speech about the ongoing war. [1]  These incidents illustrate the public fury that meets those who question war and patriotic rhetoric during armed conflict. In his book,  War Is a Force That Gives Us Meaning , Chris Hedges explores the horrific phenomenon of war from the unique perspective of a former seminarian who became a war correspondent. The combination of Hedgesâ€™ years of firsthand experience in war zones and his capacity to grapple with the philosophical and cultural implications of war makes for a bold and cathartic bookâ€”one that challenges the reader to understand that whatever truth can be excavated from the mythological grandeur of war is truth that is painful, ugly, and far removed from conventional propaganda. Hedges stresses in the introduction that he is not immune to the intoxicating power of war. Rather, he writes from a position of repentance and even self-antipathy, likening his relationship with war to that of an addict to her preferred drug. He writes, â€œâ€¦ There is a part of me that remains nostalgic for warâ€™s simplicity and high, even as I cope with the scars it has left behind, mourn the deaths of those I worked with, and struggle with the bestiality I would have been better off not witnessing.â€ [2]  Hedgesâ€™ pain is evident throughout the book, and occasionally elevates the prose to the level of diatribe. Yet Hedgesâ€™ honesty about his susceptibility to warâ€™s grasp is fundamental to the bookâ€™s success. By refusing to blame systems without blaming self, Hedges establishes a humble credibility. The reader is more likely to trust this flawed writerâ€”trust both his firsthand accounts and the meaning he makes of them. Hedgesâ€™ credibility is essential, as the majority of the bookâ€™s references are literary. Hedges primary motivation is to expose the disconnection between the reality and mythology of war. Culling from the war literature of such writers as Homer and Shakespeare, Hedges argues that war mythology â€œâ€¦ can be formed only by denying the reality of war, by turning the lies, the manipulation, the inhumanness of war into the heroic ideal.â€ [3]  As a war correspondent, Hedges has a great deal of primary experience of war. Yet he exposes the mediaâ€™s complicity in perpetuating war mythology, arguing that â€œThe blunders and senseless slaughter by our generals, the execution of prisoners and innocents, and the horror of wounds are rarely disclosed, at least during a mythic war, to the public.â€ [4]  Hedges thus effectively demonstrates how perfectly sealed and protected the truth behind war can be. This element of Hedgesâ€™ argument is further substantiated in the chapter titled â€œThe Destruction of Culture.â€ Culture is easily corrupted to accommodate both the war myth and the need to forget the war reality, as demonstrated by Hedgesâ€™ assessment of post-war Germany, where it was â€œas if the war was just some bad, horrible dream from which everyone had just awoken and no one wanted to discuss.â€ [5]  The distortion of reality is welcome to those affected by war, for as long as one is protected from truth, one is protected from further pain. The climax of  War Is a Force That Gives Us Meaning  is Hedgesâ€™ philosophical appraisal of the reasons behind our collective thirst for war. Borrowing from Freudâ€™s psychological explanation of human nature, Hedges underscores the opposing forces that drive humanity: the calling to create and the drive to destroy, the inclination to love and the proclivity to kill. [6]  In effect, Hedges offers to the reader the double-edged sword of realism, in which love is redemptive but war is inevitable. That Hedges quotes Reinhold Neibuhr in more than one instance in the book is telling. Hedges does not equate warâ€™s inevitability with its morality; the culpability Hedges advocates is the culpability of varying shades of immorality. The difficulty with a book like Chris Hedgesâ€™ is its capacity to alienate those who most need to hear its message. Hedges is careful to differentiate soldiers fighting in mythic wars from the political authorities who sponsor mythic wars. Yet the public generally does not make this distinction, so the dismantling of patriotic propaganda could easily be likened to a lack of support for armed forces. The book could also easily be usurped by those on the progressive left. Hedges is quite apolitical in his critique; perhaps the greatest strength of the book is Hedgesâ€™ conviction that everyoneâ€”left or right, Serb or Croat, American or Afghaniâ€” participates in war mythology. â€œWhen you stop believing you stop going to war,â€ [7]  Hedges states confidently. The first step in the process of ceasing to believe in the myth is to understand the myth.  War Is a Force That Gives Us Meaning  is a book that makes evident that one manâ€™s truth is more compelling than fifteen yearsâ€™ worth of warâ€™s myth.

31251,4100455,"10,August,2004",2004-08-10,"   i suppose it's sort of strange to review one song of an album. but the song, performed live, deserves considerable mention. the song is great on  ohio  (2003); painful on  changes come  (2004).  the lyrics:   Changes come     Turn my world around I have my father's hand     I have my mother's tongue     I look for redemption in everyone I wanna wear your ring     I have a song to sing     It ain't over babe     In fact it's just begun Changes come     Turn my world around     Changes come     Bring the whole thing down I wanna have our baby     S    omedays I think that maybe     This ol' world's too fucked up     For any firstborn son There is all this untouched beauty     The light the dark both running through me     Is there still redemption for anyone Jesus come     Turn the world around     Lay my burden down     Turn this world around     Bring the whole thing down     Bring it down       the subtle shift from ""changes come"" to ""jesus come"" is chilling. it's almost as if the singer isn't completely sure she wants jesus to come; that even though she wants change, the enormity of the eschaton is a little too big. this song is begging for a frightening thing: the end of the world as we know it. given the context in which this song was written- in the wake of 9/11 and the cusp of a senseless war- the lyrics aren't all that extreme.  it strikes me as the polar opposite of mark twain's war prayer, a satire of the twisted religiousity of patriotism.  there's no assumption of righteousness, no false claim of god-on-our-side.  just pure lamentation.

31252,4100455,"08,August,2004",2004-08-08,"   somewhat disappointing.  usually films that win for best screenplay (as  t.b.i . did at cannes in 2003) are genuinely great films; this one is not.  the characters seem a little too-roughly chiseled from overused cliches: the Prodigal Son, the Heroin Waif, the Emotionally Closed-Off Father.  instead of having believable traits and idiosyncracies, the characters are held in thrall to what their respective types would say or do.   nevertheless, there is some good stuff.  the father and son are predictably set up as opposites, but their differences are compelling, rooted in tensions of ideological import (socialism vs. capitalism, etc.).  it's fascinating to watch how these tensions manifest themselves in an ordinary yet painful situation, the experience of dying.  the father has his radical compatriots and the son has his money, and neither can purchase more time.  worth watching, despite its frustrating limitations.

31255,4100455,"06,August,2004",2004-08-06,"   i've been meaning to buy a r. sexsmith album for a long time now, ever since i heard his version of ""ships go out"" on the tom t. hall tribute.  i bought  blue boy  used at the hollywood amoeba last weekend, and i've been listening to it at least twice a day since.  the songs are spoonfuls of nearly-perfect pop; the lyrics are sweet, frank, and clever-but-not-too-clever.  on the first track r.s. sounds a bit like rufus wainwright, but without the qualities that bug me about r.w.  the saddest and most beautiful song on the disc is ""foolproof,"" which employs trumpets reminiscent of sarah harmer's sophisticated instrumentations.  r.s.'s vocals are stylish in an almost old-fashioned way, full of unexpected riffs and unscripted emotions.   the last time i fell for an album so quickly was over four years ago at the kent state university bookstore, when i happened upon a little album called  good dog bad dog  and immediately knew that i'd found my favorite band.   i've heard r.s.'s  retriever  is an excellent album as well, though i'm tempted to go back to his earlier work so as to not read the book backwards.

I started a new exercise regime today. Yes, on a Tuesday. Sundays seem to jinx me. Now, I'm not in it to lose weight (at 5' 5'' and 110 lbs. I can't afford to). It was quite invigorating, actually. I'm hoping I stick to it. I really can't afford to get flabby. And we all know, summertime is the easiest time to do that.  I'm done with being shy. Seriously, it's gotten me now where thus far. It is a pointless emotion, only holding me back from my true potential. I mean, I'm just as pretty, talented, intelligent, witty and all-round great as the next gal (not to sound vain), but I still get all fuddled and muddled around certain people. Gosh... why didn't I decide to do this sooner? Hmm.. the possiblities are now endless. Yay!  Well, children.. ta-ta for now. Be good. Remember...  I'll be back. Mwahahahahahah- choke*cough*.  Ahem. Right. Bye.  "

Thank you for your understanding, and even if you donÂ´t, tough.**  A strange man is playing guitar and crooning mellow songs on my TV.  Shudder . I really hate folk music. Nostalgia is good, but add an acoustic guitar, and a handful of soulful back-up singers swaying and swooshing... aargh. No way.  I've been thinking about becoming more cultural. I look at my life, and I say ""Kamara, you really lead a sheltered life."" No Russian novels on my bookcase, no operatic CDs in my collection...  (oh no, he is singing gypsy music!) , no witty intellectual friends on speed-dial whom I can call at 2 o'clock in the afternoon and discuss the fickleness of humanity, whilst munchin' on some chocalat. None of that. So I say to myself, ""Kamara, you need to get some culture.""  ""I know that,"" I reply, ""but what is there to do on a small, tropical island which prides itself on how many half-naked tourists sunbathe on its beaches in a year?""  ""Aha!"" I cry, for I realise, that there in that simple question, folks, lies the answer to my profound lack of culture. Small, tropical islands are, unfortunately, not known as cultural hotspots. No symphonies, no theatre, no (decent) museum, and a library that apparently abhors the classics (or at least makes them terribly hard to find). What's a gal to do?  First thing. High tail it out to some place where there are more people. Statistics show  (and we know I love me some math)  that the more people you have, the more different they will be. And since people dictate culture, we can logically deduce that culture will be diverse. Folks, I cannot wait for college! The opportunity to live a new life, it's almost like having a blank slate. I can almost taste it. Sure, living alone will be scary, but for the chance to get some culture and to ""expand my horizons""  (how clichÃ©) , I'll hop the next plane...  Meh. Just had a thought. Suppose there's no culture over there either? Suppose people in big cities are even more narrow minded than those on this sunny isle. Lord forbid...  My quest for culture cannot fail. It musn't.  To culture! And beyond...  "

It's kinda like that first toe-stick into the pool. You know? If the water is too cold, there is no way a herd of drunken buffalos could run you into that pool. The temperature is all-important. Just like this first entry. It's a toe-stick thermometor/glass ball, 76.8% guaranteed to predict the life-expectancy of any fledgling blog, within a 20% margin of error. So judging from this, the toe-stick thermometer says ( wiggling toe-stick thermometer for accurate measurement )... ERROR!  This can't be good...  "

21779,4103386,"07,August,2004",2004-08-07,"   Yay no more Malaysia trip!!! Can celebrate national day in church! Long live Singapore! Today was s0 fun, i went for kayaking in the morning, church in the afternoon and L-cell in the night. In kayaking, we paddled under Merdeka Bridge to a deserted beach. Then, we beached our kayaks and took a swim out to sea(with our life jackets of course). The filthy water was so salty that everyone was choking and gagging on it... 0_o As usual, i found that i had fibreglass splinters from carrying the kayaks. The rough sand on the beach had worn off shards of fibreglass and they got embedded in my arms and hands as i carried the kayak back to base. They were stinging me badly...my arms were covered with red spots... At church, bryan gave me some scotch tape which i used to stick the fibreglass out from my arms(wow that hurt)...the wounds closed up amazingly fast ^^ After church we had L-cell. We walked to the botanic gardens to have dinner at food haven by the park. Guess who we met there? My mum!!! Argh ~.~ And we were sitting close together too...Mel tortured me...  After dinner and cell discussion, we proceeded to the park for a game. Since it was Charlotte's and Rachel's birthday, we decided to play a trick on them. We pretended to play a game of sardines, where one person had to go hide and others and to go find him. But in this case, we all had a pre-arranged meeting point. Soon, the two girls were wandering around alone in the dark park, looking very lost. Meeting up, Bro. Adrian decided to send Yeow and I to lure the girls to the 'ambush' point. Things went so liquid smoothly! The girls were feeling skittish after wandering around the deserted park and wanted to follow me and Yeow around looking for Bro. Adrian...we led them to the pavillion and the others jumped out and yelled,  ""HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!!"" and strted singing the birthday song....it was so cool and funny :) L-cell is so fun :D "

21010,4105180,"07,August,2004",2004-08-07,"   Life is confusing. Full stop. Really.      Sometimes there is a longing for someone to love, someone special, whom you love wholeheartedly, and who returns your love just as passionately. Though I have the love of family and friends, sometimes, even when I spend time with them, I feel that something, someone is missing. Sometimes it's so strong, it becomes a pain within, and I feel as though the whole world is slowly pressing me down, squashing me flat. It's an agony.      ""Some say Love, it is a river   That drowns the tender reed.   Some say Love, it is a razor   That leaves your soul to bleed.   Some say Love, it is a hunger   An endless aching need.   I say Love, it is a flower   And you its only seed.""      Sorry, I don't agree with that, or at least, it doesn't seem like that for me, yet. To me, Love is still yet a hunger, the endless aching need. I've watched him for three years, but he's so much older. Yet, his awkward, gentle nature allures me so, with his love for God, his humbleness, his humour, it is all so endearing. But he is a Uni student, soon to graduate, and who am I? Merely a fifteen going on sixteen with foolish dreams.      I hate rambling, but tonight, I just felt so empty, without any reason. I used to like another guy, more to my age, but I've realised that though he eclipsed him for a span of time, there is nothing really nice about him, merely charm. What shall I do? Wait and see. The pain is back again, and I wish that I had not begun to feel like this so fast. Life seemed so much happier in the past. I sometimes wish it could return to that. But I know it can't, I've changed, and it is irreversible.      God help me, I need Love so.  "

11561,4108638,"11,August,2004",2004-08-11,"   The fall semester has started for me, I begin the internship process and the final semester towards my masters. Granted I have to complete financial aide one more time. Let me tell you how stressful asking for more money again and again and again and again.       I am just tired of fighting with the university to get anything done or to just graduate. Why does it have to be so dam hard to get the financial aide necessary to graduate and do something with my life. I thought the schools purpose was to help people achieve a higher level of education. Yet I face more stress just to get the money to come to school then I have ever faced before. Hopefully if I do everything right I will get some aide by November. Ok that is today's gripe.       On the happy note. I start earning my hours towards internship I have to earn a total of 600 hours, 250 of them in direct client contact. Mathematically that comes out to close to 40 hours of work each week, and 20 of those hours in contact with clients. I think that it will be a great experience and I know I will learn a lot. So wish me luck. :p  "

11563,4108638,"02,August,2004",2004-08-02,"   Long Post time...    Ok so this weekend I traveled to     Dallas     to check out a school for my Doctorate in Psychology.    This school was not what most people would consider as a real school.    This university advertised itself as a school for working professionals to continue to work on their education.    Therefore, I get there and start talking to the admissions person about the program and what it entails.    I find out that just like every other psychology doctorate program it requires a 2-year practicum and a 1-year internship.    Ok so that isnâ€™t too bad, until I find out that I would have to give up whatever job I was working in so to work full time in the practicum/internship unpaid for, three years.      THREE YEARS...No money, no moolah, no cash flow, no income......gee...no food?  How is anyone supposed to work for three years with out being paid?    Now do not get me wrong but no one is going to go into the mental health field and make tons of money.    However, I already have student loans, why would I want to get more student loans.    When will I ever pay them back?    I do not get why practicum/internship students are not paid we are providing a service just as valuable as a mental health practitioner that is out in the field.  I understand that we are still learning, but how are people going to become psychologists if they can support themselves.      Ok so that is my bitch about not being happy about the Dr. situation.    Now for the reason why I am complaining so much.    Since the eighth grade, I have been working towards being a psychologist.    I have heard and been reinforced from my folks, friends, and acquaintances to be a psychologist.    Now I am currently graduating in December with my Masters in Counseling, in     Texas     that will allow me to do the exact same work as a psychologist.    Therefore, what the issue is is that I feel like I am not living up to what I have dreamed about for a long time.    Kind of like a weird sorta of failure to myself.    I think overall I have made the decision to not pursue my doctorate for a while, because I am tired of being broke and living hand to mouth all the time.  I am ready to be an adult and enjoy being independent financially.    All right, time to be done posting.    :)  "
11564,4108638,"01,August,2004",2004-08-01,"   I have three clients that I am going to see tonight at my school's clinic. Normally I wouldn't be to worried, but tonight I am being observed by a different professor then I have been observed by. This prof that is about to observe me, doesn't seem to have a very high opinion about me from previous classes.       Now I feel and have been told that my skills with clients are right on the money for my experience level. I am worried about how she will evaluate my skills. I have a very difficult series of clients to work with tonight.       Well on another note... A good friend of mine has been accepted at UNT to begin working on her masters in counseling. I am really happy for her. More blogging tonight :)  "
11565,4108638,"01,August,2004",2004-08-01,"   This is my first post. :)  It has been an incredibly long week. I have worked several 14 hour days at my internship site. I am a mental health counseling intern. Basically that means I work for next to nothing. I think elephants at the circus make more then I do. I know I sound complainingish... but I really do love my work. Currently I am working with children and adolescents. Sometimes it really just means I play games with kids all day, but you would be suprised how much that can make them feel better about themselves or thier situation.   Soon I will be leaving E. Texas and moving to the big city of Dallas, which scares the crap out of me. I will be a real life serious adult. I want to leave E. Tx but I really dont want to leave the friends behind.

Today was pretty uneventful, hung out with my sister for awhile, and that's about it :p Other than going to Baskin Robbins to say hi to Rhiannon, I didn't get to get any ice cream :( Oh well we have ice cream bars at home if I really want some :p Hmm..... Yesterday was a really good day :) Gene came over around 12:30 and we hung out and played Nintendo games :p It was lots of fun :) My Mom got to embarrass me :p I think her pain pills made her even more crazy :p After Gene left I talked to my Mom and watched t.v. Then he messaged me and asked if I could go swimming with him and Jesse and my Mom actually said yes :D Yay! It was lots of fun :) Gene and I got to kiss and make out :) and play around in the water. I really enjoyed it :) Then Jesse drove me home and I ate dinner, baked potatoes, chicken and corn on the cob :p It was pretty good :) After dinner I took a really hot and long bath :)  It felt really good to relax :) Then I watched t.v. till around 11 and then went to bed. That was pretty much it :) "

Gene showed up around 12:30 and I was still in my pajamas, cause I had been waiting for my clothes to dry :p so I had to hurry and get dressed and go downstairs to answer the door. I was soo happy to see him :) We talked and I showed him my messy room :p and then we went outside and sat in the grass and talked for awhile. We ended up making out in the front yard :p I love kissing him :) Well by the time we were done or whatever he had to go cause he was almost late to be picked up. He told me later that he had to run the whole way :p Overall yesturday was a GREAT day! :) "

First and foremost, she is my girlfriend :p  And I love her very much :) And nothing will ever change that!  But I also did want to say one thing, just so that everybody knows, she is afraid of worms :p  Ok, maybe scared isn't the correct term.  I will just say this... She can jump six feet in the air, even if she does deny it :p  There is a whole little story to that, but I am not going to start explaining that now.. I have to get some sleep :)  Its 2:22 am, and I want to go to sleep so that I can have wonderful dreams :) "
26399,4110791,"01,August,2004",2004-08-01,"    My birthday was Friday! I turned 17! I had my party at my Dad's house. I invited Gene ( :) ), David, James and Rhiannon. They all came and we had a blast. Penny, Gerry, Morgonne, Heather, and Nick came too. Its was one of the best birthdays I've had! We swam in the pool. Even though the water was freezing cold we all had lots of fun. Gene shivered a lot, so for once it wasn't me shivering :p So I got to make fun of him for that :p I liked hanging out with my friends and having lots of fun. I wish we could do it more often :s Ohh well. School is starting September 1st. I can't wait! I'm excited about my classes and that its my last year in high school, but I think I'm most excited about being able to see certain people everyday :) Well thats all I wanted to say :p "
26400,4110791,"08,August,2004",2004-08-08,"   Lets see, Today I woke up at about 8:30... Im suprised that I woke up that early :)  I got up, and then I had a bowl of cereal.  Then Shawn called, and he said that he wanted me to mow the lawn and clean the kitchen, but I ended up mowing the lawn, and Bill cleaned the kitchen :p  When I got done mowing the lawn, and Bill got done cleaning the kitchen, we went to an abandoned house about 3/4 of a mile down our back driveway, and shot .22's around, that was pretty fun :)  Shawn's stupid black lab Ash is going to get shot... She walks right in front of us while we are shooting :S  But, we managed not to shoot her, which is a good thing... Shawn would kill us if we shot his dog :S  Yesterday was alot more fun and interesting than today :)  I went over to Kendall's house at about 12:30, and we played Nintendo games :)  Her mom had a chance to make fun of her, and embarass her, and she did :) Kendall turned red :p I had lots of fun :)  Then at about 4:30 Jesse and I left to go back to his house, and we talked about going swimming, and so when we got back I messaged Kendall to see if she could go swimming with us, I'm very happy that she got to go with us :)  We all had lots of fun :)  Kendall and I got to kiss and make out :) That was lots of fun too :p  After that, Jesse drove Kendall home, and then we went back to his house for about a half an hour, and left for my house :)  For some reason nobody beleive's me when I say that I live a long ways out in the country :p  After I got home, I ate dinner.  Steak and potato salad, it was really good :)  After that we all watched Bull Riding, because there wasnt anything else good on, and because Shawn likes to watch Bull Riding :p  After that, it was about 11:00 and I went to bed :)  Even though I didnt fall asleep until at least 12:30... that was the last time I looked at the clock :S  But I eventually went to sleep, and had very sweet dreams :) "
26401,4110791,"04,August,2004",2004-08-04,"   Today I got up at 4:40 AM, because Bill and Zach (Bill's cousin) wanted to go fishing.  We had to go in with Tina when she went to work, otherwise we would have been stuck at home :p  So we loaded everything up, and went to town.  Tina had a flat tire, so I aired it up at the shell station.  While I was doing that Bill went inside to get us some burrito's breakfast, sandwiches, mountain dew, and pepsi.  Then we were on our way, and we went to a fishing spot right behind Bill's Aunt Kelly's house.  We were going catfishing, but we didn't have any luck.  We caught 15, but they were too small to keep :S  During the time that we were there, I ended up going to the shell station 3 times to get Bill and Zach something to eat or drink :p  I was watching the watch and waiting very patiently for 12 o'clock to come around, so that I could walk over to Kendall's house :)  I ended up being delayed for about 20 minutes, because Zach got his fishing line into a big knot, and so we just put some new line on it because the   line was a few years old :p  After that I left for Kendall's house :)  I got there at 12:40, and rang the doorbell, but nobody answered :p  Kendall was still in bed.. I think she was sleeping, but she said that she was just reading a book :)  I got to see Kendall's room, which is cleaner than my room at the current point in time :p  Even if she said that it was a big mess :)  Oh and I saw some pictures of Kendall when she was younger :)  Then Kendall and I went outside and talked for a little bit.  Oh, and by the way... Grass has a heart and soul :p  We ended up making out,:)  I don't know how long we were outside for, but by the time we checked the time, it was 1:56. I was supposed to meet Bill and Zach at 1:30 so that we could go to his Aunt's house, but I was a little late.  They asked me why i was late, and I just told them that I was preoccupied :)  When we all got home, we went down to an old abandoned house that is just about half a mile down our back driveway.  We brought wheel barrel's down there a  loaded up a whole bunch of wood, because we are going to have a fire, and stuff :p (It was Bill's idea) And then we had our fire, and all I could think about was wishing that Kendall were there to enjoy it with me :S "

18583,4127797,"09,August,2004",2004-08-09,"   Funny how the GOP spinsters were eager to say that Kerry would receive a ""bounce"" of up to 12 points in the poll.  This despite the fact that most polls indicate that far fewer than 12% were ""persuadable"".  True to form, the Republican crew was quick to point out that Kerry did not receive the large bounce that they predicted.  And, of course, the pundits were quick to echo this sentiment throughout the media.  The ""Echo Chamber"" at it's best.  However, the point of the convention was not necessarily to deliver a knock-out blow as did Clinton in '92 and '96, but to give the country their first taste of John Kerry the man.  Going into the convention, Kerry was badly losing the ""nice guy"" contest as well as several other key indicators, including who would best handle Iraq and the war on terror.   OK, OK.  Rather than go through my analysis, I'll point you all to two other sources that are quite detailed:   urlLink http://www.democracycorps.com/reports/index.html   urlLink http://www.americanprogress.org/site/pp.asp?c=biJRJ8OVF&amp;b=134332   So, despite the negative comments by all the pundits, it appears as though the convention was much more positive than it is given credit for.  Kerry has made up some ground in several key areas.  ---  Analysis aside, there were several moments during the convention that stood out the most.  Yes, being in the Fleet Center during John Kerry's acceptance speech was a definite highlight.  But Johnk Kerry's leadership was most highlighted by speeches by Gen. Wesley Clark and former Senator Max Cleland as well as his swift boat crewmates.  Despite the constant claims to the contrary, Kerry described his main objectives and pointed everyone to his website for the more detailed descriptions.  All in all, I'd say Thursday culminated a week that demonstrated Johnk Kerry's commitment to his country.  I with the paid pundits paid a little more attention to the actual content of the convention instead of editorializing throughout every speech.  Other moments of note include watching John Edwards speech at a bar with a bunch of strangers and having a good time.  Barack Obama's speech definitely lived up to the hype I had given it.  He spoke with such eloquence and passion about the Democrats' desire for unity and moving forward.  His comments reiterated the positive message of opportunity and unity by Bill Clinton on the conventions opening night.   What wasn't on TV or anywhere else was a speech by Senator Joe Biden to the college Democrats, perhaps the best I've ever heard.  He called for mutual sacrifice and mutual benefits in a time of increased security risks.  His message of unity included the fact that ""rich people are patriotic too"" -- something that too many people on the left fail to recognize and appreciate.  There are plenty of wealthy liberals out there, reason to take a second look at the traditional class warfare that so many on the left try to fight.  Progress, in my opinion, will be more quickly realized when we work together instead of dividing ourselves on class lines.  The conservatives try to divide the country by race, religion, etc.  Progressives should not try to resort to similar strategies.  For me, the choice in November is now clear: unity, hope and opportunity or division, fear, and the status quo.  My vote is for the former.   "

1953,4128156,"03,August,2004",2004-08-03,"   Blowing the Whistle on the Watchtower re: sales tax fraud             The following letter was mailed out in quantity to the 50 states (Sales Tax Fraud Divisions) in early 1997.         The collecting of sales tax by peddlers from customers is required in 49 of the 50 states [except,N.H.]       For a full report on the fraudulent nature of the Watchtower in this regard, read:  The Watchtower Way of Laundering Money @ my home page.                Earlier the Watchtower organization suffered a defeat along with Jimmy Swaggart. The previously-mentioned article says,  ""Just one month before the new policy was announced, the Society watched how the Supreme Court ruled in California Board of Equalization vs. Jimmy Swaggart Ministries.       California wanted to assess sales taxes on the sale of books and tapes and other items by Swaggart's ministry.  The Watch Tower Society filed amicus curiae  (a friend of the court legal brief)  in support of Swaggart's position,  that a religious organization should be exempt from such taxation.         On Jan. 17, 1990, just a little over a month before the Society's change in policy, the Supreme Court ruled against Swaggart and permitted taxation. The Society's new policy avoided any liability for taxation by taking the financial transaction out of the picture (donations cannot be taxed).""       While the Watchtower's ""new policy"" shielded them from a lawsuit by the State of California (and subsequent others) , they continued to peddle the magazines and books from door-to-door (and to this day), mentioning contributions and although not saying a specific amount to the householder to give, the Witness peddler himself has to come up with the ""value amount"" of the literature and give it back to the Kingdom Hall to send to Brooklyn. If not enough funds come in according to their evaluation of the ""value"" of the literature, the Watchtower's literature supply desk will halt the flow of all literature to the local Kingdom Hall until the ""bill"" has been paid.                 This is still currently the hypocritical practice as of March 2003 .  I also included in the mailings a copy of David Reed's book Blood On the Altar. Some states wrote back; their reply was basically ""Thank you,"" or that they will process the request of the Watchtower's abuse.  Here is a facsimile of the letter I write in 1997:      Danny Haszard P. O. Box 15449 Boston, MA 02215     ATTN:  Certified Mail to Criminal Investigation Tax Fraud Division To all 50 states and all I.R.S. Offices  January 15, 1997  Dear Tax Office,       I am writing to   blow the whistle   on an organization I used to belong to, an organization that is selling millions of dollars of merchandise in this state without collecting sales tax. The Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of New York ships truckloads of books, videos, tapes and assorted other merchandise to their Kingdom Halls across the state. The members take these items from there and sell them house-to-house, returning the money collected to the Kingdom Hall, so that it can be mailed back to Brooklyn headquarters each month. They talk about ""donations"" but this is a thinly veiled tax-dodging sales operation. Dunn & Bradstreet reports for recent years show their sales in the $1 billion range, so the Jehovah's Witness are certainly selling $--millions in this state.  The religious publishing operations and bookstores connected with other churches are collecting and paying sales tax.  As a taxpayer, I am writing to blow the whistle and to ask what is going to be done about the Watchtower's tax evasion.

Beware of Love Bombing:      Leonard Brenner Love-bombing is characteristic of most cults. Prospects, recruits and members are drowned in a sea of love and caring. Recently in an evangelical church I heard the pastor describe his visit to two cultic groups in which he praised their love-bombing and urged that his church adopt the same loving attitude towards visitors and members.         Should the evangelical church practice love-bombing? Is this what Christ meant when he said, ""By this will all men know that you are My disciples, if you have love for one another,"" (John 13:35)?       I've heard cult members say, ""Of course we practice love-bombing: Who'd want to be in a group or church that practiced hate-bombing?""       This attitude highlights a common misconception.  >>>Hate-bombing is not the opposite of love-bombing.       The opposite of love-bombing is unconditional love. Love-bombing is highly conditional. The cults will love you to death while you represent a prospective convert to their group.          As a member a tight family love will surround you as you faithfully promote their cause. However, when it is clear that a prospect will not join the group or a member voices doubts, create waves, or leaves the group, all love ceases.        Indeed scorn is immediately heaped on these individuals and remaining members are told not to have any contact with them. All time, effort and love-bombing is then directed towards new prospects and the faithful members. Is this the love evangelical churches should practice?  Unconditional love  is what God practiced when he sent his Son to die for us?  "

From his studies of the Bible, Miller determined that the second coming would happen sometime between 1843-1844. A spectacular meteor shower in 1833 gave the movement a good push forward. The build up of anticipation continued until March 21, 1844, when Miller's one year time table ran out. Some followers set another date of Oct 22, 1844. This too failed, collapsing the movement.

Then Charles Taze Russell predicted the Rapture in 1910, followed by End of the World in 1914--later interpreted as invisible return of Christ. (99 Reasons Why No One Knows When Christ Will Return, by B J Oropeza, Foreward by Hank Hanegraaff, IVP publishing, 1994)       1914   was one of the more important estimates of the start of the war of Armageddon by the Jehovah's Witnesses (Watchtower Bible and Tract Society). They computed 1914 from prophecy in the book of Daniel, Chapter 4. The writings referred to ""seven times"". The WTS interpreted each ""time"" as equal to 360 days, giving a total of 2520 days. This was further interpreted as representing 2520 years, measured from the starting date of 607 BCE. This gave 1914 as the target date.    1914  Charles Russell, after being exposed to the teachings of William Miller, founded his own organization - the Jehovah's Witnesses. In 1914 Russell predicted the return of Jesus Christ.    1914, 1918, 1920, 1925, 1941, 1975 and 1994   Jwâ€™s: Here are other dates that the Watchtower Society predicted. 1975 looked likely as it was computed as the 6000th anniversary of the creation of Adam in the Garden of Eden in 4026 BCE. They interpreted Psalms 90:10 as defining the length of a generation to be 80 years. Since 1914 plus 80 equals 1994, they predicted Armageddon would occur around that year. The latest estimate was 6000 years after the creation of Eve, for which no date can be determined with any accuracy.    1914  End of World; Charles T. Russel, Jehovah's Witnesses; later explained that Michael (ie Jesus) had defeated Satan in heaven    1914  ; Jesus invisible and quiet return to the Earth. (Jehovah's Witnesses, Book: This Means Everlasting Life, page 221) ""So A.D. 1914 marks the time of Christ's invisible return in spirit."" Explained after they said he would return in 1914          1918  In 1918, new math didn't help the Jehovah's Witnesses from striking out again.           1925  The Witnesses had no better luck in 1925. They already possessed the title of most wrong predictions. They would expand upon it in the years to come.    1953-AUG:   David Davidson wrote a book titled ""The Great Pyramid, Its Divine Message"". In it, he predicted that the world would end in 1953-AUG.    1957-APR:  The Watchtower magazine, quoted (1) a pastor from California, Mihran Ask, as saying in 1957-JAN that ""Sometime between April 16 and 23, 1957, Armageddon will sweep the world! Millions of persons will perish in its flames and the land will be scorched.'       1975  The Jehovah's Witnesses were back at it in 1975. The failure of the forecast did not affect the growth of the movement. The Watchtower magazine, a major Witness periodical, has over 13 million subscribers.    1975  Armageddon, 1975; Jehovah's Witnesses; (Various publication, cited in Newsweek Oct. 15, 1984)     1984  The Jehovah's Witnesses made sure in 1984 that no one else would be able to top their record of most wrong doomsday predictions. The Witnesses record is currently holding at nine. The years are: 1874, 1878, 1881, 1910, 1914, 1918, 1925, 1975, and 1984. Lately, the JW's are claiming they're out of the prediction business, but it's hard to teach an old dog new tricks. They'll be back.

7570,4128797,"14,August,2004",2004-08-14,"   Alien vs. Predator seems like an idiot proof concept to me.   Take bad ass villain one and bad ass villain two, thrown in human cannon fodder, much chaos and action ensures.   A toddler could nearly write this movie.  Hell this concept is perfect for the typical movie writing formula of concept first, movie momentâ€™s seconds, finally the story.    Here concept is alien vs. predator, movie moments is much action occurs where two beat crap out of each other while the fodder dies, the story would be what ever takes you from action point to action point.  Real simple.  Idiot proof.  Sadly Alien vs. Predator (directed and written by Paul W.S. Anderson) is proof that nothing is idiot-proof.   Somehow, someway, the director/writer screwed up this concept.   The story is crap but who cares.  The human fodder crap, but again who cares.   One thing that sucks is 20 minutes was spent establishing the fodder.  Time wasted away from the action.   Here is the problem.  What action?  Where is the Alien vs. Predator?  If looking for that, you are not going to find a whole lot.  There are maybe two action sequences in this movie.   One is a bad ass CGI flash back; the other was a decent sequence that quickly turned stupid.     Maybe you are thinking that at least get to see the Aliens and the Predator do their own bad ass things.  Well, kind of, sometimes.  Mostly the Predators come across as ugly humans.  Another words they are incompetent.  The Aliens act mostly Alien like except they sure do grow up fast and make use of the acid way to much.  Also the Alien Queenâ€¦yeah suddenly here she is T-Rex size and acts just like one too.   Basically Anderson stripped away all the coolness of these characters.  They are pale shadows of the original creations.  The only reason I can think this occurred is the usual Hollywood arrogance.  In this case Anderson saw the movies as a kid like 15 years ago and declared himself expert.  Through that haze of memory, a lot of decisions at least track.  After all how bad ass can a Predator is is got beat up by Governor Schwarzenegger (thus incompetent) or that Alien Queen got killed by Weaver (thus the T-Rex Alien is born).  Itâ€™s all I got as explanation because nothing else makes sense.  About the only good thing in this movie are the CGI moments.  Thatâ€™s the only time this movie was good when it was obvious some CGI team did the sequence instead of that retarded director.  Also the Alien and Predator costumes etc are top notch.  Those teams deserve a pat on the back.  Basically this movie is Joel Schumacher level fuck up.   A franchise has been utterly demolished under this imbecileâ€™s hand (how these incompetent directors continue to get work baffles me).   I could go further but letâ€™s put it this way; the Predator only killed one Alien.  Thatâ€™s it.  The rest where just blown up.  That alone should indicate how little â€œvs.â€ occurred in this movie. "
7571,4128797,"08,August,2004",2004-08-08,"   Bush Protestors Turned Away From Event  Aug 5, 2004 6:23 am US/Central Mankato, Minn. (AP) Two young supporters of DFL congressional candidate Leigh Pomeroy were turned away from President Bush's quarry rally in Mankato yesterday.   Nick Burkhardt and Matt Klaber of Mankato initially were denied rally tickets after making unfavorable comments about the president while waiting in line for three hours. They later were given tickets, but when they got off the shuttle bus at the quarry they were told they couldn't go in.   They agreed to leave, but a Mankato West High School teacher who was accompanying them says he also was asked to leave when he tried to defend the boys.   Global geography teacher Jim Walz said he wanted to stay and was told by a Bush official that he would be arrested and escorted out if he made any attempt to protest during the rally.   Walz says if appearances by the President of the United States are treated as private political events, then cities are right to bill the campaign for the expenses of local law enforcement.   Source: http://wcco.com/siteSearch/local_story_218072505.html  ---------- Sigh. It saddens me how much freedom people are willing to give up for ""safety"". Even sadder that people that should know better don't have a problem with it. It started with protest only areas (for safety of course  ) now its spread to support agreements and risk of arrest for even COMMENTING negativily about the president. Sometimes slippery slope logic doesn't apply, but when it comes to rights, it does. As the Bush Administration has proven over and over and over and over again for the last 4 years.  Seriously both sides of the aisle should have serious problems with this.   Not even allowed to comment negativily. I think thats sick and any candidate or person, even Bush acolytes, that doesn't condemn it is un-American and a traitor. Screw Bush's and Coulters definition, theirs is limited to the Republican party. "

7573,4128797,"05,August,2004",2004-08-05,"   Just got back from watching The Village.  Was bored silly.  Once again M. Night Schmalyan (schmalyn? bah can't spell it and too lazy to look) crafted a technically good movie that would be good for directing classes in college...but not a particularly interesting or even entertaining movie.  You have most of the ingredients, good cast, acting, plot, set and so forth.  Its just the actually story itself is boring.  Also the movie is just so damn sloooooooow.   You thought Signs developed slowly...this one is practically glacial in pace.    As for the twist...its ok.  Really not bad, more creative then what 99.9% of other Hollywood writers would have come up with...except you really just don't care.  The problem is you really don't care about the characters and even if you did the twist effects them but doesn't really involve them personally.  So you are ""oh okay /shrug"" instead of ""ooh ahhh"".    In the end though this movie suffers from the failure of room number one that any movie should aspire to - entertain the damn audience.  This movie was simply boring.  My rating for this movie: wait for cable...better yet wait till free on network TV couple of years from now. "

6603,4129418,"20,August,2004",2004-08-20,"   the hippie and i have noticed that we fall rather naturally into very distinct, traditional gender roles. our friends notice it. and the other night, it was very very apparent that our friends jenn and harry do the same. i mean, we went to their house for dinner, which was grilled by the men, after being prepared by the women. then after dinner--jenn put the baby to bed and i started knitting while the boys retired to the deck for pipe/ceegar smoking, and some scotch drinking on the hippie's part. and then jenn came back and we both knitted.  the hippie was telling me later that he and harry were on the porch talking about how cute it was that we were knitting, and how they both get a sense of satisfaction out of us being so girlie. funny--i get a sense of satisfaction out of him doung ""guy things"" as well.  and yes, i am pretty comfortable with this. it is bizarre to me HOW comfortable i am with it. i mean, i have multiple degrees and have always been pretty damned independent. but this last year and a half with the hippie, i have learned that there is a bit of joy in codependence. i LIKE our gender roles. i like that i do most of the cooking and he does most of the heavy lifting. i like that i make the drinks for our friends who are over while he entertains them. i like the whole set-up, and how much i feel like he is taking care of me, while i am taking care of him.  the weird thing is that i feel no less a feminist for all this. i am glad i have choices in things, and that i have had the opportunity to do what i want with my life. i am grateful to the women who came before me for fighting so that i could have those choices. i am glad i have the same rights and the same power as he does. i like that he listens to me and that he respects my brain even while he is grabbing my ass.  i like that this weekend, harry and the hippie are off having a boys weekend, playing D&amp;D, going to hooters, and probably seeing something awful like alien vs. predator (which i will get out of going to see thank god!!!), while jenn and i get to be girls and go on a ninja ikea run.  this is a great time to be a girl. you get to have it all.

6606,4129418,"16,August,2004",2004-08-16,"   there is not enough room on the entire internet for me to talk about all my mixed feelings on this topic, so i am going to try to sum it up.  right now--fucking hate it. loathe it. dread it every day with every fiber of my being. i go to the gym, i feel self-conscious the ENTIRE time i am there, i count the minutes till my workout is over, and i am exhausted when i get home. half the time it is all i can do not the throw up on the treadmill. it is all i can do to make myself go.  and sometimes i don't, and it fills me with self-loathing.  but here is the thing. i need it. i know i need it. i know that this is a change i need to make for the good of me, my body, my future health, the future health of my possible future children, and the happiness of my hippie, too. (not because he judges me, but because he worries about my health.) right now i am heavier than i have ever been, and i feel it all through my body. my energy is lower, my blood pressure is higher--i have to take medication, which then makes me even more sluggish. and if i can get myself to consistently work out, then all that will definitely change.  i know that eventually i will come to like it. i know that eventually i will even look forward to it. i know because that has happened to me in the past. i long for the day when my workout ends with endorphins instead of exhaustion. and i know it will come if i keep it up.  but here is the thing about gyms today. this gym we go to pushes the personal trainer like nobody's business. and damn, how the hell can anyone afford one? a woman at the gym actually suggested to me that i get my boyfriend to pay for it when i explained to her that i just could not afford it! holy crap! do i have to pay out hundreds and hundreds of dollars to someone so that i will feel guilty enough about NOT working out that i do it? i have to make myself accountable to another person to follow through with a commitment to myself now???  and the other thing i totally fucking hate is how these trainers are so goal oriented. ""we need to get your body fat percentage down to blah."" ""what is your goal weight?"" who the hell cares about that!? i know, and anyone who has read anything about anything knows that this is all just simple math. if you put more calories in than you expend, you gain weight, and vice versa. further, losing a massive amount of weight is only possible with a lifetime commitment to a lifestyle change, whether you need to eat less, work out more, or both. i mean, why can't i just focus on getting this shit into my daily routine. why do i have to think about my goal weight and how low i need my body fat percentage to be? that shit overwhelms me and makes me want to crawl into a hole and give up and go ahead and die of a heart attack.  screw that.  and man, i know self discipline and denial are so not my strong suits. but damn. i can do this.

I feel this way when I am feeling emotion that i dont know how to interpet i dont really know if its sadness or joy i feel now all i know is im feeling a lot of it. I can often feel the way the ppl around me feel I interpret what they are feeling and i in turn feel that way. that is the reason im the way i am. i focus on understanding what other feel and how others act sometimes i forget about me. But hey there are a lot of ppl who are more interesting than me. thats why I am a rounded person I take the cool parts of my friends and i become that, so i feel better about myself. I guess that makes me a huge phony but hey if you are gonna do something might as well be convicted.... or not whatever   i guess im done for now   "
4510,4129852,"03,August,2004",2004-08-03,"   Wow  one thing you may realize while hanging out with rem is that he is very immoral he has almost no conscience its rediculous. I guess he makes up for it kinda he is nice to like evry one. But he has a serious problem unless he hurst some one he really cares about he wont give a shit. He has conned a lot of ppl out of money he is good at it he doesnt mind. But he hates it when ppl dislike for no reason he tries to make everyione happy see he is the con-man that wants to be everyone's best friend.  One thing he needs to work on is evaluating risk and having the balls to fallow through with the capable some situations are easily avoidable if you can think through the possibilities. Normally Rem is good at it but lately he has been lacking in this skill  ""hey, Love does funny things to yah"" says rem.  I dont even know why im writing this one Rem just wanted to sill his guts on some things so here I am writing for him.   "

Although there is someone else who always makes you laugh, your eyes and attention might go only to that special someone. Then, you are in love. Although that special someone was supposed to have called you long back, to let you know of their safe arrival, your phone is quiet. You are desperately waiting for the call! At that moment, you are in love. If you are much more excited for one short e-mail from that special someone than other many long e-mails, you are in love.

14283,4138081,"04,August,2004",2004-08-04,"    ""To fear love is to fear life, and those who fear life are already three parts dead.""- Bertrand Russell. This is a very interesting quote I found in a book I'm reading. To fear love, a big part of life, would be the same as fearing life. You would fear the only things you care for and care for you hopefully. Fearing life would be fearing all things including the good with the bad. Happiness is an emotion that keeps us alive and without love, it's not an emotion you will feel. Do not fear love. It may hurt and tear you apart, but you musn't hide from it. You'll never know if the feeling is mutual or not unless you find out for yourself. Show your love and express it with the greatest enotion possible. Show people you are happy and you live and love to the best you can. This seems like a hard thing to do. Trust me, it is. But you can't live in fear for your whole life. That's not what inspires people to want to be around you. Understand that life will bring you happiness when you want it. Not when you need it. Looking for happiness and living for happiness are two different things. Live to find happiness. Show you are happy and people will follow.   "
14284,4138081,"04,August,2004",2004-08-04,"    ""Never regret. If it's good, it's wonderful. If it's bad, it's experience.""- Victoria Holt. This is an interesting quote that I found the other day. The purpose of this quote is to recognize that everything happens for a reason. Every choice you make can either be bad or good. The bad ones allow you to learn from this mistake and apply what you've learned to your everyday life. The good ones give you some type of happiness that you don't have to regret doing. Life has twists and is going to throw some crazy ones your way so your going to make some bad decisions, but hopefully you'll learn from them and fix it so that you will live happy. Regreting something is the same as feeling bad for yourself. Don't do it and you can't be depressed. Forget the past and learn from it.   "
14285,4138081,"04,August,2004",2004-08-04,"    Writing is more than an assignment by a teacher or just making a book. Writing is a state of mind that allows you to use your mind as a tool and understand things better. You endulge in your own world and make your own rules. Noone can bother you because you are so focused that your mind blocks everything out allowing you to continue. The best thing about writing is the feeling you get after you write. You feel complete because you were able to tell your true feelings. Even if you write by yourself and allow noone to read your writings, that feeling is still shown. My writings will be based on truth and my feelings so I hope you enjoy them. I will show facts about life, love, the world, and many other subjects that purtain to you and me. Hopefully both you and I will learn something from my writings. Quote of the day ""I never think of the future - it comes soon enough.""- Albert Einstein. My explanation for this quote is that you must live life one day at a time. Don't worry about the future to come. It will come and you will see what happens either way. Forget about fear of death and think about life. The future is unpredictable so stop trying to figure it out. Life will give to you what's rightfully yours. This will in turn make you much happier because fear will be a lost emotion.   "

Fairbanks    This blog was created as a way for me to tell the world about a movie. This is know normal movie, it's not a fancy hollywood production, and it's not at all pretty. It is, in fact, a REVELATION. The official documentary .  Life And Times In McMinnville   Ah, yes, Levi Fairbanks's directorial debut, an epiphany of pure scientific genius. Not for sell anywhere, and a rare find, but if you have the luck to get your hands on a copy, you, too, will be able to revel in it's pure brilliance, such a gem that you might have to wear sunglasses while you are watching.

31032,4150492,"10,August,2004",2004-08-10,"   I hate shopping for clothes when you know you need them, but also know that you have gained a bit of weight since setteling down and want to lose a good 20 lbs. My hunt: Plain simple black pants for work, easy no?? NO!! I went to 15 differnt stores and tried on every stupid pair I saw, (expensive or not) and got more and more depressed as this charade wore on. With sales people screaming, ""Can I help you??"", ""Oh, what's wrong they didn't fit??"", ""Did you not like them?"", with fake smiles and stupid faces, AARRRGGHHHHHH !!! As I walked away I felt like eating a big tub or french fries floating in vinigar to drown away my pain. Instead, I had a mint.  "
31033,4150492,"08,August,2004",2004-08-08,"   It been an amasing journey. Life, i'm talking about. Have you ever thought about where you we're, where you are and where you want to be...it's almost life thereatining if you think about this too much because life will take it's due course weather you want it to or not. I once thought I can make life do whatever I wanted it to. Once I finally got off my high horse and realised that life will do what it wants to and you can only stall whats bound to happen or veer it one way or another, life took on a whole new meaning for me. For example: Love, I only found the one I love recently and it is sooo hard. To know that your morals are different, your interests are different, and quite possibly your lifetime goals are different is tough, especially when you think you could, quite possibly, want to spend the rest of your life with this person. How are you to figure if there will be conflict later when all the signs point to yes and you've spent your life trying, and quite succesfully I might add, avoiding conflict all together. Is dirct conflict a part of life? Because I quite firmly believe (such as I did in ""directing life"") that conflict can be avoided all together, if dealing with the right person. Am I making any sense? Probably not. Anyways, I believe I've quite said enough. I am a private person and already feel uncomfortable with what i've said thus far. Goodnight...xoxo  I never realized how liberating writing on some site, that possibly, but probably never will be viewed...lets go of all the things you've bottled up inside but we're never able to tell anyone you we're really close to. Can I actually let myself let go on this thing??? Blogger.com, who'd a thunk it.  "

Sharing my thoughts and complaints on the internet, I dunno might as well just say them, no?  FINE...you twisted my rubber arm. Tee hee, my two friends and I are going to this retro 80's party tonight and we went to Village des Valeurs and bought thiese unbelieveable FROCKS!!!

10468,4151531,"17,August,2004",2004-08-17,   A friend of mine told me that blogging is just for people who dont have lives...but i think some of us just have an ingrained desire to write and attract attention to ourselves...or it could be that blogging is the ultimate activity for desk-bound workers in this country who exercize an increasingly endangered personal freedom to say anything we want.   
10469,4151531,"11,August,2004",2004-08-11,"   now that i am listening to npr in the morning instead of hip-hop, r and b, and old-school, i am very much worried.  a few days ago i thought that it would be impossible for bush to win the election but now im not so sure.  theres the florida problem again.  i also think that it is hard to get a sense of the direction the nation is moving in from the bay area.  i dont know how useful it is to go to meet-ups or rallies or fund-raisers in this area.  instead of preaching to the choir, i think the efforts should be increased in the swing states.  i would like to go on a 'logic train' campaign across the country and sit down with undecided voters and speak to them.  but this requires critical thought and intelligence...  which brings me to a bigger almost blasphemous notion:  is democracy really that great?  the admin trumpets it all over the world (even though many countries are not ready for democracy) as if it could be implemented as a shake-and-bake set-up (easy bake democracy oven...ready in five minutes or less!!).  if you look at two of the longest periods of peace in the world (amongst large, diverse populations), you will see that neither of them was under a democracy.  im referring specifically to the reign of akbar during the mughal dynasty in india and the pax romana under augustus c.  the former peace was under muslims and the latter, pagans.  the problem with democracy is that currently it does not assume the votership to be educated or possess critical thinking.

6307,4152098,"13,August,2004",2004-08-13,"   No not the ones on four wheels, even though there are a lot of those. Drivers for computer hardware. Had to setup a wireless network for one of my Aunties. One look at the equipment and alarms started to go off. Linksys router.......and D-Link wireless card (-.-);; I've had plenty of experience with Linksys routers so no problems there. The D-Link DWL-G510 though, started to give me chills.  Install went smoothly enough. Drivers installed perfectly fine, WinXP and Zone Alarm said they picked up a new network, I was even able to get on the 'net. Then I thought I'd reboot to make sure everything was dandy.........  BAM, S.O.B. couldn't pick up the router. Tried to adjust settings on the wireless configuration tool from D-Link, P.O.S., then some settings on the router.....nothing. So I uninstalled the drivers and reinstalled them, started picking up the router again....I already knew where this was going. Reboot, GONE.  So then next logoical step was GOOGLE. Thank goodness for google. Found a forum post on Broadbandreports.com, suggested installing drivers from ASUS's wireless card (apparently they share the same wireless chipset), worked like a charm. In closing......  DIE D-LINK DIE "

18080,4154216,"20,August,2004",2004-08-20,"   I feel rather ancient today, if truth be told... Yesterday I finally organised insurance cover for Luci to drive my car. I've never been a great one for white-knuckle rides, but have to say that her driving was really quite reasonable. After all, an unexpected traffic bollard after a mini- roundabout might surprise anyone,- and there is no doubt that her braking is excellent! However, nothing had prepared me for the realisation that this is another milestone on the journey into an independent life in which I'll have minimal part.Of course I'd known all along that parenthood is the gradual process of working yourself out of a job, but yesterday I realised something of how it will  feel . This morning we went in to school to collect A/S results..again there is nothing I can do to fix these if they don't work for her (thankfully she managed A's in English and Philosophy, with B's for History,Music and Gen. Studies...she's cross that History and Philos. werent reversed, but otherwise quite content) Lunch time she boarded a train for a 4 day trawl around assorted northern universities...and there she was, gone! I know she'll be back on Tuesday (albeit briefly) but this is a foretaste at least....methinks I have some preparation to do before I'm ready for autumn 05,not least because I'm not that sure I've done all my own growing up yet. "
18081,4154216,"18,August,2004",2004-08-18,"   Not quite sure where this week has gone: 3 funerals in 2 days probably has alot to do with the speed at which time hurtles past...Yesterday's was special. No. Let me rephrase that. I know they are  ALL  special to the families involved, and believe me we do our utmost to ensure that they feel this. I rather think God does too.Inevitably, though, you engage differently in different contexts, and some touch you personally more than others. Yesterday's was for a lady whom I'd been privileged to spend a long afternoon with, only a few days before she died. We had taken her Communion, stayed on for a cup of tea, and then been stranded thanks to prolonged and violent thunderstorms..She and her husband were clearly devoted, and as they shared stories and memories, knowing that their time was likely to be short, I really did feel that we were on holy ground. When we had visited to discuss the funeral, he had worried that maybe not many people would attend, though the forest of cards all over the house suggested this might be unlikely. In the event, the church was full and the little house afterwards overflowed with love and concern, under which the family blossomed. I honestly think they enjoyed the experience...realising that the wife and mother who was so precious to them was loved and valued in so many different contexts. It made me realise just how valuable those letters and cards you struggle to send in the aftermath of a death can be....and how much more so the hugs and memories. "
18082,4154216,"14,August,2004",2004-08-14,"   Thank you to everyone who prayed, supported and responded to yesterday's blog....It would be too much to say that things are brighter today, but the weight of misery is maybe slightly less overwhelming. Professionally, the day is one of weddings, which makes a nice change from the recent run of funerals: I can't actually conduct the things yet, of course, but I did have a jolly time acting as unofficial creche for assorted infants and toddlers who clearly felt that all that was necessary had been said within the first two minutes of the service. So  we  played in the sunshine and ""they"" did the grown up bits inside the church....and a good time was had by all.:-) "
18083,4154216,"13,August,2004",2004-08-13,"   Since my beloved youngest child was born on this day 12 years ago, I've always claimed a particular fondness for 13ths in general, and Friday 13th in particular. This year I'm rather uncertain, though. The day has featured one  deeply  unhappy parishioner, two funerals plus a funeral visit and most seriously the awareness of the huge pain that one of my dearest friends is going through, and which I can do nothing to alleviate. I had never seen myself as a Mrs Fixit but clearly I have these tendencies...to no avail. All I can do is stand at the foot of the cross and weep......for which, of course, there is rather a precedent. I know I'm not alone there, though, and this has helped me to get through the day and even manage to play birthday jollities with the boy himself. Thanks to those whose companionship in the sadness made this more possible. "
18084,4154216,"12,August,2004",2004-08-12,"   Maggi's blog,  here , carries some interesting thoughts about the role of those passages of Scripture, liturgy et al that we actually know by heart.....which sent me off on a roundabout track to consider how much our ideas (and specificially our theological ideas) are actually   created   by the words with which we express them. That may sound bizarre at first, and I do know the dangers of locating God within a particular form of service of type of language.After all, I'm a curate in the sort of traditional Anglican parish where, when we introduce the Lord's prayer with the words ""As our Saviour taught us, so we pray..."" a high proportion of the congregation assume that this means that Jesus did indeed instruct his disciples to pray in the English of 1611 ;-). Nonetheless, I'm sure I'm not unique in finding that certain patterns of language effect me in a way that others, carrying the same meaning, do not...The Common Worship Evening Prayer includes an updated version of one of the familiar collects, retains the meaning exactly, but totally loses the effect...Why is this? Is it purely the resonance of countless Evensongs of my chorister past...or is there something inherently special about the words selected and arranged thus...Some words, I'm sure, are themselves Sacraments...they achieve what they symbolise or describe. For me, the final stanza of John Donne's ""Hymne to God the Father"",  urlLink Here , does just that, and has done so ever since I read it in a train between Eastbourne and St Leonards on Sea, going home from school.to confront a new world, the day my father died. Whenever I read it, as I have so many times through the years, the same tangible certainty that all shall be well surrounds me once again, and I do indeed ""feare no more"". I suspect this may be a glimpse of the blindingly obvious, and something others have considered long since....but, hey, I had fun cogitating anyway, and nobody forced you to read to the bitter end, did they?? PS If anyone felt moved to teach me how to do those links that would take you direct to a specific section of Maggi's blog (and indeed anyone else's)..., I'd be one up on the superteen Giles, and seriously, if not eternally, grateful! "
18085,4154216,"11,August,2004",2004-08-11,"   Today, my day off, I decided to redeem myself with the children by a Proper Day Out. After an entertaining visit to the orthodontist, who had moved practice to the other side of Cheltenham without warning, so that we found her only after frantic drive across town....for an appointment that must have taken a good 45 seconds..we headed south to Somerset and Kilve. Amazing beach, with huge stones, and terraced rocks which make most convincing sleeping dragons...plus handy cave for lunch in the rain. All very happy, then as rain intensified and swimming looked increasingly unlikely, we went in search of Exmoor ponies and Lorna Doone. En route through some of the most beautifully wild country I've enjoyed for a while, we saw a sign to 12th century church....Children agreed we could divert, as reward for good behaviour....but have to say I wish we hadn't. The church itself was tiny and quite appealing...on the edge of a tiny hamlet of 10 houses. It houses the smallest and least threatening pulpit I've ever encountered:not so much ""6 feet above contradiction"" as ""a small step above uncertainty"". Amazingly it claimed to have both a vicar and a curate (the former being known as The Rev and the latter as Fr....which intrigued me mildly) and was actually planning to hold a service this coming w'end, Evensong taking place every 3rd Sunday...But what reduced me to silent misery was the fact that it was stuffed...and I mean STUFFED...with dead flowers. Three arrangements in the sanctuary, one by the font....they simply shouted of despair and desolation. Here, in the middle of all the tourist routes, signposted from 3 directions, was a church saying ""We are dead. We are irrelevant. Even we don't care any more....why should you?"" G remarked in some disgust that only I could find myself in the middle of Exmoor doing theological reflections about dead flowers....sadly, I fear he might not be right...and that others might also see it this way. "
18086,4154216,"09,August,2004",2004-08-09,"   why, when I am endlessly patient with all sorts of unreasonable old ladies, disaffected youths and wobbly clerics, I am totally incapable of remembering for half an hour what it felt like to be 17.... Feeling very ashamed of myself, as I had a Major Row with beloved daughter, who is, not unreasonably, feeling a bit deprived of social life, since I've dragged her 2o miles in the wake of my ordination,  failed so far to insure my car for her to practice driving on, and vanished cheerfully out the door calling ""Mustn't be late for Evening Prayer"" just when she was about to talk to me.... I guess that blogs are not intended as alternative confessionals, and there aint alot of absolution to be had anyway, but I do hope I'm not developing into Rev Jekyll/Mummy Hyde...only worth knowing when I'm in ""uniform"". The thing is, it's not just professional niceness...I really do feel tremendously fond of and concerned for all these people....Of course, I feel considerably fonder and more concerned for my nearest and dearests, but showing it, that's another matter :-( "
18087,4154216,"07,August,2004",2004-08-07,"   This morning I visited a family who come to our ""Prams and Pushchairs"" toddler church...Unusually, they had ASKED for a service of Thanksgiving rather than Baptism for the younger children, and when I met their dad it all made sense. He was a really thoughtful guy, with no churchy pretensions whatsoever, who nonetheless said that he ""respected church too much to make empty promises there"". Impressive, eh? Wish he could chat to some of the other families we encounter.We had a satisfying conversation, and I was just beginning to tear myself away from the delightful baby when her big brother asked me rather sheepishly if I could do a "" sort of prayer thingy for if you're being adopted"". It turned out that this is a second relationship for his mother, and that the father of the girls, is going to adopt J too....I was of course more than happy to agree to include prayers to reflect this in the service, and the grin that spread over J's  face when he realised that not only could he be included in his sisters' special day, but that God might actually want to be involved in his new relationship, was worth almost anything and then a bit more. The family had already asked for the inevitable ""Let the children come to me"" reading, and it was good to be able to tell them that when Jesus placed his hands on the heads of those children he was proclaiming himself their father and protector...adopting them, in fact. Hard to tell which of us was more thrilled, really.....And they call this sort of thing ""work"". I left there with a beautiful drawing of a smiling flower in a pot and a pipecleaner heart to grace the study....and a longing for there to be more moments of revelation, when people grasp that God really does care about them, and the church manages not to put its foot in it and crush their faltering moves towards him.

18088,4154216,"06,August,2004",2004-08-06,"   Well, it's just over a month since I dropped off the clerical production line and landed as a shiney new curate in the parish...A month of new experiences, new people by the hundred (all of whom know ALL about me, including probably where I've put the keys to the vestry) and more joy than I would ever have believed a ""job"" could entail. But today is different. My boss, who is truly wonderful (gentle reader, I refer to the vicar, my more immediate boss, rather than the Boss whom you might presume to be the sole employer of even infant clergy) phoned to say that Sheila died yesterday. She was a wonderful lady. A former PCC secretary who had huge reservations about the ministry of women, she had battled with a particularly unpleasant form of cancer for  nearly 10years, suriving on liquid meal replacements ever since diagnosis. When I first went with Michael to visit her, he warned me that she might be a little cool, given her strong views on ordination. Instead she was both gracious and welcoming, and over 4 weeks we became very good friends as we explored life, death, ministry...and the mysterious attractions of Big Brother. A quick visit last Friday morning turned into nearly 2 hours, we had so much to say to each other. A return trip was in the diary for today...but it's too late. She waited until her daughter and family returned from holiday in the States on Tuesday...fell into a coma on Wednesday and moved on yesterday afternoon. She'd allowed us to come so far along the road with her, it hurts that neither of us were there at the end. Go well, Sheila, straight into the loving arms of God. Thank you for your friendship and your inspiration. I'm so glad I knew you. "
24942,4162455,"18,August,2004",2004-08-18,   We will have a 20 player game at my house this Friday night @ 8:00pm.  We may have a new player from Poker Meetup.  Let me know by email  urlLink jia@akaak.com  before Friday how many you will bring so we can make sure we have enough tables. So far we are estimating approx 20 but can break out a 3rd table if we get more.  
24943,4162455,"07,August,2004",2004-08-07,"   We did not have our normal Friday night game due to Charlie but the next day I headed on over to Derby and joined the 170 player tournament.  I finished 4th and here the notes I emailed Jeff W. >>>  ""Now to the 4th place finish notes. It all started with my lucky ""Quake"" jersey. I wore this jersey when I finished in the money in 12th place so I deced to wear the same last Sat. : ) Basically I was at break even chips when they broke up my first table. I played 1 hand (AJ) on the button with a min raise and the big blind called and we checked to the river and I won it with A high. The reason I remember this hand is because that's the only hand I played early other than the forced blinds : ) Basically I threw all of the dominated hands Ax and medium hands like KTs or QTs and even KQ and KJ even in late position. I remembered I folded AQ in early position because I felt there was a raise to come and sure enough a guy went all in with JJ and won that. Anyways.the way I won was basically only playing level 1 hands and playing them with an all-in raise. In the 6 hours that I played, I got 2 pocket Aces, 2 pocket Kings, 3 or 4 Big Slicks, and that's about it... I won all the show downs with the 5 or 6 all ins that I initiated so I did get great cards that day which helped. I also got a great straight draw on the river late in the tournament with an A2s vs AQ to keep me alive. My 2 mistakes of the tournament were : 1) limping in on the button with QTs and getting an All-in raise by the most aggressive guy in the tournament to my left which I promptly folded 1/3 of my chips - stupid move - from now on I will not play a hand that I am not ready to go all in with. 2) the last play of the tournament in which I was on the big blind with a Q2 with 9500 chips left after the big blind of 4000. No raise from the little blind (2nd most aggressive of the final 4 but a very skillfull player which I learned after this trap). This guy would go all-in at any sign of weakness just like the guy to my left. After the flop of Qxx I check with my weak kicker to the river which produced a 2 for my 2 pair. Now I looked at the board and saw a possible strait for him if he had the J... He made a great bet of 4000 and said ""i bet the minimum"" and trapped me. I didn't think he had the J so I went all in and knew I was in trouble when he immediately called me as I was reaching for my chips. If I folded then I believe I would have made it to 3rd or more as the blind would put the other player all in. All in all it was a great tournament and I learned alot and will try to repeat soon. I think the key is to wait for the level 1 cards to play and play them strong and hopefully they will hold up. The best hand of the tournament for me was getting AA on the big blind and having a mid position player go all in with KK ! I won that matchup as well as AK vs AJ which got me enough chips to make it to the money. I'm estimating that 3000-5000 chips should be enough for you to sit on to make it to the money.""  "

( urlLink http://www.derbylane.com  727-812-3339.  Everyweek this tournament sells out at the open because they allow you to pre-register Friday starting at noon.  Most players purchase their seat the day before.  If you show up Saturday without a seat ticket, make sure you be at the Plaza door at 11:00am and get in line before they open the door at 11:30am.  As soon as you get in, run straight to the escalator, not the elevator on the right (much slower), and take a right and then a left to the next escalator.  Then go thru the glass doors and go to the left and get in line in front of the counter in front of the poker room.  Since 3 weeks ago, this tournament has sold out every Saturday.  The 1st place prize is $2,000.  I know a player who finished 4th a few weeks ago and it paid $650.  I finished 12th once and it paid $137.  "

Bad beat #1 : Jeff C.'s pocket queens vs. John's pocket aces - All In Action - Jeff gets a queen on the flop to take out John. Bad beat #2 : Casey had AK and the flop gave him trip kings... Casey then goes all in and was called by Bobbie who had a pocket pair... Bobbie hits trips and takes Casey out with a full house.  "

I'm only taking twelve units because of a SNAFU with the counseling department has greatly restricted my eligibility for classes. Of course my waiting to sign up for any classes until the day before the cutoff for Fall semester registration had absolutely nothing to do with it. At least my schedule for this semester has some fun and easy classes. Other than college stuff, I haven't been doing much of anything eventful. I am going to do some writing on my old Underwood typewriter (my graduation present from my mom, it is absolutely the coolest writing instrument ever devised). I'll probably start upon a new short story. Should be fun. My 18th continues to close in. September 5th seems to be just around the corner. Well... that's about it for today. Almost forgot, the Giants have won five in a row and hold the lead in the NL wild card race. "

2958,4162840,"07,August,2004",2004-08-07,"   Giants actually won today. Schmidt picked up the win (14-4) and (I almost can't believe I'm writing this) the bullpen didn't implode in a shitstorm of Biblical porportions. J.T.'s red hot, smoked a three run dinger to crush any hope the Cubs might have had. Hermanson definitely going to make a good closer.  We should be moving into the new house soon (Glory Hallelluyah), almost definitely by my birthday. I'm actually going to have a real room!!!  I badly need to develop some semblance of a social life. I will surely lose what teetering facade of sanity I have now if the status quo remains.  Just burned a new CD. Has ""Paint it Black"", ""Wanted Dead Or Alive"", and ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" on it and ""Hotel California"" is the closer. Should be a good one to listen to at night.  Plan on maybe getting some knuckleballing in tomorrow, happy-happy-joy-joy.  50 some-odd days until ""The Dark Tower"" is released. Am happy, but also sad. Roland and the rest of the ka-tet are the closest friends I have right now. God that's pathetic.  Would commit genocide in a small Third World country right now if it meant I would get a girlfriend. Given the previous ""D.T."" statement, prospects seem incredibly dim. Wish I had my Chris Isaak CD on me right now, ""Kings Of The Highway"" and ""Wicked Game"" make me feel less crushingly depressed. Don't know how listening to sad music while feeling sad helps the situation, but it does, somehow. "

4524,4163223,"09,August,2004",2004-08-09,"   For all those action movie fans, Vin Diesel symbolises the ideal action hero. He's got lot of attitude, muscles and style. ;-) This was the second time I was watching this movie. Riddick (Vin Diesel) is a most-wanted fugitive, being searched by a number of planetary systems. He is being hunted all the time by mercs (mercenaries) who are looking for a prize. While saving his own ass, and kicking asses of such mercs he ends up at the planetary system of Helion Prime.  Where he meets one of the Elementals (those who calculate future using probability, we havent got such people right now I think, but the concept is not bad) , who make him realize that part of him which he has forgotten. That he is a survivor of planet Furia, that he is a Furian.  Helion Prime in the meanwhile is under the threat of attack from the Necromancers (a breed of people led by the Lord Marshal, how is half human and half something-that-nobody-knows-what-he-is). Their motto is ""You keep what you kill !"", a very bold faith which leads to some interesting dialogue scenes in the movie.  In the events that follow we see a lot of great action sequences especially the ones on the triple security prison on planet Crematoria. The movie proceeds in a good speed, great special effects and amazing scenes. It is a must watch for all sci-fi action movie fans.  PS : The theatre we visited was Plaza. It is a no go ! Pathetic screen, pathetic sound, pathetic movie print. But if u have no other choice, I suggest take the cheapest tickets at least you will be nearer to the screen to listen to the sound.  "
4525,4163223,"08,August,2004",2004-08-08,"   Had the opportunity of watching this amazingly disconnected oddball of a movie yesterday. Mujh se shaadi karogi another attempt of mash-mixing hit hollywood flicks by David Dhawan.  Anger Management, Meet The Parents, Matrix  the movie draws from all of these  foren  films. The movie is basically a comedy masala movie. ( lots of oomph ! like the  kanta laga  girl playing the role of  Bijli  and doing an item number) .  David Dhawan is banking on making money by attracting  desi  audiences by showing some  maal . Having  Baywatch  attire through out the movie. (Though I give credit to the movie for having a great collection of songs).  I spent half the time waiting the movie to finish.  Sallu baba and Akshay kumar spend most the time showing off their muscles. And for a change Akshay kumar is the saving grace ! The guy did a good role in Khakhi too, I guess he gives a good performance whenever he is cast in a multi starrer, so for the want of competition he ends up raising the level of his show.  I should say this as a final verdict, like my friend Makkhi says : ""Dimag mat lagao !"". A thing easily said but tough to do, when u have nothing else for 3 hours to do.  PS : Those new to Bglore from Delhi, the theatre was NAGA in Ulsoor. I suggest dont go for the front row, its out right discrimination they have actually put chains between the front stall and others so you have to come out of the hall to goto refreshments ! Besides the chairs in front stall are hard wood ! Talk about difference between a 30rs. ticket and a 50rs. one.  "
4526,4163223,"08,August,2004",2004-08-08,"   After graduation from college you look for a job, in my case I landed up in Bangalore (25th July 2004 - for the record), ending up to work for off shored IT division of a US company.

Banks, companies, malls, theaters, Dominos, Pizza Corner, stolen goods market, smuggled goods market, Baristas, Cafe Coffee Days, book shops, video game parlors and of course a lot of indian population - a good big package of things compressed on to a long road. (no doubt roads are lifelines of a country)    The weather in Bglore is much like that in Europe, only the traffic is much more and lot more indisciplined. The first Saturday night I ended up buying a Tag Heuer watch.... a cheap imitation of course ;-). Bglore is a young city with fast life and a hubbabub of multicultural torrents mingling with each other. Its like a young teenager trying to look cool too fast, living life in the fast lane but only his style is cramped the lack of space and bad roads. In every other corner u would find a tech company, each one trying to become a behemoth - a collective effort though disconnected that might turn Bglore into a spank new version of Silicon Valley, outside the US of A.

I can remember when I went as a kid, it was huge and exciting and I wanted to do everything and there was never enough time.  Now that I'm a little older, I am wondering what was so exciting.  But we still had  a great time.  Ken and I rode the Batman and the Superman.  Two very high tech rides than what we were ever used to.   I guess those old rickedy roller coasters were the fad of our times, but nothing compared to the Batman.  It was the best I have been on.  The Superman was okay but it was to short and not enough twists and turns for me.   It was great to walk through the amusement park with Ken.  We had a lot of fun.  Kimberly brought her friend Ashly and they went off to have their own fun.   It's funny, it has been a 1-1/2 that I have been living with Ken and his family.  I don't feel any different than the first time I met him, other than closer and absolutely comfortable.  I can tell Ken anything.  He's my bestfriend and still till today, he looks at me and I still melt.  I guess that is because we continue to work on our relationship, remember being friends is important and to accept the ups and downs.  But to pay attention to those moments and recognize them.  Don't discard them, rather handle them at the moments time and not dwell on them.   Tomorrow I will have to work on our computers.  Yes, we have a virus in the systems.  So, I guess that means for the next few days I'll have to back everything up, reformat the drives and get us up and going again.  Ken has a class this weekend to attend for the firearms training and we are planning a huge bar b que for everyone attending.  I, of course, will be cooking on the grill, some ribs and make a few salads.  I enjoy people so very much and love to entertain.  We have a local range we belong to and truly enjoy being with others with the same hobbies in firearms and competitions.   Well, it has been a long day and I think I am going to turn in.  Until I write again.  Peace  "
31084,4168492,"07,August,2004",2004-08-07,"   I suppose I am getting a little sleepy.  I thought I would go to bed but I couldn't stop messing around with the formatting of this new blog.  I have had a cold for the last few days and have slept in for most of the day today.  I'm tired but I'm not sure if I can actually get to sleep.  I will try.   We are going to Six Flags tomorrow.  It should be fun.  My fiance`, Ken, who you'll hear about from time to time in my postings is taking me along with his daughter and her friend.  I haven't been there for over 10 years.  I'm sure the rides have changed.  I love rides.   Well, I suppose I had better tuck myself in to bed.  Until I write again.  Peace  "
31085,4168492,"07,August,2004",2004-08-07,"   I suppose we all need an outlet. Why not write. I am an artist who's time has come and gone and has come and went and who sees and sees again. Of course, none of this mumbo jumbo may make any sense to anyone other than me, but that is fine. I'm not writing for the world other than my own artistic expressional outlet. Andy Warhol said it best in that we are all famous for at least 15 minutes once in our lives or ""They say that time changes things, but you actually have to change them yourself"". My life is ever changing. I suppose by writing I can keep up with it. I enjoy painting and drawing. The artist inside of me, no matter what my career is, no matter what my social status is, no matter what face I paint on, the one thing I am certain is that I am an artist. Funny, I once had someone write to me and tell me that they are able to tell what mood I was in while I was working on my art. I am an artists who's emotions goes in to her work. I'm very easily read.  Until another time I write.  Peace"

29552,4168699,"07,August,2004",2004-08-07,"    ""Yarghhh"" yelled Stramboli against the gushing waves of the Topeka River. ""Get a frickin branch or something Stewie"", ""I'm about to drown."" ""I'm working on it Stram, I'm working!"" shouted Stewie to his friend in peril. Stramboli and Stewie had been friends for about 10 years now, and knew eachother like the backs of their palms. They were both 15 years old and lived life very nonchalantly. They lived in a mountanious area surrouned by mountains of coure and many trees and waterfalls. Everyday they would go out into the mountains exploring, and today Stramboli happened to fall into the river. The current was strongly pulling him towards the 20 story high death trap, the Topeka Waterfall! ""You dunce!"" screamed Stewie ""how the hell did you manage to fall into the frickin river?!"" Stewie threw a long branch at Stramboli as he was yelling. Stramboli grabbed on and pulled himself up to shore sputtering out mangled phrases. ""Gahgbag I'm ok."" Stramboli was very flustered and needed to lay down for awhile before speaking again. But before he could do so, something started flopping around in Stramboli's pants. ""My God"" muttered Stewie. Stramboli reached into his pants and pulled out a whopping big fish. ""Looks like I caught myself dinner!"" yellped Stramboli in utter disbelief. The boys decided to start on home sharing their story about the river adventure with eachother, each time adding another part that was not mentioned before. As they were walking, the boys ran into a freakin huge bear! The boys both screamed ""Jee Wilikers"", and ran for their lives.   "
11551,4170329,"19,August,2004",2004-08-19,"   sooooo, i was at my apartment and randomly frank knocked on the door and said that i had to go with him because we were meeting crissi, jose, jake, mandy, carrie etc etc. at this pond/swamp/river/lake thing. so i jumped up and got ready and ran 14 miles with frank to the pond place. we had to climb through some bushes, buildings and rooftops to get to the ""special"" pond. when we arrived everyone was swimming with alligators, crocodiles, worms, fish, tadpoles and etc. i was scared shitless but eventually i jumped in when jose said "" you're not down"" so i had to prove him wrong. everyone was having a grand time and the cool thing to do in this pond was try to get a worm to wrap aound your neck to be a necklace. i was the only one who succeeded at the task. all of a sudden, frank freaked out and said i had to go with him and we had to run back to his house for a minute. being the dumb girl i am, i said ""ok."" so we ran back to his house only to change his son's diaper. AAAAAAHHHHHHHH.. oh god!!!!!!! then he was freaking out about why he wasn't making any interest on his well fargo bank account since he was writing over 400 checks a month. what the fuck?!?!?! so needless to say, we went back to the pond and on the way we brought his son and frank asked me to be his baby's momma. i nearly died but said yes to him.       it was at this precise moment i woke up in a panic this morning. what the hell am i dreaming about. i make myself nervous.      in other news, my dad came this past weekend and took everything i own besides my t.v., computer, some clothes and some bathroom products. my apaprtment is bare. i am wuite nervous about moving home and will miss my independence in davis tremendously. i honestly think that i enjoyed my time in davis. it was rough in the beginning but it got easier with time. i am sooo fournatute to have parents like mine who supported and semi-paid for me to be here. i look forward to being closer to my friends in murrieta. and hope that the hotties come out where every they live and show their faces to me so i don't have to dream about resorting to be someone's baby momma.       i hope all goes well with my move back to so cal, it will be a big change for me and i just keep praying that my family will get better with time and my dad finds the strength to hold on each day. i love you all and hope you have a great day!!

29494,4170570,"10,August,2004",2004-08-10,"   Was driving home from work last night and as usual, tuned to my favourite radio station. A song by JJ Lim was played. Though I've heard that song before, i never took note of it. It was only yesterday, alone in the car, without any disturbance, that i listened to the lyrics. WOW! It was SO moving! My vision blurred when tears began to fill my eyes. The lyrics were short, simply written, yet touching."
29495,4170570,"08,August,2004",2004-08-08,"   Work hasn't been very smooth lately and i'm trying hard to improve the situation. Well, at least today had been a rather fulfilling day. Early in the afternoon, a couple came into our store. They recognised me, as i attended to them abt half yr ago. As for me, needing to meet different people everyday, i couldn't recall attending to them until i took the lady's record out, proving to me that i did attend to her last time. She commented, ""I'm so happy to see that you are here, because we like your service"". Then her partner asked me to help him adjust an item he bought from elsewhere some time ago, i just did as per normal. When he tried it on, he was saying, ""Wow! It definitely feels much more comfortable! You are indeed very good at it!"" ( nah, i dun think i'm good yet.. in fact, i'm still learning.. ) It really feels great to hear such nice comments from customers ( as such comments rarely come out from the mouth of locals ) and indeed a much needed morale booster."
29496,4170570,"08,August,2004",2004-08-08,"   Heard from my good friend yesterday, that he failed his driving test. Everything was smooth until somebody knocked his car while he was stationary, awaiting to turn. And he was faulted for that. I think it is really unfair to be penalised for a mistake that made by others while there was absolutely nothing the person could do to prevent it from happenning. He was just too suay to be at the wrong place at the wrong time. I could feel that he was extremely upset and dejected over the incident. Somehow, when i heard the news, it sort of affected me. Upon hearing the it, i felt very sad and sorry for him. Couldn't stop thinking how was he coping with the disappointment. I used to be nonchalant when things happen to my friends. But somehow or rather, i've been more emotional lately. Perhaps there is some changes in me after my breakup with my ex bf? Perhaps i'm beginning to realise the importance of friendship. Whatever it is, i hope my friend is feeling better now."
16905,4176051,"20,June,2004",2004-06-20,"   My teenaged daughter left today to spend the summer with relatives. Don't get me wrong, I love her dearly, but the last few months have been *challenging*, to say the least. I think we both need a break for a while, so I'm thankful that she has the opportunity to spend the summer away - and I'm sure she is too.  I hope she'll have a lot of fun.  That said, I've got more than enough to keep me busy while she's away. It's time to start whittling away at my ever-growing stash. After all, I need to make room for some new yarn, right? Today I start on my summer poncho, another origional from my favorite LYS. Well, maybe it's not quite an ""original"". I was in the shop chatting with some ladies there when a woman came in wearing a gorgeous mauve-colored poncho (a la Sex in the City). She wore it with blue jeans, a white tee and some very sexy-looking high-heeled slides.  She looked fabulous!  She had purchased it from a trendy shop in the city and was wondering if someone could help her figure out how to make another one for herself.  Of course, we all jumped at the chance to take a closer look, after asking her to take it off! :)  After trying 3 different yarns, 3 different stitches, and at least 3 different needle sizes, I've finally got the look I'd hoped for and plan to start knitting as soon as I finish blogging.  I'm using Maggi's Linen in a beautiful deep mustard color. It should be a quick knit. Since I intend to do nothing else today except knit, I should get quite a bit done.  "
16906,4176051,"14,June,2004",2004-06-14,"   Here it is, the one I've been waiting to wear... My Rumba sweater. The pattern is a Lettuce Knit original (my favorite LYS - local yarn shop). The yarn is called Rumba. This one was truly a labor of love. It's knit in all one piece and although the yarn is beautiful, it's not the easiest to work with. And don't drop a stitch because it's impossible to pick up! I was about 4"" from the end when I noticed that a join had come undone. I had to unravel the entire sweater and start again. That's the bad news... the good news is that I love this one so much that I'm going to make another one in black! This time I'm going to be knitting it along with my buddy Nim, who's going to be knitting my sweater's twin, so we'll have each other along for moral support.     urlLink  "

16908,4176051,"07,June,2004",2004-06-07,"   Here's sa picture of one of my prized possessions... handmade knitting needles from my husband, Jonathan. Most people would make needles from wooden dowels, but not my DH. He started with a plank of rosewood, which he cut into 2 ""strips"". Hours of sanding (by hand) later, those strips were transformed! Now I'm on a mission to find the perfect project with which to christen my new needles.    urlLink  "
16909,4176051,"07,June,2004",2004-06-07,"   I've tried journaling before, but never had much luck with it. Perhaps I was intimidated because I didn't believe I had anything profound to say. Or maybe I was afraid that someone would find my journal and read my most private thoughts. And many times, I just didn't *feel* like writing.  But this time it's different. I'm on an incredible journey and although my insights may not be profound, they are significant (at least to me) and I want to record them in some way... and since I type much faster than I write, this seems like the perfect way to do that.  At 45, I've finally found a passion in life, in a most unexpected format - knitting. It's become so much more than a pastime or a hobby. It's become a way of life. For me, knitting is relaxation, release from stress, meditation, prayer, functionality, creativity, philanthropy, gift-giving, and just plain fun! Through a variety of colors, textures and patterns, I create things that please my eyes, soothe my skin, and massage my ego - all at the same time.  It's about creating a vision and making it happen... it's about understanding that giving a gift can be as great a joy as receiving one... it's about practicing the principles of simble abundance... it's about realizing the awesom mystery of creating a piece of wearable art from a single piece of string.  I knit from my heart... I knit for my soul.  "
16910,4176051,"30,July,2004",2004-07-30,"   I thought that subject line would get your attention! ;)  Yes, you guessed it. I'm talking about that dreaded ""S"" word... Swatches! I understand the need for swatches to measure the stitch gauge before starting on a new project. But I'd always thought, and been led to believe by some pretty experienced knitters, that row gauge didn't matter. After all, you just keep going until the piece is as long as it needs to be.  Who care how many rows that is, right?  NOT!!!  I found a wonderful pattern with raglan sleeves that extend all the way to the neckline. Here's a picture.  Raglan V Sweater  urlLink     I did a swatch and the stitch gauge was fine. I did the front, back and all the way to the armhole shaping on both sleeves (knit at the same time), only to find that my sleeves were at the right length for my arms, but according to the pattern, I had many more rows to knit in order to get the correct number of increases.  Go figure!  (I wish I had).  Anyway, I've shared my dilemma with some of the ""old school"" knitters at my LYS and I'm going to take it with me to the next knit night and hope that they can help me figure out a way to save my project.  "
16911,4176051,"07,July,2004",2004-07-07,"   Today was a great day.  I finished the work I needed to do for the day at 10:00 and instead of going home and finding more work to do, I decided that this was going to be a mental health day. Of course, this meant going to my favority LYS to sit and knit.  I took a couple of projects, one of which just needed the dreaded finishing that I've been putting of for weeks. Not only did I get the cable shell finished, but I learned a beautiful finishing technique in the process.  Here's a photo...   cable shell  urlLink      I made some progress on the cable/lace shell also. I can't seem to bring myself to spend a lot of time on the linen summer poncho. I know it's going to look great when I finish it, but I'm just not ""feeling it"" right now. I'm about a third of the way done, so I've convinced myself that I'll have it done in time for cooler weather in the fall.  While at LYS, I met a new knitting buddy... It didn't take long for us to discover that we both have an adopted child, we are both expectant godmothers, and that we are both interested in starting knitting ministries at our respective churches. We took a short break for lunch, and then returned for an afternoon of knitting.  Now that's the life!  "
30463,4176133,"14,August,2004",2004-08-14,"   I think exersise is horribly undignified. Jews don't exercise, It uses up blood better left in the brain. My grandfather is a rare exception, he's a Jew who became rich from  the exercise of gay men (for the most part.) He recently sold his magazine company, which had begun to flag, and is slightly out of sorts. No wonder, he had started his bushiness from scatch and devoted his life to it, and now it's in the paws of some slimy yuppie.  I used to be fat until two years ago when I went to THE WORST FUCKING BOARDING SCHOOL ON EARTH. Bye bye trust fund. Up in lake placid, it was -30*F in the daytime for two solid weeks. We spent a fortune in long underwear.  The food was so shitty and it was so hard to stay warm the pounds melted. I became so thin (99 lbs. From 120) They declared me anorexic and kept ""an eye"" out on me, which meant I could not eat salad. Really.  I don't have strong self-destructive tendencies (like my then-pal, 13 year old R, who said she fucked men anytime she wanted to at home). The strangest thing I do is that sometimes I'll go outside (or in the house when I'm alone) and breath as fast and as deeply as I can unlil I almost or hypervenilate. I like the tingily sort of feel it gives me, and I'm sure it's harmless.  The art department sucked horribly as well. We had one, sporadic drawing class taught by this mannish woman who knew no one (except ME, dammit) had any interest in developing work, so she gave us beginner exercises out of a textbook. One of the kids could only draw stick figures, and he was so utter daunted one class he put his head on the table and cried. I nearly felt sorry for him, but he was such a little piss-pot I snickered with the rest of the class. It was a rare moment of solidarity among my classmates.   "
30464,4176133,"13,August,2004",2004-08-13,"   I haven't mentioned it, but I've spent the last two weeks up in provincetown with my mother, sibs and grandmother.  My sister is nine, my brother seven, and they each have their problems but we've gotten along much better since I decided to ignore them most  of the time.  My mom doesn't know about this blog, I don't want her to.  I don't think I care or even want anyone to read this blog.  If someone did, I'd love for them to send me an e-mail.  All my friends are fucking crazy and have almost no access to a computer. My best friend has begun a bike trip across California, to eventually end up in Mexico, where she knows no-one.  It's 9:40 as I write this, and our fragment of hurricane Charlie has still to run it's course. I read a charming article in the utne reader called either ""how blogs ruined my life"" or ""how my life is ruined by blogging,"" but it was very funny, and although I believe pre-2000 utne is superior to current issues, It's worth  reading and you can subscribe to utne through their website. I've begun to read The Extra Man, about a gentelmanly tranvestite in new york who rooms with an eccentric elderly escort.   "
30465,4176133,"09,August,2004",2004-08-09,"   There was nothing she detested so much in the climates and seasons as a fine summer afternoon, with its lazy languor, with the obscene, satiated luxuriance of its vegetation which seems to communicate itself both to animals and people. The dreadful act initiated by those muggy, voluptuous hours was that of lounging in a chaise longue with one's legs apart and one's arms raised, while yawning very loudly, as if obliged to expose one's genitals, armpits, and mouth to goodness knew what kind of rape. Against this triple yawn, Melanie cultivated the laugh and the sob, two reactions which implied refusal, distance, and the human being's withdrawal into itself. The weather best suited to this rejection syndrome was a luminous frost, which gave rise to a denuded, frozen, hardened, and brilliant character...  Like all children, she had encountered the mystery of death. But in her eyes it had immediately taken on two completely opposite aspects. The animal corpses she had seen were usually swollen and decomposed, and exuded sanious secretions. Such beings, reduced to their last extremities, crudely avowed their basically putrid nature. Whereas dead insects became lighter, spiritual, and spontaneously attained the pure, delicate eternity of mummies. And this did not only apply to insects for, ferreting around in the attic, Melanie had found a mouse and a little bird that were equally desiccated, purified, reduced to their own distinctive essence. This was a good death. -From Michel Tournier's The Fetishist, ""Death and the Maiden,"" lifted from ""slurping sounds.""

30467,4176133,"08,August,2004",2004-08-08,"   The birth of my blog! Can you smell the silicone? This blog will suckle gladly at the breast of the summer of my fifteenth year. Sigh. I suppose you middle-aged readers with you had your youthful exuberance and health to spend hours on a pathetic open journal. But this is the Hollywood of the diary! Who knows what young starlet will be discovered? Perhaps a talent agent, after hours spent shuffling through the millions of dull blogs that pollute the internet, to happen upon (not this one, I only post to spread the love)one sassy, sprite of as blog that has him on the very edge of his swivel seat. He must know who is the possessor on such a swift, witty tongue! You are discovered, and it's only a matter of time until you've got a sitcom and a book deal in the oven. Life is sweet!   "
26385,4179297,"13,August,2004",2004-08-13,"   I found out last night that I will be moving shifts at work.  This is depressing news,  as I adore the folks I work with now.  We get along so well and know how to work with each other.  Not trying to say too much in the negative about my reassignment, BUT....  Have you ever ran into people who just don't like anyone unless they're cute, drive a cool car, or have money oozing out their ears?  The ones who are so negative about most anything unless it involves something good for them?  That's this crew....well, with the exception of one.  Well, I'm cute (I think).  But I am a big woman, so that marks points against me where these folks are concerned.  My car is not cool at all.  (10 year old Toyota Tercel that has blue smoke to match the blue paint) And since I support myself and my disabled mother who lives with me, I don't exactly have money oozing out of my ears.   I'm trying to keep a positive attitude about the whole thing, though.  One of my current shift members who has more supervisory experience than I do told me to try to go into it with a clean mental slate and not to hold grudges about problems with those shift members in the past.   I believe that is certainly valuable advice.  A little difficult to do, but still good advice.  A few months back I had mentioned that I would make a shift change if needed to try to help alleviate some of the problems that come from that group.  I didn't really expect it to happen so soon!  So I suppose I will be hitting the bookstore today before work to find some books on personality types, management strategies, etc.   At least one thing went well yesterday!  The dentist appointment wasn't even half as bad as I expected it to be.  It took longer for the anesthetic to work its magic than it did to complete the procedure itself.  My appointment was at 2pm, and by 2:30 I was driving home!  Today my jaw is a bit sore at the injection site.  I guess that's a small price to pay for a tooth that is now more aesthetically pleasing, durable, and complete.  Oh yeah...Seems as if Tampa might get blown away before I get to my vacation.  I've been keeping up a little more than usual with the Weather Channel since Hurricane Charley is headed directly for my hotel room in Apollo Beach.  This is par for the course for my run of luck.  She certainly isn't a lady with me!  Off to Barnes and Noble to spend even more money on books I probably won't complete!  (Oh shit.  I just realized it's Friday, the 13th!) "
26386,4179297,"12,August,2004",2004-08-12,"   Ugh. I have a dentist's appointment this afternoon. They're going to fix a tooth that I chipped on a piece of fried okra, of all things. When I was there for my cleaning a couple of weeks ago, the good doctor mentioned that he could probably repair my chipped tooth without having to use anesthetic.  Yeah.  Wonder what brand of crack he started smoking?!  I mean, really! I'm certainly a chicken where the dentist is concerned, but not as bad as some. One of my friends gets his dentist to use nitrous for a routine cleaning. Hopefully things won't ever be that bad for me! Unfortunately I've been blessed with the curse of being completely honest. There I was in the dentist's chair whining, ""Oh, no! Please use the shots! I'm such a chicken, but I don't care to admit it! Please use some Novacaine!"" To make me feel like less of a moron, the dentist said that he, too, was a big ol' chicken. Hey, he gets points for at least trying to make me not feel like a dumbass!  Speaking of not getting shots at the dentist, there is an awesome book I finished not too long ago called   urlLink A Million Little Pieces .  This book is by far, one of the best I've read in a long time. It's a brutally honest and painful account of James Frey's stint in rehab. He's 23 and has been an alcoholic for ten years and has been huffing paint, snorting coke and smoking crack for three years. I don't want to talk too much about it because you can read reviews on the link. Trust me, it's well worth the time. (You'll understand the dentist reference not too far into it.)  Okay, I've procrastinated long enough. My work stuff is due this evening, so I'm going to get cracking on it before I get sleepy. "
26387,4179297,"09,August,2004",2004-08-09,"   After reading a few blogs over the years, and since my  urlLink best friend  recently started one, I decided it was time I get one, too.  Kudos to Kelly for her MANY ideas!  To let you know a bit about me, I am a 27 year-old single white female who lives in the Bible-thumping region of these here United States called  urlLink Chatsworth, Georgia .  It's a small town that is rather uneventful, but we are in between Chattanooga, TN (30 miles north) and Atlanta, GA (about 80 miles south).  Whenever there's a craving for ""city life,"" we usually head south.  For good shopping, we typically head north. (Even though TN sales tax is highway robbery at almost 10%!)  My mother, my dog (a beautiful Sheltie named Sierra), hamster (uh.....a brown one I call Woodrow), and I all share an apartment.  It's certainly cramped and frustrating most of the time, but it's home.  I have been looking for a house to buy for the last several months.  It seems like every time I get excited about one, something happens that I can't get it.  I either get outbid,  the house is cute outside but falling apart inside, or it's 35 miles from my work, etc.  I'm sure anyone who has bought a house before knows the frustration.  I have never been married and have no kids.  I don't want to be married, either.  I have seen too many strong, smart, ballsy, and wonderful women turned into a weak, emotionally unstable, and depressed shell of a human being all in the name of ""making a marriage work.""  I don't see how arguing 24/7 and hating the person you're supposed to be with forever is any better than being single!    I work as a supervisor in a local 911 center.  I've been there a little over three years, and have been a supervisor since February 2004.  We dispatch law enforcement, fire departments, ambulances, as well as take all 911 emergency calls as well as the majority of non-emergency calls. We handle about 115,000 calls for service each year, and that workload is divided amongst four shifts.  I work nights and LOVE my job.  It's wonderful because I'm making sure someone's day is going to be better because of the help I've sent them.   By definition, I am considered to be a BBW.  For those of you not familiar with the acronym, it means  big beautiful woman.   I am 5'8"" and proportioned, so I believe I carry it well.  I have  urlLink numerous freckles, fair skin, grey eyes, and short choppy blonde/brown highlighted hair .  Recently I have been trying to get a bit of a tan because I am going to  urlLink Tampa  in about two weeks.  It's slow getting super-pale freckled skin to tan.  Apparently I am going to be doomed to turning into a broiled lobster on the beach.....I don't think my tan will be ready by vacation time.  For those of you who keep up with astrology (if there are any), I am an Aries.  I am a true Arian except that I am nowhere near being considered an athlete.  Even if my body were in better shape, I still would suck at sports.  I could never do better than 160 on the golf course.  I had the prerequisite bicycle as a child, but as I got older and busier, that hobby just kinda went away.  On the Keirsey Temperament sorter, I score as an  urlLink ENFP . I like  urlLink good books ,  urlLink Academy Award-winning  and  urlLink nominated movies , cooking, good conversation, having nights out with friends, comedy clubs, concerts, plays, and any other typical-but-not-sports-related activities.  I have strong convictions when it comes to members of ethnic groups, alternate sexual lifestyles, and any other thing that would make a person ""not normal.""  I have very strong opinions on how the country is on a downward spiral since there is a Wal-Mart on every corner, (thereby putting small business out of business for a dollar) congress is trying to legislate morality, and how some folks think it's acceptable to try to throw  around ""Bible-based"" beliefs while hating people who are different from them.  Is it just me, or is that quite hypocritical?  Is hating people because they're different from you what Jesus would do? No, you say? Then take off that damned bracelet!!! A diatribe on that will follow in a later entry...I can't use up everything I like to fuss about in my first entry!  Golly geez, it's late....I've got to get some work stuff done.  Thanks for taking the time to read about me! I hope you'll be back for more later on! "
26749,4184069,"09,August,2004",2004-08-09,"   I've journaled extensively for some time. I've written about people I hate, people who get on my nerves, how much sex I'd like to be having, crazy dreams I've had, etc etc. This is one of the literary forms that I enjoy partaking in the most. Journaling, or ""blogging"" as it's now known, can be liberating. You can say all of the crazy shit on paper, that you couldn't say to whomever it was you may've been conversing or arguing with or even shagging (or gank banking as my best friend and I lovingly refer to it as).  As Tony Soprano said this past season to his psychiatrist, Dr. Melfi, sometimes spilling open is like taking a massive shit. You feel a sense of relief. You've gotten rid of a load, albeit the load is personal. You feel triumphant. Holding bac- (bowels or thoughts) - is like Tantalus Torture... it can be very uncomfortable, the more the pressure builds. Unloading one's thoughts is an intimate act as is deficating. You sit on the can, and you ponder, as you're unloading. What a great analogy! It's usually something you do by yourself. Journaling allows you to expend that feeling.... the anger, the lust, the happiness, the joy etc etc. You can fucking trash people without having to deal with the drama you'd be bothered with, if you were to curse someone to their face. I suppose what I'm trying ot say is that my mind works in stereo folks! I am the quintessial shit talker and most of the time it's justified. I'm direct and I'm honest, but I'm also guarded and leery. There are times I simply can't say what I'd like to say to people. I simply write it down and store it away. I think now that I am ready to make the web masses privy what goes on in my head. All of it is worthwhile and thought provoking. Some of it might be a little profane and perverse. My mind run 'round and 'round liek a colorful mobius strip... none of the geometrical shapes ever really making any sense, but it's good shit nevertheless!  Of course I will compose your basic run-of-the-mill thoughts about current events and popular culture.  Important thoughts such as why Paris Hilton's sensuous vapidness is so appealing and noteworthy opinions of the like.  Fasten your seatbelts. This voyage inside my head may be turbulent, but it will be funnier than hell! "
26750,4184069,"11,August,2004",2004-08-11,"   Today plans to be a very unproductive one here at work... I hope. In the meantime, what to do, what to do-o... Hey! I know! I'll blog!  Let me blog about how unpredictable and strange the male populace can be. Not all of them... but some of them. Enough to make me scratch my head in befuddlement.  Some dudes are guilty of the same codes of conduct they accuse some of us women of e.g., complaining, talking incessantly and whining incessantly. Guys within my age bracket (26-mid 30's) can make you feel like you're the only person in the world when you're with them. They whisper sweet nothings in your ear and confess their feelings right on the spot. Sometimes this might even occur on the first or second date. Meanwhile, you're sitting there the whole time think,    ""Ohmydog! Is he serious?? We don't even know each other this is moving waay to fast...""     Of course you don't voice your concerns aloud, you simply just sit there nodding and smiling politely, wondering if it was a bad idea to make out with this clown. They mistake your smile for mutual feelings, however, and shortly thereafter... all of a sudden, this is when the guy decides to pull the rug out from under you.  He  beats  you  to the punch and end abruptly puts an end to things ,  after a handful of trysts. He accuses  you  of developing ""big feelings"" notwithstanding the fact that he pursued you and is the one with the big feelings. He is the one who talked up all of this rhetorical bullshit about seeing alot of each other, while you sat across from him with a grimace/smile combo on your face, trying not to wretch over the prospect of seeing this annoying so-and-so on a consistent basis. I think some guys like to flatter themselves. They build themselves up and think some of us women are supposed to idolize them. We should be flattered that they've asked us out and treated us to a couple of drinks and some take-out. There is nothing wrong with a little ego-boost fellas, but give me a fuckin' break! Dudes are always shocked as shit when some of us girls don't go sniveling and crying for an explanation. They're speechless after having given this long-winded speech about how fast this is going, because you simply listen quietly, nod, and then say,    ""Okay. Well good luck with your endeavors.""     They stumble around    ""wha', huh... uhhh... oh okay...""    stunned by your indifference and your willingness to accept that this brief courtship has fizzled. I can't even begin to explain how many self-absorbed dickweeds my best friend and I have dealt with, who think they're the shit and we're completely and utterly in love with them after like 3 dates. They become insecure because they've laid all of their cards on the table only to not have the feelings reciprocated. They make up some fucking bullshit explanation making US look like the clingy ones. Contrary to popular MAN-belief, we are really relieved that it's over. We simply do not give a fucking shit, because you were annoying to begin with. Not all women are pathetic dames looking to settle. If all you wanted to do was screw or make-out, then cut the pretense, shut the fuck up, and let shit unfold naturally. This bullshit is precisely why I prefer to date an older gent. The conversation is a lot more interesting and flows consistently, he is more direct with what he wants and needs, we can agree or disagree and then we proceed to  agree  on a mutually convenient time and place to carry on our shenanigans... point, blank, period. Older men also tend to keep the incessant whining to a minimum and actually ask YOU about YOUR day, instead of launching into this whine-fest about how horribly his day went. He's aware of the fact that you aren't his mother. After string of horrible and annoying dates with our male peers, my best friend and I celebrate our single-ness even more. We are none too worse for wear inspite of and despite our experiences. Being in the company of some annoying bitch doesn't even hold a candle to just being alone, sometimes. It's not as bad as I fancied it to be actually. The fact that in another week we'll both be 27 and 26 respectively and are not in serious relationships yet or married doesn't bother us anymore. It's not a bad thing to want to find something concrete with someone later on in life, and to WAIT for this.  In summation, dudes who're insecure and self-absorbed... this tirade is directed towards you all. DO NOT FLATTER YOURSELVES WITH YOUR ENDLESS PRETEXTS AND CHILDRENS' GAMES! Some of us require MEN who actually talk to us about worthwhile things. Intellectual intercourse I call it. They resume the intellectual seduction by putting their hands in the right places without asking (as was explained in my favorite French film, ""Romance"" by a self-professed casanova who bedded 10,000 women by simply engaging them in intelligent discourse). We're caught up in the rapture of the valid things they have to say, and allow them  to go there , with their hands. It starts upstairs first... and continues downstairs... if you catch my drift. This is how to seduce an intelligent woman effectively. You can't expect us to yield to you by ""playing"" us because of your own anxieties and your half-assed attempts at seduction. "
26751,4184069,"18,August,2004",2004-08-18,"   Sooo... This past weekend has been a very productive and alcohol laden one. I celebrated my birthday this past Sunday, so by today's standards I am officially over-the-hill... at a whopping 27 years of age! Hell, MF'n yeah! Despite my old-ness, I must say I am stoked and can't wait to reach the 30 years mark. My best friend (whose birthday is three days after mine, making Wednesday her official day) came down from Somerville, Mass to help me bumrush this smallish New England city. We had a blast. Cat is 1 year younger than me so is more immature and weird by default (tee hee... personal dig, 'cause I know she'll read this). Anyway, so Cat came down late Saturday afternoon, and the immediate consumption of several libations began. ... well not immediate... well... lemme explain...  We didn't want to seem like raving alcoholics, itching to drink at jump, so we pretended to catch up (yeah right... I saw her like a month prior and we talk on the phone constantly), and I gave her a giftbag... complete with lipgloss, toiletries and a gift certificate (which came inside a nifty compact mirror)- all from Sephora. We pretended to be interested in watching DVDs-  Strangers With Candy season 2  and some perverted Japanese film called,  ""In the Realm of the Senses""  perveeeerted city! I loved it! Anyway, at around 8pm or so we headed down to Pastis, a French brasserie in town, to listen to some live jazz and to indulge in drink and grub. Cat ordered some pork dish that was supposedly so tender that it was supposed to melt in your mouth. A pork party on your tongue - Um... no thank you, please. I had some simple thin thread pasta tossed w/ some vegetables and olive oil. We ordered kir and red wine respectively.  Whilst we waited for our food, we scanned the room critiquing bad hair and attire. As the band,  The Edwin West Project  (a twosome which featured a singer (Edwin) and a guitar player) - was setting up, I couldn't help but notice how familiar the singer looked to me. I realized that I recognized him from two local record stores he worked at (first one and then the other, not at the same time). I couldn't wait to hear his gig. All set up and ready to sing, Edwin looked over and said during his intro, ""Hey I know you..."" which I found amusing. Every so often, we'd pass each other on the street and exchange cordial head nods of recognition, but we never introduced ourselves formally. Needless to say, he was great. He covered a lot of great jazz standards with a smattering of Bossa Nova thrown in...   The Girl from Ipanema  , for example. After Cat and I devoured our food and drink, I waited for Edwin to break before I went to the bathroom. Upon returning, I found him sitting in my spot chatting with Cat. I squeezed in next to Cat and then Edwin and I formally introduced ourselves to one another. The three of us chatted for the duration of his break about his singing endeavors and such. Afterward, Cat noted this bartender who I'll refer to as  'S'  she and I befriended about a month ago, from this place called Agave Grill. I wrote a favorable review of Agave, for a local magazine, after which Cat and I saturated our bloodstream with its high-end tequila and sangrita... Hey, it was all in the name of post-article research. I can't speak what I don't know... Anyway, Cat spied him and would later admit to me that she'd been thinking about him for some time after we familiarized ourselves with him during our tequila induced debauchery. hint-hint. She went over- (I'm sure she sauntered and swayed)- to say hello on her way to the ladies room. Sometime in-between then, we got a free chocolate birthday souffle with a side of lemon sherbert on a thin cookie and a  digestive  courtesy of the manager of Pastis. Oh yeah, we had coffee too. I would later discover that this digestive would be the culprit for a killer hangover the following Sunday. Anyway, we listened to Edwin sing a couple more songs, then S'... came over to say hello to me. He had another Agave staffer in tow. They enouraged us to meet them at this OTHER place called Peppercorn Gril further downtown, on Main Street. So, Cat and I polished off our digestives and made our way on down to Peppercorn Grill in the rain... pushing our way through a thick cloud of clubbers. Upon arriving, we found S' and the other young woman, (I'll call her 'G'), whose boyfriend is a bartender there. We told them that we'd walked and they practically gasped with shock. I guess walking is some antiquated notion nowadays. While chillin' at Peppercorn Grill, we all passed around some cucumber and melon martini that G's boyfriend had concocted. It was very good I must say. Afterward, we all headed down to this wine and panini bar called, Bin 228 where we had several more drinks. Meanwhile, sitting across from the two of them, I could feel the sexual energy emanating from Cat's and S's attraction to one another... so during one of my drunken, obnoxious semi-tirades, I began teasing the both of them. I mean, it was obvious to me that they were attracted to one another.  G and her boyfriend were also in the midst of some weird discussion, trying to determine whether they were a serious item or not. G would later turn to us and tell us that she and her boytoy had been fucking for about 7 weeks so she figures that constitutes ""dating."" hahahaha (sorry had to laugh at that one). See, G is from Ecuador, so ""dating"" is a weird term there. I guess they call it something else. In any event, during the course of the evening, I also learned from G. the origins of F.U.P.U.A. - an acronym for Fat Upper Pussy Area. Oookaaay. 'S' gave Cat and I a ride home (I live right down the street from Agave). Next morning, I woke up with a killer hangover, we went to brunch/lunch... at this diner called Mississippi Bar and Grill, I drank black coffee, ate my lunch with a side of Advil and then we walked down to a Tea/Coffee/Martini bar combo for some loose tea in a pot. Later we would head on over to my mother's house for more birthday food. Sooo it was a productive birthday weekend. Cat and I also made time to call my job's voicemail repeatedly during our drunken shenanigans to listen to one of my colleagues' weird cartoon voice. She offered up options on the voicemail's phone tree. Cat kept opined that she sounds like she should be saying, ""WELCOME to MOVIE PHONE!!"" Plus said co-worker is one of those people who says,  ""progrum""  instead of  program . hahahah, funny stuff. I must say, Cat and I always have a blast when we meet up, so it's not like I'm surprised by how much fun we both had. In summation, I learned this past weekend taught me that it is not appealing to have a F.U.P.U.A., I don't ever want to have a hangover again so I have to stock up on  Chaser  or   lay off the granddaddy liquor altogether, and that two people who're attracted to one another just need to be prodded on by a drunken third party.  cheers!

I was up at Mick Connelly's lake house after his son's Bar Mitzvah. We were all swimming and being happy and I was sad when she left and explaining is moot beyond this point. Best of friends but one's a little bester. 
6099,4184856,"10,August,2004",2004-08-10,   Just read a couple pages of a book I'd read before then felt blessedly tired but didn't go to sleep. I can never get to sleep these days. I recently had a dream where I would walk down this trail next to a boggy marshy little place to get to open bay water and climb onto the dock. I couldn't climb it though because of the nasty spiders hiding underneath. Pity. Also i remember something about a rich house. A large house...maybe. I forget. All of you shut your mouths and fetch me the...go fetch. 
6100,4184856,"09,August,2004",2004-08-09,   There's nothing worth telling! Why can't i just spin right back into the world of lies i'm used to. It's hard to be so boring. Oh Well. I'd better work on my story. 
6101,4184856,"09,August,2004",2004-08-09,"   I've recently written to Hollywood unknown Annelise Van Der Pol. Check it fools.  Anneliese, I am writing to say hello and to ask a favor of you. Iâ€™m not really a fan of â€˜Thatâ€™s So Ravenâ€ but, I do watch the show (if only occasionally and due to a couple of younger sisters in the house). I believe you to be one of the better actors on the show and find you quite attractive as well. Perhaps you should pursue some better acting roles. The show is great and very entertaining, but I would love very much to see you in something serious, something real. Youâ€™re very beautiful, and good at acting, from what I can see. I donâ€™t think finding roles would be a problem. Now, onto the reasoning as to why Iâ€™m really writing. Most of the mail you get is probably all asking for autographs and proclamations of love for the show. And though I would like an autograph, Iâ€™m requesting it, if you would, in a different manner than most. It may sound a tad bizarre, but stick with me. I would like a checkâ€¦for as little as you see fit, something like a quarter or a dime. It is an autograph, technically. However, you wonâ€™t find the amount taken out of your account, as it will simply by mounted and stuck on my wall. To me, the novelty of an autograph/check is insurmountably entertaining. In all probability, this letter with be ignored, as Iâ€™m sure it has been delivered stifled among hundreds of others. Youâ€™re also bound to have preparations for the show, etcetera. But if you do answer this letter, especially with the special sort of autograph I have requested, I will be sure that a kindness of that level does exist in the world, and will praise you for it. Thank you for simply taking some time out of your day and reading this, if nothing else. Much luck on your future endeavors, be they acting related or otherwise. Please and thank you in advance, and hereâ€™s hoping. With love,              Adrien Darcy, age fifteen of Upper Montclair, New Jersey.  P.S.I have noticed online that you charge a fee of $5.00 for an autographed photo. Seeing as this is a bit more elaborate, I have included a sum of $10 as a sort of deposit (should the check should fall into the wrong hands and be cashed) and for any personal inconvenience it will cost you.    Noticed i lied about my name....Well what would you have done? I can't have hollywood get wind of me.    I'm lonely. "
6102,4184856,"09,August,2004",2004-08-09,   Bon soir mes ami. I've found that living a lie is far more fun than surviving in the world you're provided with. TALKING about such a world...well it just turns my stomach. But I'll do it. And you are going to be here to watch. 
13485,4185342,"19,August,2004",2004-08-19,"   My laundry machine kept flooding my bathroom, and when Ben took a look, he said that when my bathtub was replaced and the machine got moved around, the exhaust hose was put in the wrong hole, but that a piece had been removed so it would fit and I would need a new hose.  I mentioned this to my supervisor (who had done the fixing) and he insisted on coming to my home to look.  I told him it was okay, but I have a feeling that he and Mastui, who tagged along, were eager to get away from the office for a bit during the day.  It was pretty funny to see them both trying to figure out how to fix my little washing machine, with one tilting it and the other, kakhis rolled above the ankles, sqatting below to see what was happening.    They told me to put in some laundry as a test run.  I did that, and when they decided it was working, they said that it was time to go back to the office.  Of course, this was mid-laundry cycle.  I did my best to waylay them (I gave them tea and chocolate), but there was no way I could stay and wait until the end of the cycle.  My clean clothes were doomed to wrinkles and mildew.  I asked Matsui if he had ever done laundry before, and he said he had, but informed me that really, you don't wash your own clothes, the machine does it for you.  (Ba-dum ching.)  A note on Matsui: Matsui, to me, is hilarious.  I told him that I didn't have much experience cooking but that I planned to make stir fry (and had to explain what that was) his response was, ""Oh, wow, you really can't cook, can you!""  He then proceded to guide me to some leeks, saying that they were better than scallions because they were the same thing but bigger.  (I assumed he was right, until I ate it and recognized the flavor - it did not taste good in the stir fry.)  He also thought I bought too much garlic, even though I explained that it doesn't really go bad and that I planned to use it pretty much every time I cooked.  He's married, and I have heard from the usual (unreliable) sources that he's probably never done any housework in his life.  "
13486,4185342,"17,August,2004",2004-08-17,"   I've been printing out the New York Times' ""Metropolitan Diary"" on a weekly basis in hopes of presenting some of the blurbs to my English Conversation group one day.   This is from the August 18th Metropolitan Diary:   Dear Diary:  One recent afternoon, I was waiting in line at the silver counter at Tiffany. A woman ahead of me had just purchased a bracelet and was filling out a gift card. She looked up and asked the salesclerk, ""How do you spell 'bar mitzvah'?"" The salesclerk didn't hear her. I intervened. ""Bar mitzvah?"" I asked.  She smiled and nodded. ""Didn't you buy a bracelet?"" I asked.  ""Why, yes I did,"" she answered.  ""So it's for a girl?"" ""That's correct,"" she said. I explained: ""Well, bar mitzvah is for a boy. Bas mitzvah is for a girl. So you should say 'Happy bas mitzvah.' "" She thanked me, then I asked, ""Do you know if they are Sephardic or Ashkenazic?"" Her face dropped. ""Oh my, I have no idea. Does it matter?"" she asked. I replied: ""No, not for the purpose of a gift. But if they are Ashkenazic, it's bas mitzvah, Sephardic is bat mitzvah."" ""So how do I spell it?"" she asked. I told her. She smiled and said: ""I'm visiting from Milwaukee. Thank you for all this information, it's so interesting."" She looked a bit sheepish and said, ""I don't know any of this; I'm a Catholic."" I said, ""So am I."" Surprised, she asked, ""My goodness, how do you know all this information?"" I responded matter-of-factly, ""I live here.""   -Brian Honan   I've often tried to explain this phenomenon to non-New Yorkers, and sometimes to Japanese people, who seem to only half believe me.  Ironically, though, it has relevance here.  My predecessor, Ben, was Jewish, and in his monthly column in the town newsletter, he often introduced Jewish holidays and customs.  Many people in the town smile enthusiastically when I mention the now familiar words ""Rosh Hashannah"" or ""Hannukah.""  Even funnier, though, is that Ben and I are both living in Shitara, we figure that out of 5,000 people, we in Shitara might very well have the highest concentration of Jews in Japan.  "
13487,4185342,"15,August,2004",2004-08-15,"   I was dying for some basil, but there was none to be had, either fresh or dried.  I decided that, despite its being the end of the summer, I would plant some.    At the first store I went to looking for seeds (they had dirt and planters out front), there were no seeds, but a friendly old obaasan (granny) who introduced me to her daughter, who was a modern artist with an upcoming exhibition in Nagoya.  She showed me her work, and she told me how her daughter lived in London, so we were able to speak some English.  Who woulda thunk that there was a house full of award-winning abstract art down the street from me?  Basil was a bust, but at least I got a dose of culture.  I gave up on basil for the day, and went to meet my friend (and predecessor) Ben.  When I met him, he was having a conversation with a very petite obaasan who was talking a mile a minute.  I introduced myself, and she bantered on without the usual pauses to make sure that my foreign mind was absorbing it all.  She went on about how it was really too expensive to bring presents all of her friends in nursing homes, or even to get to the ones in Hokkaido, but that now was the O-bon holiday, and all the dead relatives were going to come in to visit tonight anyway.  Then, very abruptly, she started talking about how foreigners eat a lot of meat, but it makes them tall.  ""And, I watch those movies where the foreigners kiss, and it's so wonderful!  The foreigners definitely have us Japanese beat in the kissing department!""  That is exactly what she said.   Back to the great basil hunt - yesterday morning, Ozzie neighbor Hamish and I walked through the entire downtown, but not even a suggestion of basil seeds.  Finally we were walking past a florist near my work, and Hamish pointed to the plants lined up outside.  ""These are all basil!  Why plant when you can get a fresh pot!""  I walked into the unmanned, darkened store.  The inside seemed to be some sort of stationary store.  ""Hello!  Excuse me?""    Finally, a middle aged woman appeared from the back.  I told her I wanted to buy one of her basil plants.  She looked shocked, then laughed, ""Oh, those aren't for sale.  But I can give you one.""    I tried to refuse, but she picked out a plant that had BOTH basil and the Japanese green, shiso.  I was rather embarrassed, but now I have my own, very much alive and fresh, basil plant.  "

Not totally sure about this blog thing, but hey, I'm still waking up at 5 am every day, so might as well be productive... I'm living in a small town in a region I'd though no one had ever heard of, but apparently it was made famous by a photographer named Shinzo Maeda.  Most of the ""town"" is literally in the mountains - houses along windy roads with no guard rails, terraced rice fields and tea and veggie farms - you name it.  Absolutely gorgeous.  When I first got here, I was staying in the home of one of the town's muck-a-mucks. Now, I live in low-income housing in the downtown.  Downtown is called ""Taguchi,"" and the danchi (apartment building or complex) is called Yage Danchi. I'd better get ready for work.  I finally, after almost a week, have my very own shower.  More pictures (and explanaing) to come!  "

25617,4186455,"15,August,2004",2004-08-15,"   Later that day I got to thinking about relationships. There are those that open you up to something new and exotic, those that are old and familiar, those that bring up lots of questions, those that bring you somewhere unexpected, those that bring you far from where you started, and those that bring you back. But the most exciting, challenging and significant relationship of all is the one you have with yourself. And if you can find someone to love the you you love, well, that's just fabulous. - Carrie Bradshaw  "

I'm still letting myself get weak and giving in to Trevor, though, and Fred called me on it. It just seems easier to let him have his way sometimes, you know? Gotta be strong, Brooke, gotta be strong.       You know what? Family is a beautiful thing. It truly is. If you don't spend time with your family, you are missing out. They have wonderful stories to tell! I helped my aunt move tonight, so I got some quality time in with her and my grandma. I love them so much. My grandma told me about the days when she used to go to TWU, back when they were VERY strict (ever see Mona Lisa Smile? JUST like that! strict curfews, no guys on campus, dresses all the time, etc.). And then my aunt (she's 31) told me about when SHE went to TWU, and you could wear pjs to class and it was co-ed (not that many guys go there), and the guidelines weren't nearly as strict.. it was so interesting! Of course, now I'm exhausted because of all the labor from moving, but it was worth it.

7576,4189257,"12,August,2004",2004-08-12,"   This is a very short story I wrote a couple years ago and just recently edited again.  Thought people might like to read it.  ***  So then what happens is: There's nothing. And I mean nothing. Tending bar Friday nights at Belluci's across the way from the college; trying to get the Honda started in the wind chill; watching the Leafs lose to Jersey on TSN.  I said to Bellucci, not that there was anything in it for me, but I said to Bellucci something like: ""Why don't you change the name of this broke-dick place and get some college kids in here to drink beer? Get some music in the box instead of this Kim Mitchell trash. Put a pinball machine or something in the corner. Show something pay-per-view for Chrisakes! They got thirty thousand kids across the street looking for a pitcher of Becks and a Radiohead record and you got this third string Anne Murray knockoff in the corner with a fingers-on-the-chalkboard voice.""  So then, when Bellucci hears enough, he goes: ""Take a hike,"" which means get gone fast and don't come back. When you know Bellucci three minutes, you know how to read between the lines.  ""Pack it in your kazoo,"" is my reply as I unhook my poncho from the nub and hit the door. With Bellucci, it's safer to read insults from long distance, or refrain altogether. Big as he is, you can't tell where the fat leaves off and the muscles begin.  ""I'm leavin',"" I said as I stopped by the open door.  He turned. His face fell slack. His jaw dropped and his mouth sunk open in mock surprise. ""T'row a party for yourself.""  That was the last time I saw him - until later when I had to ask him for my job back.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Weinrhoder got rich somehow, trading fat-backs and rat-tails on the commodity exchange. He'd buy them when nobody wanted them and sell the rights when the scarcity set in. He sits around the bar a lot and sucks on limes that I float for him in a glass of gin. He says this is the only country in the world where you can get on a train and leave town without checking in with the authorities. ""It's still possible to become a millionaire here,"" he says, ""as long as you don't file any taxes."" He bores the shit out of me really, except that I figure if a dumbass like him can make it, there's still some hope for me.  Zeidel is a weight lifter for Barbell City, down three blocks. He'll show you how to ride the stationary bicycle and how to row on the rowing machine. They pay him for this with a cardboard, computerized check from the home office, which I take from him on Friday nights and turn it into about twenty bottles of Lite beer from Miller, and then I give him the change. He told me how, although he is Jewish himself, he questions the Jew. ""Too much emphasis on the affairs of the mind,"" he says, ""to the neglect of the body. A healthy body and a healthy mind are one and the same. To neglect the body is to squander a valuable inheritance. Kill the body and you kill the head.""  He told me the only thing he hates more than a phony intellectual is an underdeveloped pair of biceps or a man who didn't know where his next meal was coming from.  ""Damn right,"" I told him, pretending to be listening. ""I think you touched on something there."" He tries to be friendly but on Friday nights, I started wearing long-sleeved shirts.  ""What some of these stick-necked intellectuals need is a good beating,"" he said to me one night. I'm not an intellectual but when I'm working behind the bar, and everybody gets really drunko, I could be mistaken for one, and I'm truly on the cusp of being a stick-neck, so now I hang down the other end of the bar when he comes in, visiting only when he bangs his empties on the hardwood.  Craven owns the copy-shop across the street. ""I'm sick of dealing with the public,"" he says. ""I'm sick of all the mealy-mouthed mutts who want something for nothing. One day I'll set a match to the whole frieken' thing. I don't care if the whole goddamned block burns down.""  Loughlin drives one of those beverage trucks. One night when Rev. Jesse Jackson comes on TV, Loughlin takes his hi-ball glass and heaves it at the screen and cracks the goddamned thing. Everybody ducks like it was a bullet until they realize it's just Loughlin again. ""I hate that sonofabitch,"" he says. ""Don't worry, I'll pay for the damages.""  Mr. Gwynne is a banker. Branch manager. Steps in, has a few. Brings in a girl friend from the bank now and then because everbody in here could care less. Told me his wife goes to Colorado in the winter and Miami in the summer because she loves the intensity of the seasons. I used to give him the odd short beer like on the house, when Bellucci was gone of course. We talked politics: Pine Ridge, El Salvador, third world debt relief, the usual BS. I'd Soften him up, let him sound important. Then I bang on him for a loan. All I wanted was half decent car, not a loft in Yorkville.  ""You think I could get me a car loan?"" I ask him. ""I can get it anywhere, but I figure, you're a customer, I'll throw you the business.""  ""Oh, no, no,"" he says. ""I don't handle that stuff, I don't do anything under half a million, and even then, only to corporations, business loans.""  I told him, ""Loan me half a million, I'll give you back four hundred ninety-five right there at the table."" I only need a used shit-box that starts up in the winter.  ""Wish I could, my boy,"" he says. ""It's just not my department.""  Later, I see him downtown one day, squeezing his fat ass out of an twelve-year-old Chevvie and I realize he's broker than I am. From then on, he pays for his own drinks and I give him the cold shoulder. One Friday night when Zeidel is good and drunked-up, I'll whisper in his ear that that guy Gwynne down the end of the bar thinks you're a fag.  Stephen floats in on weekends to listen to the fingers-on-the-chalkboard voice. He's into interior design and I think he's got his eye on Freddie the piano player. Stephen wears those tight slacks and a Byron short, close at the waist, and billowy in the sleeve. One Friday he asks me if I want to go on a Sunday picnic with him in his restored MG. I told Bellucci: ""Get rid of these gayblades or pretty soon they'll be dancing naked on the bar. And that includes Freddie.""  Bellucci says Freddie is an artist and he comes cheap. Stephen drinks Marguerites and pays cash. ""Besides, he's a fashion designer, that don't make him a queer.""  ""Maybe,"" I tell him, ""he'll write this place up in Better Bars and Gardens.""  Bellucci teaches some sort of real estate course two nights a week at some community centre up the road. He snuck in there through somebody he knows when nobody was looking. I guess it proves he does have that degree from Seneca like he says, but it forebodes bad times for his students. If the kids' parents ever for a look at Bellucci's expertise in real estate, they'd send their punks into the army for training, like in the old days.  I can only imagine this pile of mashed potatoes teaching somebody about floating mortgages, prime rates, equity-income ratios, etcetera, when he not only doesn't own a piece of real estate himself after forty-six years on the earth, but is even four months behind in his rent on the bar, and (he brags about this part) he hasn't filed a tax return since '76. So much for higher education.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  So Bellucci takes off for Florida in February like every other bar-owner in the world. He goes down there to Lauderdale with his Bermuda shorts and thirty pairs of mid-calve socks, the shoes on his feet, three pairs of underwear, one blue Izod shirt, one green Izod shirt, one ""Bellucci's Bar and Lounge"" tee shirt and a green, plastic-peak half-hat with a band around the back.  He meets the other bar owners from New York, Boston, and Philadelphia and they bounce around the cocktail lounges with their shorts and their socks and their brown shoes. They throw around tips like a gang of Babe Ruths. The biggest tipper in the world was not John D. Rockefeller, he was a bar-owner with a load on. When he's up and around and sober, he won't give you the fuzz off a tennis ball, but put a shot of Jack Daniels in front of him with a beer chaser and he'll donate his liver and eyeballs to science. He'll leave a day's pay on the bar on the way to the next joint. Don't ask me why, that's just the way it is. It's tradition and the ginmill jockey who thinks he can do it differently is either new at the job or he will soon find himself a new occupation. It becomes clear to everybody that he doesn't belong.  Anyway, Bellucci does the wings of man and here I am, Undersecretary for Barroom Affairs, left in charge. Face the Nation. Shit-face the nation. The Honda's fuel pump is shot, and the exhaust system finally rotted its way into Japanese heaven. It's parked up at Yonge and Finch with a flat left rear. I think it has finally lost its will to live. It shows no interest and fails to recognize me. The headlights and grill are covered with frozen mud and somebody snapped off the aerial. One windshield wiper is in the up position, the other is gone altogether. Bleak city is the ditty. At this point, a smart guy realizes that bad as it is, it could be worse. You never know when there might be a new Terror Alert.  So, while Bellucci is gone, I devise a little merchandising ploy to put the place on the map. The method I'm not prepared to reveal because I'm truthfully thinking of taking this concept public and franchising it again and again around the world. International. Five days didn't go by from its inception to the point where there were lines of people literally out into the street trying to get in. Even the regulars, Weinrhoder, Zeidel, Craven, they can't get in anymore. It's too packed.  When Bellucci comes back from sun city, he can't believe his Italian eyeballs. He shoulders his way in, bull that he is, by bogarting his way past the people in front of the line. He muscles his way to the bar and ends up with his head between these two cougers who do Amaretto and are here almost constantly since about two days after my innovation, my master-stroke. Donald Trump would probably like to talk to me about this.  Bellucci, with his arms around these two old babes, leans up real close to the bar where he can get my attention. His eyes are wide and white, his nostrils flaring with excitement.  ""Kid,"" he hollers, ""this is incredible. There must be two hundred people crammed in here and another two hundred and fifty outside tryin' to get in. It's a zoo. I love it!""  ""Go home,"" I tell him, loudly. ""Give me one more week and I'll have this place floating. I haven't even started with my marketing. This place will be more famous than the Lido. 426-5050? Don't make me lose my chain of thought.""  ""No, no,"" he hollers. ""You do it. You do it, kid.""  ""I can't have nobody bothering me,"" I tell him. ""You go home. Come back in a week.""  ""Right,"" he says. ""Right, I'm goin'."" He looks square at the two women, one to the other. He's got a grin on his face like the cat who swallowed the canary.  ""Are you ladies enjoying yourselves?"" he shouts.  ""Oh, yes,"" says one. ""We adore this place.""  ""Great, great,"" squeals Bellucci. ""I love it.""  People are clamoring up and down the bar for drinks. Others are fighting their way from ten deep to get to the mahogany. ""This is the owner,"" I say to the ladies.  ""How nice,"" says one, the smaller one with glasses. ""We're here all the time, every chance we get. Your bartender is a wonderful young man.""  ""The best,"" screams Bellucci. ""The best!"" He's smiling like a whale, his lower jaw open, his bottom teeth exposed, his tonsils dancing like Astaire and Rogers.  ""We've been coming here for over a week,"" says the gray-haired, fatter one. ""And he hasn't charged us for a drink yet.""  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  So then what happens is: There's nothing. And I mean nothing. I said to Bellucci, not that there was anything in it for me, but I said to Bellucci something like: ""Get bent."" This is after he fires me. I told him too, don't think I'm going to do the Billy Martin thing where you hire me back and forth every time you get in a jam. Once I leave, that's it.""  ""Take a royal hike,"" say Bellucci. ""I'll put my size 11 so far up your ass, the inside of your head will smell like leather.""  That's the way he feels about it. Enough said. Some guys are afraid to spend a little money in the interest of promoting their business. Johnson's Floor Wax spends about twenty million a year getting their name in front of the public. Bellucci's brain curdles at the thought of a few shots that don't immediately translate into coin of the realm. That is why Johnson's are waxing the shit out of the western world and Bellucci is all out of roach spray.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Three days into the off-season and Zeidel and Loughlin catch up to me. ""Let's go,"" they say. ""We're takin' you out for a few pops.""  ""Oh, what's the use,"" I say. ""Everything falls apart. That's the way it goes. It's entropy. It's Einstein. It's the quantum factor.""  ""Your ass is the quantum factor,"" says Zeidel. ""All of a sudden you're a smart guy?""  ""Hell no,"" says I, lying. ""It's just that everything I got is broke, including me.""  ""Hey,"" says Loughlin, ""you're with us, you don't go to your pocket. There's people waiting for us.""  Before you know it, we're across from the college and I'm being dragged into Bellucci's. Craven is there in the corner. With Weinrhoder. And Gwynne. The big tub of whaleshit, the owner himself, is there, sitting at the same table, the wrong way on a chair with his eggplant forearms crossed over the top. He's lecturing them like he's John Kenneth Galbraith.  ""Here he is,"" says Weinrhoder.  ""Bring him over here,"" says Craven.  ""Sit him in the chair,"" goes Bellucci.  ""We thought we was a friend of yours,"" says Zeidel from behind, where he's got his claws dug into my trapezoids.  ""You are,"" I say.  ""You ran out on us,"" says Gwynne. ""I told you I can't give you a loan. It's the bank, it's not me.""  ""I didn't run out on nobody,"" I say. ""I was three feet in front of a size 11. That's not running out. That's self preservation!""  ""So what are you gonna do?"" asks Loughlin.  ""Live in my car. Lose a lot of weight. Get my goddamned MBA and get done with it. Don't worry about me. Two years and I'm on Bay Street.""  ""Bay Street, your ass,"" says Zeidel.  ""It's like this,"" says Craven. ""Mr. Bellucci and us, we got an understanding. You don't work here, we don't drink here. And that's not Woody Allen talking. Who's talking is five right-down-to-the-wire alcoholics. Mr. Bellucci here, he sees you in a new light. He wants to give you your job back. Like a manager's assistant while you go to school.""  I look at Bellucci square-on. ""That right, fat-man?""  He hesitates five seconds to get his Italian temper back in the box. His eyes open up wide and he starts to chew on his tongue. ""I'd like to have you back, kid. It's not that these guys spend a few hundred a week in here, neither. You got good ideas; you just get carried away a little. Just ask me before you do something crazy next time. By the way, if you do get to Bay Street, try calling the boss a fat man, see if he's as nice as me.""  ""You guys are all right,"" I say. ""It's nice to be wanted.""  And it is. Yeah, it can hold you back from a lot of things you should be doing, but when you add up all the columns, what the hell else is there in this short, narrow little life that makes a lot more sense than that? What?  "
7577,4189257,"11,August,2004",2004-08-11,"   Let me establish two points of information before I tell this story. First you should know that for the summer of 2004 I have a gig as a glorified janitor at an wealthy suburban Church. You know the kind - with either mint green or fushia upholstery and accents. This gives me a unique persective on North American Evangelicalism because I get to see what rich Christians consider garbage.  Secondly, I am desperately in love with Sacramental Theology. Basically that means I like my Christianity soaked and dripping with liturgy, ritual, sybolism and tradition. Because of this, I have a very high view of the significance of the Eucharist (Communion as we usually call it to avoid sounding too Catholic). While I know the casual manner in which these acts are treated by many evangelical churches is for the most part harmless and well intentioned, we've gotten out of control when people begin to detest communion because it means they have to stay an extra 15 minutes in the service on Sunday morning and that the roast might go dry or they'll miss their Tee-time. I do my best not to be critical (at least not mean spirited) and to derive as much meaning as I can from the way we do Communion, while supplementing with the occasional trip to placate myself when the need arises. Of course, sadly, I can't participate in the Catholic Eucharist, but just seeing other people do it is usually enough to satisfy me.  These things established, imagine my horror when I walked in to change the garbage bins in the Church on Monday morning after a Communion Sunday. Trays and trays full of unused stoned wheat thins - the crackers broken for the sins of the world - the body of Christ, given for you - just dumped in the trash. I'll admit I crossed myself and considered doing my duty in line with Canonical practice by eating the reserve, but there were just too many.  I tell this story with a bit of tongue in cheek. I know the Zwinglian theology behind it and that the Alliance Church comes by it innocently. I don't think Jesus will be too mad about it in the long run. But, shouldn't it give us pause to rethink what we are doing when we participate in the Lord's Supper? We don't all have to believe in transubstantiation, but shouldn't there be a middle ground somewhere? Surely, if anything, this one act should be given some special consideration and not just put on the same level as the extra bulletins we printed being run through the paper shredder. Christ gave us the Sacrament of his body and blood for a reason. It is special. It is a source of connection to the grace of God that we don't recieve by other means. If it isn't, why do we do it? Just because Jesus said we have to? I hope our love of Christ is bigger than that.  Just some good natured thoughts - not a Temple clearing.     Peace be with you.  "
7578,4189257,"10,August,2004",2004-08-10,"   While the event you are about to hear described took place several weeks ago now, rest assured it is definately blog worthy. It has most of the unbelievable elements of the opening scene of a cheesy porn movie, and yet took place in the real life of a mild mannered budding theologian on his way home from Church.  I was riding home on the subway after a night of work at Bayview Glen Alliance Church in North Toronto. As is frequently the case, I was making use of the 20 minutes of travel time by reading a good book. On this occasion it was the venerable German Jesuit Herr Karl Rahner, PhD DPhil. As my eyes scanned a section dealing with transcendental revelation, my ears were perked by a female voice in the seat next to me saying ""are you going out tonight?"". I looked up to see that this girl, rather attractive in her early 20s with a slight accent, was accompanied by two others of similar description. Thinking they must be speaking to someone else, I glanced back down at my page. Again the voice, but this time ""hey.. we're just trying to be nice.. people in Toronto are so rude"". She's talking to me? ""Oh um.. sorry.. I didn't realize you were talking to me.. no, i'm going home.. I just finished work"". One of the companions, the one on the left, chimed in for the first time, ""where do you live?"". ""Downtown.. near the UofT"" I answered. This time it was the companion on the right's turn, ""do you go there?"". ""I do, yes"". Back to the first girl in the middle again, ""what do you study"". At this point I'm beginning to feel like I'm being interviewed for something, and I rarely perform well in interviews. Also, I often dread the question ""what do you study"" because when my answer is ""theology"" it usually means a very awkward few minutes of conversation ahead of me. This occasion was no different - in fact, it will no doubt go on record as the most memorable and uncomfortable of all. A few questions go back and forth and it turns out that these three young ladies are Catholic girls from Montreal. They ""have their beliefs"" but ""don't follow them that closely"". It becomes Obvious that the extent of their understanding of what it means to study theology consists of ""so you don't get to have sex"". I tell them I'm not going to be a priest so I am allowed, but it really is too late - these girls have something to play with now and they decide to run with it. ""So, are you a virgin?"" they ask. I know, I'm supposed to be ashamed of it but I answered them truthfully anyway, ""yes, I am"". The ladies are in full stride now, making a game of it - lets get the little virgin priest boy hot under the collar. As if it wasn't bad enough, their next question puts it over the top. ""Are you gay?"". My answer is a fairly confident ""no"", but they persist. ""Well, if you've never f*cked a girl, how do you know you're not gay?"". I attempt to mumble out something about sexual orientation being defined by more than the act of intercourse, but I wasn't in top debating form at the time due to the fact that my jaw was still on the floor. Then, the coup de gras, ""we have condoms with us... and we're headed to a party at this hotel on Yonge and Bloor... you should come join us"". Fortunately, on this occasion at least, I have a pretty low self esteem. This allows me to assume that there was no way these girls are serious and that they are just doing this to mess with me and amuse themselves so I manage to turn down their proposition relatively cool and unshaken.  I spent the final two stops before my destination trying to pretend to read my theology text while the girls whispered that I probably thought they were the devil. I don't know who they were, but they're still ""on the loose"" - with all puns intended - so keep your wits about you boys.  "
7579,4189257,"10,August,2004",2004-08-10,"   On the advice of a couple good friends who have already embarked on the Blog enterprise, I have decided to jump into the fray. I remember the first time I heard of the idea of Blogging a year or so ago on some late afternoon 'get net savvy' type TV show, my first thought was ""now all those pseudo-intellectual type guys who are wannabe writers will go around saying they're material has been published as a way to pick up girls"". Now while i've never had much luck enticing the ladies with anything I do or say, I certainly am a pseudo-intellectual, so I guess I at least half fit the bill.  I study God for a living. (I know, I know, I can't believe they pay people to do that shit either but its true). Thus, many of my postings will probably be of an ecclesial nature: Either friendly ranting against my semi-FUNdamentalist Christian upbringing, or smitten remarks about post Vatican II Roman Catholicism. I used to fancy myself as one who had his ear to the ground on politics, art, music, and literature so there may be some of that too from time to time. And, I bleed the copper and blue of the Edmonton Oilers so I will rise and fall with them like the tides of my life (hockey and Christianity are intimately connected... ask me about it sometime). But, for my first entry, I thought it would be appropriate to recall a few things about the two aforementioned friends who inspired me to do this: Jeff C. M.D., and Sir Robbie J.  Jeff is my second longest serving friend. Our parents knew each other when the two of us were but toddlers. His Father is a gynocologist, his mother a benevolant dictator. While Jeff has 4 other siblings, I myself am an only child. They say only children develop fraternal bonds with one or two close friends. I would say Jeff is one of these. Although we've been geographically quite far apart now for 7-8 years, and neither of us are very good at keeping in touch, we always pick right up where we left off. In the future I will call on him to perform my coronary bipass surgery or blast away my kidney stones. In return, I don't know, maybe I'll baptize his kids into the One Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church. It all evens out, and we will always remain friends.  Robbie I have known I believe since the end of the 7th grade. I remeber playing lunchtime pickup basketball against him on the outside courts at Hillcrest Jr. High (home of the Mustangs), and we were both the biggest guys on our teams. I don't think I ever told him this but it was Pastor Paul Silcock who suggested Robbie and I become friends because we wanted to get him to come out to the Beulah Youth Group (damn Christians and their prostelytizing!). In spite of this, we did end up getting along very well and would go on to spend many an afternoon in Robbie's basement playing Super Nintendo, messing with the mind of our computer teacher Mr. Campsall, interacting with our special ed. friends EJ, Roy, and Keith, and trying to avoid being yelled at to get our ""heads out of our asses"" by our Football coach Mr. Belmont. I've always appreciated Robbie's adventerous side, his diversity of tastes, his ability to work hard, and his very evident concern for others.  So, thank you gents, and I'll see you in the days to come.  "

16748,4198810,"12,August,2004",2004-08-12,"   Ah, Friday.....that lovely day has yet again come along, and the week's drawing to a close. As always, my mind's not quite here at the office with the rest of me, as witnessed by the fact that I'm blogging when I really should be finishing work on that file thats been sitting on my desk all morning.  Got to the office and got an sms from a dear colleague of mine, H. Horror of horrors, dufus is at it again. This time, in his sick little mind, he's decided that he, as head of department, can stake a claim to crediting himself for our work. We've been involved in this major telecommunications deal for ages....H has been doing a bulk of the work and dufus came in far too late to be involved in any significant part in the project. Besides, with his kinda intellect, even if he did start it off from the beginning, its unlikely he would have contributed much anyhow. Think 1st generation ATARI PC and you'll get the general idea where dufus' intellect lies. If he were reborn with his current brain, he'd likely be an amoeba............  In any case, it transpires that H managed to take a peek at dufus' CV and guess what? He's claiming he ""lead the team"" that drafted those landmark agreements! Can you beat that? What the heck does he mean by ""lead the team""??? The only thing this man could lead is a horse drawn carriage.....with him as the horse! And even then, with hi puny little physique, I doubt he'd get very far.......  You know, I really, really, really wish I could somehow rig his chair with some form of microwave generating device that would cook him to a crisp in under 5 minutes at a push of a button.  In any case, he's a nutter that deserves to be given the boot, but alas, its not the Firm's style to kick out unwanted baggage.......  If theres a bright side to all this is the fact that I have 2 clear days to forget about the numbskull.  Ah...the weekends..ain't it a lovely concept? You know, whomever thought that it'd bea  good idea to have 5 days of work and 2 days of rest needs a slap on the behind. Why couldnt it be the other way around? 5 days rest, 2 days work...now THAT would be just SMASHING!  Its odd though - you look forward to the weekend with anticipation akin to a guy waiting for his bride-to-be to say ""yes"" to his proposal, and yet, when it does eventually swing by, you just wanna do NOTHING!  I have this friend, lets call him Mr. A. He kinda illustrates what I mean. All weekend, the boy doesnt even make it out his door! He sleeps, eats, goes back to bed, watches a bit of TV, eats again, sleeps, then wakes up the next day on Sunday to repeat this insane cycle of perpetual laziness. OK....so maybe not everyone shares my enthusiasm for doing stuff and filling my weekend schedule with stuff you want to do rather than stuff you HAVE to do to get paid, but seriously, how can ANYONE do NOTHING thru the weekend?  To be fair to Mr. A though, he's recently broken away from his inane weekend schedule. He's gotten involved with someone, you see, and when a guy starts to date, well, his life kinda changes. Now his weekend is something like this:- Sleep with girlfriend, eat with girlfriend, go back to sleep with girlfriend, watch a little TV with girlfriend, go back to sleep with girlfriend.....you get the general idea........  I thought I knew this bloke well enough, but since he got involved, he's become this little tyke - like my nephew - the kinda kid you feel like smacking hard with a thick hardback book cos he never listens and always has smart-ass remarks and excuses to throw back at you  when you wanna give him good advise.  Mr. A used to be known as the noble, loyal, trusted friend - a pessimist, but nonetheless, the kinda guy you'd go out of your way to help out if he ever needed it cos he's always been nice to you and has never, in the history of my college year, pissed anyone off. And thats bloody rare in my college cos EVERYONE pisses of everyone else once or twice a year - its almost tradition!  But now A has taken on this arrogant air about himself. Guess scoring a gal after 10 years of dating no one except Susie Palmer and her 5 sisters changes even the most humble of people.  This is a man who can't drive, didnt get a driver's license until he was 31 yrs old, refuses to take delivery of a car he ordered cos he's having last minute regrets about taking a car that won't take 7 people at a go (he forgets cars here can only legally carry 5), has boobs bigger than some women I know and comes to the gym in his pyjamas (I kid you not!)......its hard to pity a man who has all these characteristics and then adds a large dose of new-found arrogance to the soup.  This weekend his girlfriend has booted him out of the apartment cos her mother is visiting. Call me insane, but if I dated someone who did that to me, I'd take offence to it. She doesnt even want him to meet the mother, if you can imagine that. So after a week's worth of being sarcastic with the regular guys he hangs out with, me inclusive, and rubbing in the fact that he has a girl who he needs to kep company 24/7, he's decided he needs our company this weekend. I say Phooey.......dunno about the rest of the gang, but I don't see myself as standby company for someone to hook up with when one's girl refuses to let you see her parents......  "
16749,4198810,"11,August,2004",2004-08-11,"   Ever wonder why people aspire to owning german automobiles? Its odd, isnt it? These cars - BMW's. Mercedes-Benz' and Audi's - all do pretty much the same thing your good ol' Toyota does....except its double, if not triple the price.  This train of thought left the station cos a friend of mine just splurged 150 big ones on a 15 year old Mercedes! Why? I honestly don't know. Prestige, they say....the satisfaction of driving something engineered by the same people who almost took over the western world.....  Thing is, for that kinda money, there are a heck of a lot of brand new cars at his disposal. But he didnt want Japanese. Didnt want British either.......DEFINITELY didn't want local....OK...after having a brand new Proton act up on me the day I took delivery of the blasted car, I can perfectly understand the last write off, but Japanese?  I like JapMobiles. They're usually cheap (though anything above 90k can hardly be called cheap in my eyes), cheerful and go on forever and ever an ever as long as you stick to their service intervals. They're very well oiled machines, and that perhaps is their ultimate failing, as strange as it seems.  This is my theory......when you take something for granted - that the car will start first time, everytime, and will get you from A to B in absolute comfort and minimum of fuss, you tend to forget the machine that makes that possible. Drive any modern Japanese car and you'll understand. They're so utterly efficient that they are deviod of any characteristic that endears you to them.  Wanna test this theory? Drive a Toyota Corolla fo 30 mins. Then hop into a Honda Civic for 30 mins....then hop into a Mazda 323. They drive the same, feel almost the same and in many ways, look almost the same unless you have a keen eye for detail required to tell them apart.  On the other hand, ""continentals"" as we've come to term them, are utterly unreliable, expensive to maintain, temperamental, fuel guzzlers and often have baffling interiors. Their equipment can equally be as baffling as the cars themselves. Whomever thought it was a good idea to put HEATED mirrors in a tropical - spec Citroen Xantia really, ought to be shot......Same goes for cars from Mercedes.....what kind of ""luxury"" car makes do with vinyl seats? They call it ""MB-Tex""....fancy name for ""taxi seats"", really......  Fact is though, these quirks make us remember these cars. They leak oil, guzzle petrol, have air conditioning that doesnt condition air at all....but these are things we love. It gives the car ""character"", as car enthusiasts tell me.  And of course, living in a typically asian society, a person's worth is measured directly by his posessions, and having a ""continental"" car parked in your porch can sometimes mean the difference between being accepted by your future in-laws and getting the boot out the door by the very same people......drive a Mercedes, no matter how old, you're brilliant son-in-law material...the type mothers would pay you to marry their daughters. Drive anything Japanese and you're ""trying to make it"".......perfectly acceptable, but you'll always be subject to the ""upgrading anytime soon"" questions and looks......  For me, though, if I had 150k, I'd be bloody happy with a Honda CR-V in Zircon Blue Metallic...........;) To hell with what others think. They don't like what I drive they can catch a cab - likely fitted with ""MB-Tex"" upholstery too - LOL!  "
16750,4198810,"11,August,2004",2004-08-11,"   Ain't it odd whenever you get up, its a thursday, and you wish it wasn't? If I were born as a day in the week, I'd really hate being Thursday.....or Monday for that matter. Thursday's always that pesky little day you have to get over to arrive at Friday, which is when the REAL party starts.  Honestly, I don't even know why we bother showing up for work on Fridays. No one gets anything done on Fridays, for the simple fact that our minds get into warp 9 from the word go and zooms right into the weekend leaving our bodies to go mouldy sitting down in the office.  Assessment day is over, thank goodness! One thing I've learnt from last night's assessment video.....NEVER, EVER watch yourself on playback when you record yourself. Its perhaps odd, but although I stand a pretty tall 6ft 3.5in, I've never seen the world as a small place where a person my size would dwarf anything. I mean, I used to drive a Kancil, for crying out loud, and I felt the car was perfectly fine. If you don't know what a Kancil is, well, picture a one-seater lawn mower with a roof and air-conditioning and you'd not be far off ;) But seriously, looking at myself on playback, the bike, itself a solid cast metal contraption standing at least 3 feet tall and weighing a good solid 75kilo's, looked like a kid's tricycle beneath me!  I was really touched though.....some members of my class who normally didn't attend my Wednesday classes took time off to head down to class just to give support to their gargantuan instructor for the night. Some of them I actually thought of as complete asses till last night.  Theres this one guy, Mr. X, who annoys me as much as flies do when you're trying to have lunch. The type thats loud, brash and smells oddly like durian even if you're 6ft away from him . If you wonder what Durians are, its a fruit revered here in Malaysia as the ""Kind of Fruits"", though a friend once put it quite aptly into descriptive words as ""the best textured pudding eaten in a very badly kept toilet"". He wasnt very far off, truth be told.  But anyway, Mr. X actually took time off work, drove halfway across town and fought KL's infamous gridlock to get to class to show his support, though I thought his whole ""thumbs up"" action at the end of the assessment in front of the video cam was a bit OTT....;) But that kinda made me realise one thing - people you want to write off for the smallest faults often can surprise you in the biggest of ways.....  The opposite, of course, can be true as well, that of people you hold in high regard only to realise that they are complete asses.  Take one example - my Head of Dept.....popularly known as ""Dufus"" in my office. We had such high hopes for this man when he was hired to take charge of our department. That illusion however, was quickly shattered when he started snoring at his cubicle within the first week at work. I kid you not. The man had, somehow, somewhere, mastered the art of sleeping in vertical alignment on his office chair without keeling over. Thing is, if he limited that whole act to the office, it'd not be a problem, really....I mean, maybe the man has an over-active sex life (though if you looked at him you'd never believe it - he's best described as looking like a confused guppy at feeding time) and can't catch a wink of sleep at home, but noooo......the man has to fall asleep even when we're at meetings with clients! Its awfully humiliating to justify to clients why your boss is snoring during a meeting with the top management staff of the company present. Amused, they're certainly not. Neither are we......  In any case, getting back on track, we expected a whole lot from this man, who once owned his own firm prior to joining us here at the Firm (I capitalise this name, cos its very much like the movie namesake....once you sign up, you've sold your soul to the Devil). Let's just say that we were mildly dissapointed. OK...maybe not mildly. This is a man who claims that software can be patented, for crying out loud! In the US, maybe....but any first year law grad could tell you thats BS.....I think our clients realised that too....but despite our constant protestations to our senior partner about the state of stupidity that our head of dept is obviously a permanent resident of, he remains in the Firm.....and constantly makes life a living hell for all of us in the department.  If there's a bright side to all this, is the fact that we don't really see him much these days in the office. Marketing. What a convenient term for ""I'm sleeping in late/going out for an extended lunch with friends"". He often disappears for days on end, but really, I'm not one to complain. The less I see of dufus, the happier my life is in the office.......  Gloomy day again in KL.....haze is back and so is my sore throat....the day's only beginning. My body is here in the office, but my mind is really in bed, saturday morning, curled up in cold sheets kept icy cool by an air conditioner set at maximum chill....ahhh....now THATS life!  "

Got e-mails from old college friends, as I always do at this time of the day....seems everyone is either married, with kids or dating....suddenly I feel so bloody old!  Its a funny thing, being single. You love it because of the freedom it gives you. I mean, think about it - you can be as disgusting as you wanna be, hang out with whomever you wanna hang out with and do whatever, whenever without somebody howling down the phone line threatening to rip your CD collection apart if you're not with him/her within the next 20 minutes.  But on the flipside, you realise your friends whom you hang out with aint gonna be single forever, unless you do everything within your human powers to keep them single. Thoughts of telling gals that my best buddy is gay or telling your best friend the girl he's dating is a pshycho stalker chick may come in handy, if thats the game you wanna play....  But no, thats not for me....A lot of blokes I know get involved cos its ""natural"". When asked why they are dating, they just tell me that its the ""natural course of a man's life..."". I disagree.....afterall - whats ""natural"" anyway? Who decides whats ""natural""? Your mom?  I know my mom would kill to see me with a gal right now. I've been single for ages, and truth be told, I can't imagine myself dating anytime soon - just too much I wanna do with my life right now. Its like when you go on a short dream vacation - you pack only whats really necessary - and right now, a relationship for me is about as useful as a tank top on a skiing trip to Norway.  You know....that Carrie character in Sex & the City may be on to something afterall.......  "

Well, at least since January, when some silly obsession posessed me to take on training for RPM....a programme that I was so obsessed about I would throw fits if I missed class!

Hate self videos - what they say about cameras adding 10 lbs is a lie - it adds a good 20!) and submit the danged thing to the guys down under (no, not basement level of the gym, but the wonderful land of the Koalas and Kangaroos).....

On hindsight, maybe I should've just taken the day off.....my body is here in my cubicle, but my mind is elsewhere.............  Watched this silly marathon run of sex & the city last night on cable.......Honestly, its my first time watching the series and I already have issues about those 4 women.  Carrie is the one I really wanna hit her over the head with that book she constantly seems to be working on. I mean, c'mon......whats her hang up about letting her friends have their own fun? She seems single mindedly bent on making their lives centred around her. This one episode was hilarious - she was trying to get the rest of them to join her and Samantha in Atlantic city for a ""girl's night out"".....when the other two didnt wanna go cos they had LIVES to lead, she did everything in her power to get them to go.....I dunno bout you guys, but theres something seriously loony about a woman sho doesnt understand the concept behind the saying ""..get your own life, for crying out loud!""  And dont even get me started on Samantha....I mean, seriously, what the heck is the woman's problem with men and jewellery? She has this obsession with this Richard character...obviously rich, and she's obviously loving it not for the person.....I mean, have you seen the man? If he was a jar of jam, he'd be well past his sell-by date (but then again, Samantha's seen better days too...). Anyways, still, the woman is so insecure about herself that she runs 11 floors up the hotel emergency stairway in a pearl thong just cos she's insanely suspicious that her man is sleeping with the room keeping lady.....if samantha was a friend of mine, I'd do anything in my powers to get her admitted for a psychiatric evaluation.......Carrie too, if I have space in the trunk of my car......;)  Just cant wait for the movie ""Brokeback Mountain"" to swing by. An Ang Lee production, its an odd storyline to have Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllendhall (not sure of the bloke's last name - some names are just un-spell-able) star as .....if you can believe this one....gay cowboys.....  I think Hollywood has run out of ways to make the whole gay angle for movies interesting. Nowadays, you can barely watch a sitcom without either some gay inferences being made or an outright gay character being portrayed as Samantha with pecs.....Its sad to see Hollywood perpetuate the old-fashioned stereotype of the gay man. Lets hope Ang Lee's movie breaks away form that mould......  "

9040,4201404,"13,August,2004",2004-08-13,"   Behind The Scenes Of The Iraq War   The plan for the Iraq war, which has erupted in the face of opposition from the entire world, was drawn up at least decades ago, by Israeli strategists   In its attempt to realize its strategy of destabilizing or dividing the Middle Eastern Arab states, Israel has Egypt, Syria, Iran and Saudi Arabia on its list of subsequent targets.   As these lines are being written, the United States of America has begun striking at Iraq. Despite the fact that most countries of the world, and even the majority of the USA's allies, opposed it, the US administration was determined for the strike to go ahead. When we look behind the scenes of this insistence, it seems that Israel and its powerful lobby in the US, have the greatest share in the make-up.   In fact, Israel's policy aimed at the fragmentation of Iraq has lengthy historical roots-   The Age-Old Israeli Plan to Divide Iraq   An ambitious report entitled ""A Strategy for Israel in the 1980s,"" which appeared in the World Zionist Organization's periodical Kivunim in February 1982 disclosed a strategy aimed at making the whole of the Middle East a kind of ""living space"" for Israel. The report, drawn up by Oded Yinon, an Israeli journalist and formerly attached to the Foreign Ministry of Israel, set out the scenario of the ""division of Iraq"" in these terms:   Iraq, rich in oil on the one hand and internally torn on the other, is guaranteed as a candidate for Israel's targets. Its dissolution is even more important for us than that of Syria- Iraq is, once again, no different in essence from its neighbors, although its majority is Shi'ite and the ruling minority Sunni. Sixty-five percent of the population has no say in politics, in which an elite of 20 percent holds the power. In addition there is a large Kurdish minority in the north, and if it weren't for the strength of the ruling regime, the army and the oil revenues, Iraq's future state would be no different than that of Lebanon in the past- In Iraq, a division into provinces along ethnic/religious lines as in Syria during Ottoman times is possible. So, three (or more) states will exist around the three major cities: Basra, Baghdad and Mosul, and Shi'ite areas in the south will separate from the Sunni and Kurdish north. 1)   This was not the only announcement of the Israeli plan to atomize Middle East, including Iraq. As Israel Shahak, the notable Israeli scholar known for his dedication to a peaceful solution in the Middle East, explained that Yinon was just echoing the views of Israeli hawks:   The idea that all the Arab states should be broken down, by Israel, into small units, occurs again and again in Israeli strategic thinking. For example, Ze'ev Schiff, the military correspondent of Ha'aretz (and probably the most knowledgeable in Israel, on this topic) writes about the ""best"" that can happen for Israeli interests in Iraq: ""The dissolution of Iraq into a Shi'ite state, a Sunni state and the separation of the Kurdish part"" (Ha'aretz 6/2/1982). Actually, this aspect of the plan is very old. 2)   Thus, the plan was a serious one and this has been confirmed by the age-old Israeli support to non-Arab or non-Muslim minorities in the Muslim Arab states. The rebellious Kurds of northern Iraq was one of these strategic allies of Israel. During their revolt against the Baghdad regime, 1961-75, they have been financially and militarily supported by Israel. Israelis would love to see them carve up the northern part of Iraq, no matter how bloody and devastating such a civil war would be. However, the revolt failed in 1975, after loosing the support of its major patron, the Shah.   Fifteen years later, a new opportunity arose for Israel, an opportunity from the ambitions of the Iraqi dictator, Saddam Hussein.   Israel's Role in the Gulf War   Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein, after his bloody war against Iran in the 80's, invaded Kuwait in a sudden attack on August 1, 1990, giving rise to an international crisis. Israel headed the list of those forces that encouraged that crisis. Israel was the fiercest supporter of the attitude adopted by the United States in the wake of the invasion of Kuwait. The Israelis even regarded the United States as moderate, and wanted a harsher policy. To such an extent in fact that the President of Israel Chaim Herzog recommended that the American use nuclear weapons. On the other hand, the Israeli lobby in the United States was working to bring about a wide-ranging attack on Iraq.   This whole situation encouraged the idea in the United States that the attack against Iraq under consideration was actually planned in Israel's interests. Pat Buchanan summarized this idea in the words ""There are only two groups that are beating the drums for war in the Middle East - the Israeli Defense Ministry and its amen corner in the United States.""   Israelis had also initiated a serious propaganda campaign on the issue. Since this campaign was largely waged in secret, Mossad also entered the equation. Rogue Mossad agent Victor Ostrovsky provides important information on this subject. According to Ostrovsky, Israel had wanted to wage war with the United States against Saddam long before the Gulf crisis. So much so in fact, that Israel began to implement the plan immediately after the Iran-Iraq war. Ostrovsky reports that Mossad's Psychological Warfare department (LAP - LohAma Psychologist) set about an effective pro-war campaign using misinformation techniques. 3)   A Mossad Agent Describes the Gulf War   Ostrovsky describes how Mossad used agents or sympathizers in various parts of the world in this campaign. Among the tools employed in the campaign were the horrible massacres done by missiles launched against civilian targets in Iran during the Iran-Iraq war. As Ostrovsky makes clear, Mossad's later use of these missiles as a propaganda tool was quite peculiar, since those missiles had actually been directed towards their targets by Mossad, with the help of information from US satellites. Having supported Saddam throughout his war with Iran, Israel was now disclosing his crimes. Ostrovsky writes:   The Mossad leaders know that if they could make Saddam appear bad enough and a threat to the Gulf oil supply, of which he'd been the protector up to that point, then the United States and its allies would not let him get away with anything, but would take measures that would all but eliminate his army and his weapons potential, especially if they were led to believe that this might just be their last chance before he went nuclear. 4)   The Israelis were so determined on this matter, and with regard to the United States, that on August 4, 1990, Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy issued a diplomatically worded threat to William Brown, the American ambassador to Israel, stating that Israel ""expects the U.S. will fulfill all of the goals it set for itself at the beginning of the gulf crisis,"" in other words that it attack Iraq. According to Levy, if the United States failed to do so, Israel would act unilaterally. 5)   It would be of enormous benefit to Israel to have the United States engage in the war and for Israel to remain entirely uninvolved: and that is indeed what happened.   Israel Forces the USA to War   However, the Israelis were actively involved in the United States' war plans. Some US staff officers involved in planning Operation Desert Storm received fine tactical advice from the Israelis that ""the best way of wounding Saddam was to strike at his family.""   The Mossad-inspired propaganda campaign reported by Ostrovsky set up the necessary public backing for the Gulf War. It was again Mossad local assistants who lit the touchpaper for the war. The Hill and Knowlton lobbying firm, run by Tom Lantos of the Israeli lobby, prepared a dramatic scenario to convince members of Congress on the subject of war against Saddam. Turan Yavuz, a noted Turkish journalist, describes the incident:   October 9, 1990. The Hill and Knowlton lobbying firm organizes a sitting in Congress on the subject of ""Iraq's Barbarities."" A number of ""eye witnesses"" brought to the session by the lobbying firm maintain that Iraqi troops killed new-born babies in the hospital wards. One ""eye witness"" describes the savagery in enormous detail, saying that Iraqi soldiers killed 300 new-born babies in one hospital alone. This information deeply disturbs the members of Congress. This works to President Bush's advantage. However, it later emerges that the eye witness brought by Hill and Knowlton to Congress is in fact the daughter of the Kuwaiti ambassador to Washington. Nevertheless, the daughter's account is sufficient for members of Congress to give Saddam the nickname ""Hitler"". 6)   This leads to just one conclusion: that Israel played an important role in the United States' to wage its first war on Iraq. The second one is not much different.   The Pretext of ""War Against Terrorism""   Contrary to popular belief, the plan to attack Iraq and overthrow Saddam Hussein's regime by force was prepared and placed on Washington's agenda long before the genesis of the ""war against terrorism,"" which emerged in the wake of September 11. The first indication of this plan emerged in 1997. A group of pro-Israeli hawkish strategists in Washington D.C. began to put forward the scenario of the invasion of Iraq by manipulating the ""neo-con"" think-tank, called PNAC (Project for The New American Century). The most notable names in the PNAC were those of Donald Rumsfeld and ###### Cheney, who as defense secretary and vice-president would be the most influential figures in the George W. Bush administration.   An article titled ""Invading Iraq Not a New Idea for Bush Clique: 4 Years Before 9/11 Plan Was Set"" written by William Brunch and published in the Philadelphia Daily News, sets out the following facts:   But in reality, Rumsfeld, Vice President ###### Cheney, and a small band of conservative ideologues had begun making the case for an American invasion of Iraq as early as 1997 - nearly four years before the Sept. 11 attacks and three years before President Bush took office.   An obscure, ominous-sounding right-wing policy group called Project for the New American Century, or PNAC - affiliated with Cheney, Rumsfeld, Rumsfeld's top deputy Paul Wolfowitz and Bush's brother Jeb - even urged then-President Clinton to invade Iraq back in January 1998. 7)   Is Oil the Real Objective?   Why were the PNAC members so determined to attack Iraq? The same article continues:  While oil is a backdrop to PNAC's policy pronouncements on Iraq, it doesn't seem to be the driving force. [Ian] Lustick, [a University of Pennsylvania political science professor and Middle East expert,] while a critic of the Bush policy, says oil is viewed by the war's proponents primarily as a way to pay for the costly military operation.   ""I'm from Texas, and every oil man that I know is against military action in Iraq,"" said PNAC's Schmitt. ""The oil market doesn't need disruption.""   Lustick believes that a more powerful hidden motivator may be Israel. He said Bush administration hawks believe that a show of force in Iraq would somehow convince Palestinians to accept a peace plan on terms favorable to Israel- 8)   This, therefore, is the principal motivation behind the plan to attack Iraq: to serve Israel's Middle East strategy.   This fact has also been identified by other Middle East experts. Cengiz ?andar, a Turkish Middle East expert, for instance, describes the real power behind the plan to attack Iraq thus:   ... Who is directing the attack on Iraq? Vice-President ###### Cheney, Defense Secretary Rumsfeld, National Security Adviser Condoleeza Rice. These are the ""senior level"" backers of the attack. Yet the rest of the iceberg is even richer and more interesting. There are a number of ""lobbies.""  Heading these lobbies are the Jewish Institute for Security Affairs team, pro-Likud and Israeli-right and known for their close relations with US arms manufacturers. These have close relations with the ""arms lobby,"" Lockheed, Northrop, General Dynamics and Israeli military industries ... JINSA's fundamental principle is this: America's and Israel's security are inseparable. In other words, they are the same thing.   JINSA's objective is not solely the overthrow of the Saddam regime in Iraq: it also supports the overthrow of the Saudi Arabian, Syrian, Egyptian and Iranian regimes with a logic of ""total war,"" and the subsequent importation of ""democracy."" ... In other words, a number of American Jews on the same wavelength as the most extreme factions in Israel at the moment comprise the hawks in Washington. 9)   The Israeli Strategy for The Muslim Middle East   In short, there are those in Washington who are encouraging a war aimed first at Iraq and then at Saudi Arabia, Syria, Iran and Egypt. The most distinguishing feature of these is that they are lined up alongside, and even equivalent to, the ""Israeli lobby.""   No matter how much they speak of ""American interests,"" these people are actually supporting Israeli interests. A strategy of waging war against the whole of the Middle East and turning all the peoples of the region against it cannot be to the United States' advantage. The adoption of such a strategy can only be possible if the United States is bound to Israel, by means of the Israeli lobby, which is profoundly influential in this country's foreign policy.   It is for these reasons that behind the strategy which began to be set in motion after September 11 and is aimed at re-arranging the entire Islamic world, lies Israel's strategy for dominating the Middle East. Ever since its foundation, Israel has aimed at restructuring the Middle East, making it manageable and secure to itself. The search for security is of course a legitimate one, but the way that Israel chose to achieve this end is wrong: From the beginning, Israel decided to establish security behind an ""iron wall"" that would separate itself from the Arabs, and most important of all, protect the lands that Israel occupied through methods of invasion, colonization and depopulation. This strategy of reaping the wind had its consequence as a century of constant clash between Israelis and Arabs. Had Israel chosen a peaceful path to secure its existence, by building good relations with its Arab neighbors and refraining from aggression, Jews and Muslims could peacefully co-exist in the Middle East, as they have done before for centuries.   However, the radical Zionist ideology still denies any chance to peace and relentlessly tries to transform the whole Middle East to create a ""living space"" for Israel. It has been using its influence in the United States for that purpose in recent years, and to a large extent directs Washington's Middle East policy. The post-September 11 climate gave Israel the opportunity it had been seeking. Pro-Israeli ideologues who for years had been propounding the falsehood that Islam itself - not some militant radicals who use Islam as a shelter - posed a threat to the West and the United States, and who encouraged the mistaken concept of a ""clash of civilizations,"" have been trying to incite the United States against the Islamic world in the wake of September 11. As early as 1995, Israel Shahak of the Jerusalem Hebrew University wrote former Israeli Prime Minister Rabin's obsession with ""the idea of an Israeli-led anti-Islamic crusade"". Nahum Barnea, a commentator from the Israeli newspaper Yediot Ahronot, stated that same year that Israel was making progress ""[to] become the Western vanguard in the war against the Islamic enemy."" 10)   All that has happened in the years which have followed is that Israeli hawks have made their intentions even clearer. The political climate in the wake of September 11 prepared the ground for this intention to be made a reality.   The Only Way to World Peace: An Islamic Union   The situation may be summarized as follows: Israel's aim is to reshape the Middle East in line with its own strategic interests. In order to do this, it needs a ""world power."" That power is the United States; and Israeli hawks, thanks to their influence there, are trying to wage a militant American strategy against the Islamic world. Although Israel is a small state with a population of only 4.5 million, the plans drawn up by Israeli strategists and their counterparts in the West are directing the world affairs.   What needs to be done in the face of this?   1) ""Counter lobby activities"" need to be adopted in the face of the Israeli lobby's influence in the United States in order to develop dialogue between the United States and the Islamic world and to invite it to seek peaceful solutions to Iraq and similar problems. A wide section of the United States wishes to see their country adopt a fairer Middle East policy. Many statesmen, strategists, journalists and intellectuals have expressed this, and a ""peace of civilizations"" movement must be carried forward in cooperation with them. The approach inviting the US administration to peaceful solutions must be carried forward at governmental and civil society organization level.   2) A reconciliation between Israel and the Muslim Middle East must be sought. There are many ""peaceniks"", i.e. pro-peace Israelis, too. Many Israeli statesmen, religious leader, opinion leaders and many Jews from all around the world are urging the Israeli state to refrain from its brutal occupation and accept a just peace to live along with their Arab neighbors. Cooperation with them, especially on the inter-faith level, should be initiated and encouraged. One thing should never be forgotten: The rise of radicalism, enmity and violence is bad for all parties.   3) Alongside all this, a deeper rooted solution lies in a project which can resolve all the problems between the Islamic world and the West and deal with the fragmentation, suffering and poverty in the Islamic world and totally alter it: An Islamic Union. Recent developments have shown that the whole world, not just Islamic regions, stands in need of an ""Islamic Union."" This Union should heal the radical elements in the Islamic World, and establish good relations between Muslim countries and the West, especially the United States.   This Union, can find a solution to the mother of all problems: The Arab-Israeli conflict. With Israel retreating to its pre-67 borders and Arabs recognizing its right to exist, there can be real peace in the Middle East. And Jews and Muslims - both Children of Abraham and believers in one true God - may peacefully co-exist in the Holy Land, as they have done during the past centuries. Then, Israel would need no strategy to destabilize or divide the Arab States. And it will not have to face the results of occupation in forms of terrorism and constant fear of annihilation. Then, both the Israeli and Iraqi (and Palestinian) children may grow up in peace and security. That is a Middle East that any sane person should work to see.   ------------------------------------------------------------------------   1- (ed.)

In fact, Israel's policy aimed at the fragmentation of Iraq has lengthy historical roots-   The Age-Old Israeli Plan to Divide Iraq   An ambitious report entitled ""A Strategy for Israel in the 1980s,"" which appeared in the World Zionist Organization's periodical Kivunim in February 1982 disclosed a strategy aimed at making the whole of the Middle East a kind of ""living space"" for Israel. The report, drawn up by Oded Yinon, an Israeli journalist and formerly attached to the Foreign Ministry of Israel, set out the scenario of the ""division of Iraq"" in these terms:   Iraq, rich in oil on the one hand and internally torn on the other, is guaranteed as a candidate for Israel's targets. Its dissolution is even more important for us than that of Syria- Iraq is, once again, no different in essence from its neighbors, although its majority is Shi'ite and the ruling minority Sunni. Sixty-five percent of the population has no say in politics, in which an elite of 20 percent holds the power. In addition there is a large Kurdish minority in the north, and if it weren't for the strength of the ruling regime, the army and the oil revenues, Iraq's future state would be no different than that of Lebanon in the past- In Iraq, a division into provinces along ethnic/religious lines as in Syria during Ottoman times is possible. So, three (or more) states will exist around the three major cities: Basra, Baghdad and Mosul, and Shi'ite areas in the south will separate from the Sunni and Kurdish north. 1)   This was not the only announcement of the Israeli plan to atomize Middle East, including Iraq. As Israel Shahak, the notable Israeli scholar known for his dedication to a peaceful solution in the Middle East, explained that Yinon was just echoing the views of Israeli hawks:   The idea that all the Arab states should be broken down, by Israel, into small units, occurs again and again in Israeli strategic thinking. For example, Ze'ev Schiff, the military correspondent of Ha'aretz (and probably the most knowledgeable in Israel, on this topic) writes about the ""best"" that can happen for Israeli interests in Iraq: ""The dissolution of Iraq into a Shi'ite state, a Sunni state and the separation of the Kurdish part"" (Ha'aretz 6/2/1982). Actually, this aspect of the plan is very old. 2)   Thus, the plan was a serious one and this has been confirmed by the age-old Israeli support to non-Arab or non-Muslim minorities in the Muslim Arab states. The rebellious Kurds of northern Iraq was one of these strategic allies of Israel. During their revolt against the Baghdad regime, 1961-75, they have been financially and militarily supported by Israel. Israelis would love to see them carve up the northern part of Iraq, no matter how bloody and devastating such a civil war would be. However, the revolt failed in 1975, after loosing the support of its major patron, the Shah.   Fifteen years later, a new opportunity arose for Israel, an opportunity from the ambitions of the Iraqi dictator, Saddam Hussein.   Israel's Role in the Gulf War   Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein, after his bloody war against Iran in the 80's, invaded Kuwait in a sudden attack on August 1, 1990, giving rise to an international crisis. Israel headed the list of those forces that encouraged that crisis. Israel was the fiercest supporter of the attitude adopted by the United States in the wake of the invasion of Kuwait. The Israelis even regarded the United States as moderate, and wanted a harsher policy. To such an extent in fact that the President of Israel Chaim Herzog recommended that the American use nuclear weapons. On the other hand, the Israeli lobby in the United States was working to bring about a wide-ranging attack on Iraq.   This whole situation encouraged the idea in the United States that the attack against Iraq under consideration was actually planned in Israel's interests. Pat Buchanan summarized this idea in the words ""There are only two groups that are beating the drums for war in the Middle East - the Israeli Defense Ministry and its amen corner in the United States.""   Israelis had also initiated a serious propaganda campaign on the issue. Since this campaign was largely waged in secret, Mossad also entered the equation. Rogue Mossad agent Victor Ostrovsky provides important information on this subject. According to Ostrovsky, Israel had wanted to wage war with the United States against Saddam long before the Gulf crisis. So much so in fact, that Israel began to implement the plan immediately after the Iran-Iraq war. Ostrovsky reports that Mossad's Psychological Warfare department (LAP - LohAma Psychologist) set about an effective pro-war campaign using misinformation techniques. 3)   A Mossad Agent Describes the Gulf War   Ostrovsky describes how Mossad used agents or sympathizers in various parts of the world in this campaign. Among the tools employed in the campaign were the horrible massacres done by missiles launched against civilian targets in Iran during the Iran-Iraq war. As Ostrovsky makes clear, Mossad's later use of these missiles as a propaganda tool was quite peculiar, since those missiles had actually been directed towards their targets by Mossad, with the help of information from US satellites. Having supported Saddam throughout his war with Iran, Israel was now disclosing his crimes. Ostrovsky writes:   The Mossad leaders know that if they could make Saddam appear bad enough and a threat to the Gulf oil supply, of which he'd been the protector up to that point, then the United States and its allies would not let him get away with anything, but would take measures that would all but eliminate his army and his weapons potential, especially if they were led to believe that this might just be their last chance before he went nuclear. 4)   The Israelis were so determined on this matter, and with regard to the United States, that on August 4, 1990, Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy issued a diplomatically worded threat to William Brown, the American ambassador to Israel, stating that Israel ""expects the U.S. will fulfill all of the goals it set for itself at the beginning of the gulf crisis,"" in other words that it attack Iraq. According to Levy, if the United States failed to do so, Israel would act unilaterally. 5)   It would be of enormous benefit to Israel to have the United States engage in the war and for Israel to remain entirely uninvolved: and that is indeed what happened.   Israel Forces the USA to War   However, the Israelis were actively involved in the United States' war plans. Some US staff officers involved in planning Operation Desert Storm received fine tactical advice from the Israelis that ""the best way of wounding Saddam was to strike at his family.""   The Mossad-inspired propaganda campaign reported by Ostrovsky set up the necessary public backing for the Gulf War. It was again Mossad local assistants who lit the touchpaper for the war. The Hill and Knowlton lobbying firm, run by Tom Lantos of the Israeli lobby, prepared a dramatic scenario to convince members of Congress on the subject of war against Saddam. Turan Yavuz, a noted Turkish journalist, describes the incident:   October 9, 1990. The Hill and Knowlton lobbying firm organizes a sitting in Congress on the subject of ""Iraq's Barbarities."" A number of ""eye witnesses"" brought to the session by the lobbying firm maintain that Iraqi troops killed new-born babies in the hospital wards. One ""eye witness"" describes the savagery in enormous detail, saying that Iraqi soldiers killed 300 new-born babies in one hospital alone. This information deeply disturbs the members of Congress. This works to President Bush's advantage. However, it later emerges that the eye witness brought by Hill and Knowlton to Congress is in fact the daughter of the Kuwaiti ambassador to Washington. Nevertheless, the daughter's account is sufficient for members of Congress to give Saddam the nickname ""Hitler"". 6)   This leads to just one conclusion: that Israel played an important role in the United States' to wage its first war on Iraq. The second one is not much different.   The Pretext of ""War Against Terrorism""   Contrary to popular belief, the plan to attack Iraq and overthrow Saddam Hussein's regime by force was prepared and placed on Washington's agenda long before the genesis of the ""war against terrorism,"" which emerged in the wake of September 11. The first indication of this plan emerged in 1997. A group of pro-Israeli hawkish strategists in Washington D.C. began to put forward the scenario of the invasion of Iraq by manipulating the ""neo-con"" think-tank, called PNAC (Project for The New American Century). The most notable names in the PNAC were those of Donald Rumsfeld and ###### Cheney, who as defense secretary and vice-president would be the most influential figures in the George W. Bush administration.   An article titled ""Invading Iraq Not a New Idea for Bush Clique: 4 Years Before 9/11 Plan Was Set"" written by William Brunch and published in the Philadelphia Daily News, sets out the following facts:   But in reality, Rumsfeld, Vice President ###### Cheney, and a small band of conservative ideologues had begun making the case for an American invasion of Iraq as early as 1997 - nearly four years before the Sept. 11 attacks and three years before President Bush took office.   An obscure, ominous-sounding right-wing policy group called Project for the New American Century, or PNAC - affiliated with Cheney, Rumsfeld, Rumsfeld's top deputy Paul Wolfowitz and Bush's brother Jeb - even urged then-President Clinton to invade Iraq back in January 1998. 7)   Is Oil the Real Objective?   Why were the PNAC members so determined to attack Iraq? The same article continues:  While oil is a backdrop to PNAC's policy pronouncements on Iraq, it doesn't seem to be the driving force. [Ian] Lustick, [a University of Pennsylvania political science professor and Middle East expert,] while a critic of the Bush policy, says oil is viewed by the war's proponents primarily as a way to pay for the costly military operation.   ""I'm from Texas, and every oil man that I know is against military action in Iraq,"" said PNAC's Schmitt. ""The oil market doesn't need disruption.""   Lustick believes that a more powerful hidden motivator may be Israel. He said Bush administration hawks believe that a show of force in Iraq would somehow convince Palestinians to accept a peace plan on terms favorable to Israel- 8)   This, therefore, is the principal motivation behind the plan to attack Iraq: to serve Israel's Middle East strategy.   This fact has also been identified by other Middle East experts. Cengiz ?andar, a Turkish Middle East expert, for instance, describes the real power behind the plan to attack Iraq thus:   ... Who is directing the attack on Iraq? Vice-President ###### Cheney, Defense Secretary Rumsfeld, National Security Adviser Condoleeza Rice. These are the ""senior level"" backers of the attack. Yet the rest of the iceberg is even richer and more interesting. There are a number of ""lobbies.""  Heading these lobbies are the Jewish Institute for Security Affairs team, pro-Likud and Israeli-right and known for their close relations with US arms manufacturers. These have close relations with the ""arms lobby,"" Lockheed, Northrop, General Dynamics and Israeli military industries ... JINSA's fundamental principle is this: America's and Israel's security are inseparable. In other words, they are the same thing.   JINSA's objective is not solely the overthrow of the Saddam regime in Iraq: it also supports the overthrow of the Saudi Arabian, Syrian, Egyptian and Iranian regimes with a logic of ""total war,"" and the subsequent importation of ""democracy."" ... In other words, a number of American Jews on the same wavelength as the most extreme factions in Israel at the moment comprise the hawks in Washin"

9044,4201404,"11,August,2004",2004-08-11,"   The Untold StoryBackgroundChechens are one of the few peoples indigenous to the Caucasus Mountains. Chechens are one of the few peoples who are indigenous to the Caucasus Mountains. They are ethnically very different from the Slavic Russians. Even linguistically the Chechen language is in the class of languages called Ibro-Caucasian, making English, German, and French a lot closer to Russian than Chechen. More importantly, all Chechens are Muslims who have throughout their history resisted Russian occupation. Basically there are no historical or legal reasons for Russia to claim Chechnya part of the Russian federation. The barbaric ethnic cleansing that is going on today in Chechnyais the latest episode of a war that has lasted for over 300 hundredyears. Chechens have never in their history joined any type of union or signed any piece of paper entitling Russia the right torule their land. Going as far back as the 16th century, Russia has repeatedly practice ethnic cleansing against the Chechens and therest of the north Caucasian Muslim nations. In the first Chechen war of 1994-1996, 12% of the Chechen population perished, that is about 120 thousand lives, almost all civilians. And that is no accident. It is typical of the way the Russia wages war. In 1944, the entire Chechen nation was exiled from its land along with the majority of the Muslim nations of the north Caucasus.During this forced migration 60% of people perished from cold, hunger and diseases. The idea was to dissolve the Chechen identity altogether. Simply put, for as long as there is a Chechen living in the north Caucasus, Russian politicians will not be free to rule the region. During this close to 400 hundred years of war, the Russians have never fought a clean war. They have repeatedly targeted the Chechen civilians, only because they have never won face-to-face combat against the Chechen freedom fighters, by Allah's grace that will never happen. On the other hand the Chechens have always been very humane to their captives. In the last war scores of POWs caught by the Chechens embraced Islam. Many more young conscripts were returned to their mothers. However, no mercy was ever shown to the mercenaries or military pilots that killed civilians. At the end of the 20-month-old war the Russian army pulled out of Chechnya dragging its tail between its legs.The last war has left Chechnya and its people crippled. What little industry was there is totally destroyed. Utility services are nonexistent. Hospitals lack everything from medication to equipment. Water is contaminated. A great percentage of the survivors are handicapped. Infant mortality rate is probably one of the highest in the world. In other words Chechnya and its population are in no state to wage war against so called a super power. The Russian FSB has been busy waging a propaganda war against the Chechen people. The kidnappings were started in order to make sure the outside world would stay far away from Chechnya. Members of humanitarian organizations that dared enter Chechnya were brutally dismembered by orders of the Russian FSB.Russian government blew up apartments in Moscow killing about 300 Russian civilians, then turned around and blamed it on the Chechens. All this was done to justify invading Chechnya. The way the apartment bombings were carried out required a high expertise in the matter of bringing down buildings. This is a rare expertise, which the Chechens never had. Had the Chechens had that expertise they would have demonstrated it against the Russian army by now.The Kremlin needs this war as a tool to make sure a president sympathetic to the current regime would win the next elections. Mr. Putin seems to fit that bill. More than likely he has promised that Yeltsin and his gang would not be prosecuted for stealing billions of dollars. Many, including some in the Russian media itself, have theorized that the Russian government is behind the apartment bombings. This is the enemy the Chechen people are facing. An enemy that does not even have mercy on its own civilians let alone the Chechen civilians.Our brothers and sisters in Chechnya and many decent freedom loving citizens of the world are wondered why no one is forcing the Russians to stop the bombing campaigns. All they see is destruction and mass murder. They do not see ""rebels"" hiding out or careful efforts by the Russians to avoid civilian targets. They watch as village after village is decimated indiscriminately. Most do not understand how this can be happening to them again. Only this time, worse. We urge you to respond to their cries.THE DESTRUCTIVE INVASION OF WAR IN CHECHNYA WHAT TO DO ?We ask all readers of this booklet to please follow this stepwise approach to face this very sad and disturbing human tragedy1. PrayÂ· Pray to Allah that He will help the Chechen innocent citizens to overcome their miseries, that He almighty will give them victory, and that He shows the mislead young members of the Russian army the truth in order to change their hearts to Islam.Â· Please ask the Imam of your masjid to include the Unfair Destructive War in Chechnya as the main issue of the Jumaa Prayers Ceremony (Khutba). Â· Hold a special ""prayer of need"" (Salatul Hajah) that is recommended in times of distress and great needs.Â· Remember the Chechens in your du'as. Supplicate for their well being. Ask Allah (SWT) to grant them strength, ease their difficulties and bring them out of this trial successfully. Â· Pray that the oppressor be punished. 2. DonateWe urge you to donate generously. Your donations will help us provide necessary humanitarian relief to the affected needy families and refugees through the services of accredited and experienced international Muslim relief agencies. 3. Educate & communicate Spread the word to and discuss the problem with Muslims and non-Muslims. Discuss the Chechen point of view and the right of the Chechen people to live in peace. Share the atrocities committed by the invading forces of the Russian army.Statement of Mujahideen Leadership from Grozny All Praise is to Allah. Prayers and blessings are upon His Messenger.Firstly: We thank all of our Muslim brethren everywhere who are with us in heart and spirit. The ones who provide us with supplications and support which undoubtedly affect the course of fighting.Secondly: We want to assure all the brethren that our current military situation is good and there is nothing to worry about. We are happy to inform them that the Mujahideen have stood up to many fierce Russian Army attacks. The current state of the Russian military is that of desperation and confusion. Care about civilian life is all but gone. The Russian Army forces started using ultra heavy artillery (1+ Tons) in the bombardment. The indiscriminate bombardment caused major losses among the unarmed civilians and huge destruction to the capital. Regarding the statement that the ""Mujahideen should not sacrifice all for the sake of non-strategic towns for life is more valuable that land"". As we previously stated, yes, we completely support this statement. We did not declare Jihad except to comply with the orders of Allah. We travel the path that pleases Allah. However, the reason we continue to defend the capital, which is of no strategic value to the Mujahideen, is that we wanted to prove to the world and the Russian Political and Military establishment that despite the size, power, or technology of an enemy, there is no way that they could defeat the people of belief, principle, and land. By protecting the capital for this long, we have broken the arrogance of the Russian Army and politicians. We caused them tremendous damage and broken the spirits of their soldiers and officers. This alone is considered a victory. We also repeatedly humiliated the Russian military leadership, who on many occasions, promised dates of entering the capital. The last of which was the first of January. Yet, to this date, they have not succeeded. Putin promised the world that the Russian flag would be waiving in Grozny by the beginning of the year. So, where are those flags of yours, Mr. Putin? Due to this failure, his credibility has plummeted among the Russian leadership. The ones who are anxiously waiting for something to happen so that they can save face in front of the world. By maintaining the capital we've obviously embarrassed them. This has resulted in the politicians loosing faith in their own military. The military whose defeats date back to Afghanistan, where they left humiliated.Thirdly: As we convey these points to our brethren, we have to bring their attention to an extremely important matter; When we made the decision to protect the capital, the ultimate goal of protecting the Religion, civilian life, and the Mujahideen did not escape our minds. When we contemplate a decision, we do our very best to base the final decision by weighing the pros and cons. Everyday, we continue to judge the benefits and prices resulting in maintaining the decision. We will ultimately continue what we believe pleases Allah and has benefits to the religion and Muslims regardless of the cost. If this results in leaving the capital, we will. We are not better than the companions fighting in the battle of Badr when they left Mu`tah. When Khalid led the Muslims in their departure, the messenger, prayers and blessings be upon him, was happy and considered it a victory. On the other hand, if we need to stay and protect the capital, then our best example is the Messenger of Allah, prayers and blessings are upon him. He believed in the victory and the promise of Allah where he -peace and blessings be upon him- led 300 men in fighting 1000 who also exceeded them in weaponry. As a result, regardless whether we go with the first or second option, our Religion is kind and merciful. Praise is to Allah who did not make our Religion difficult. This leaves us with the remaining variables, which are monetary, military, and political. The leaders in charge of defending the capital know the most about the variables and therefore are best to evaluate the situation. Thus, we want to ensure our brethren that we will not stop supporting what we believe is best for religion, life, and the Muslims. We continuously ask Allah and request that our brothers ask Allah to guide us to what is best for our religion and life. Finally: We request and urge all Muslims to stop listening to and ignore all Russian Political establishmentâ€™s propaganda and the western media who try to strengthen the spirits of the Russian Army with lies and fabrications of victories that never took place. If we decide to leave the capital, we will announce it via our own official sources. We ask Allah to raise his religion, grant victory to his supporters, and bestow defeat upon his enemy. Allah knows best and prayers and blessings are upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and all of his companions. Six Points Action Plan Recommended to the Muslims Worldwide1. Follow the authentic news of the Jihad in Chechnya from authentic sources. 2. Spread authentic news about what is happening in Chechnya to Muslims all over the world, through word-of-mouth, Friday sermons, leaflets, posters, friends in the Muslim and non-Muslim media, radio, TV, e-mail and the Internet. Media is an important part of this war.3. Boycott Russian companies and goods. Enforce all types of sanctions against Russia. 4. For the one who is able, to travel to Chechnya to give physical and financial assistance to their suffering Muslim brothers and sisters. One should NOT travel to Chechnya until he has definite contacts with Chechen groups, organizations, and centers or Islamic charitable organizations, which can confirm 100% that a safe route exists into Chechnya. All visas must be obtained prior to travel. Once inside Chechnya, one must join one of the many existing groups helping the afflicted Muslims in the area. 5. Lobby relatives, friends and contacts in Muslim governments to break off diplomatic relations with Russia, expel their ambassadors and shutdown their embassies, unless Russian unilaterally withdraws from Chechen soil. 6. At the very least, supplicate to Allah to give Victory to the believers and destroy the oppressors.THE CHRONOLOGY OF CHECHNYA-RUSSIA CONFLICT1. In 1864, Chechens, after a long and bloody struggle for freedom, surrendered to Tsarist Russia. 2. In 1877, Chechens rose up in arms against Russia but were subdued. 3. In 1901, about 700 families migrated from Chechenya to Turkey. Of this group, about 200 families returned to Chechenya, while 300 families settled in Turkey and 200 families settled in Jordan. 4. After WWI, the political and nationalist activists of the Republic of the North Caucasus Federation moved to Poland to escape Communist oppression. Upon signing the agreement, by Hitler and Stalin, to divide Poland between Nazi Germany and Russia these activists moved to France where their descendents live today. 5. After WWII, Chechen members of the Red Army who were prisoners of war in Nazi Germany refused to return to Chechenya since the Chechen nation had already been exiled in 1944 to Siberia by Stalin. These Chechens settled in Germany, Turkey and the U.S.A. 6. On May 11, 1918, the North Caucasus nations declared the formation of the Republic of the North Caucasus Federation. Germany, Ottoman Turkey, Austria, and Bulgaria in addition to Bolshevik Russia recognized this republic. 7. In 1922, in a reversal of its recognition, Bolshevik Russia invaded and occupied the Republic of the North Caucasus Federation. 8. Chechens rebelled against Russia in 1929 and again in 1940. Both times they were subdued in a bloody manner by the communist regime. 9. On Feb 23, 1944, the whole Chechen nation was exiled to Siberia by orders from Stalin. 10. After thirteen years of exile, the remaining Chechens were allowed to return to their ancestral homeland by Khrutchev in 1957. 11. Through the 70's, Soviet Russia treated Grozny (capital of Chechenya) as enemy territory, where nighttime curfews were imposed routinely. 12. On Nov 23 - 25 1990, a national Chechen conference convened in Grozny. The conference included delegates representing all ethnic groups of Chechenya, including Russians and Cossacks. 13. On Nov 25, 1990, the delegates to the conference declared the independence and sovereignty of Chechenya and its cessation from the former Soviet Union. 14. On Nov 27, 1990, the declaration of independence and sovereignty was unanimously ratified by the Soviet Parliament of the Chechen-Ingush Republic. 15. On Oct 27, 1991, in fulfillment of constitutional requirements, a national Chechen referendum was held. The Chechen nation approved the declaration of independence and elected General Dzhokar Dudayev as the first elected president of the independent Chechen Republic by a margin of 84% from among three contenders for presidency. 16. The former Soviet Union was dissolved at midnight Dec 31, 1992. 17. The former Russian Soviet Socialist Republic was dissolved and replaced by the Republic of the Russian Federation upon signing the federation treaty on Mar 13, 1992. 18. By the free will of the Chechen nation, Chechenya did not sign the treaty or join the federation. 19. Dec. 11 1994: Russian troops invade Chechnya with two tank units; the Chechen-war begins without Russia ever declaring war. 20. Aug 1996: Aslan Maskhadov, a former Soviet army officer who led Chechen rebel forces in the war, negotiates a peace agreement with Moscow's Alexander Lebed that provides for the pullout of the Russian troops and postpones an agreement on Chechnya's constitutional status until 2001. 21. Jan. 27, 1997: Aslan Maskhadov clearly wins elections and becomes Prime Minister in Chechnya's separatist government.22. Feb. 12, 1997: Chechnya's new president Aslan Maskhadov takes the oath of office under heavy security, pledging to strengthen the self-proclaimed independence of his Muslim republic. 23. May 12, 1997: Boris Yeltsin and Aslan Maskhadov sign a peace treaty which leaves open the question of independence, but confirms that Russia will acknowledge the norms of international law and not use force to settle disputes. Chechnya keeps the Russian ruble as currency. The treaty also clears the way for commissioned use of Chechyan oil pipelines by Russia.Council of Europe Must Act on Chechnya(Strasbourg, January 25, 2000)--Human Rights Watch today called on European parliamentarians meeting in Strasbourg to take a tough stand on Russia's war in Chechnya. ""The Council of Europe's top priority must be getting a sustained international monitoring presence in Ingushetia,"" said Peter Bouckaert, Human Rights Watch's representative in the northern Caucasus, who traveled to Strasbourg to press his case with members of the Council of Europe's Parliamentary Assembly holding their quarterly meeting this week. ""Having people from the international community on the ground to bear witness to what is happening is the best means of getting some immediate relief. If the Russian Federation is serious about living up to its commitments to the Council of Europe, it must agree to such scrutiny.""Rape Allegations Surface in Chechnya(Nazran, January 20, 2000)--Russian soldiers have been raping Chechen women in areas of Russian-controlled Chechnya, Human Rights Watch charged today. A team of Human Rights Watch investigators in Ingushetia has spoken to a number of Chechen refugees who saw the bodies of victims, or had conversations with women who had been raped.""Rape is a war crime, and these allegations about rape in Chechnya are very serious,"" said Regan Ralph, executive director of the Women's Rights Division of Human Rights Watch. She stressed that according to international law, any single rape could be a war crime.Human Rights Watch researchers in southern Russia have learned that thousands of elderly, poor, and infirm civilians remained trapped in Chechen combat zones. Civilians who have managed to flee the region report that bus drivers, border guards, and corrupt officials are charging exorbitant prices for persons seeking to flee the fighting, forcing the most underprivileged persons to remain behind. They are trapped between Chechen fighters and advancing Russian troops, are unable to escape, and have no access to running water, electricity, heating, or food supply. Most essential services in Grozny and other large towns have ceased functioning.""This kind of predatory extortion for compliance with residence permits is bad enough in peacetime as a violation of freedom of movement,"" commented Holly Cartner, executive director of Human Rights Watch's Europe and Central Asia division. ""But these are helpless civilians fleeing armed conflict. The Russian government has a legal obligation to protect them.""A Reminder from Al-Qur'an and SunnahOur beloved Prophet (peace be upon him) said: â€œA Muslim is a brother of another Muslim, so he should not oppress, nor should he hand him over to an oppressor. Whoever fulfilled the needs of his brother, Allah will fulfill his needs; whoever brought his brother out of a discomfort, Allah will bring him out of discomforts on the day of resurrection, and whoever screened a Muslim, Allah will screen him on the Day of Resurrection.â€ (Sahih Bukhari)â€œWhatever you spend in the way of Allah, it is for your own good, when you spend not for anybodyâ€™s pleasure except that of Allah. Thus whatever you spend for any good work you will get full benefit of it and you will not be wronged to the slightest extent.â€ (Al-Qurâ€™an 2:272)â€œAnd in their wealth have due share of those who ask for help and those who are deprived.â€ (Al-Qurâ€™an 51:19) him.â€œThose who spend their property by night and by day, secretly and openly, they shall have their reward from their Lord and they shall have no fear, nor shall they grieve.â€ (Al-Qurâ€™an 2:274)Brothers and Sisters, both Al-Quran and As-Sunnah have urged us to spend in the cause of Allah (SWT).

I dont want to end up like my sister, or my mother, they chose their road in life and that is not one i want to travel. I dont want to have a baby when im 18 or 19 and have no way to support it, and then have it have a dead beat dad. My dad was a dead beat, always druck always in jail, never cared a thing about us. I never new my dad at all, he left when my brother and i were 9 months old, and never came back. I did finally get to see him though, it the coffin they were burying him in, never really felt anything on that day. Well enough of that, i hate, well i guess, it's my past, and my future. I hope i can make it far away from here, i hope so much. "

Taking into consideration how many orphans there are in Russia and what frightining conditions they live in it is hard to understand why our goverment does everything to complicate the adoptation process. Right now only seriously sick children can be adopted by a foreigner with relative ease.

The conspiracy was so high that the railroad station of the town was named Otdih (Rest), to pretend that it is another dacha's area in suburbs of Moscow. The funny thing is that the station is still called Otdih and even more, in description of how to get to the show the organizers don't mention station Otdih the nearest to the aerodrome. Conspiracy is still on a level.  If the weather won't spoil i highly recommend visiting the show.

Needless to say, it was extremely easy for Mr. Zhuravlyov to buy his way out of Russian jail: there is no such thing as juror protection in Moscow, so if any gentleman on that jury could not be bought outright, he could be easily and cheaply intimidated by thugs working for the defendant.  It proved a more difficult task, however, to obtain adequate protection from Mr. Zhuravlyov's own colleagues. Unsurprisingly for a man of his trade, he used to have too many enemies, and they proved more efficient in dealing with him, than both local police and the courts.

Eco del Mar might be quite a distance from Chukotka, of which Abramovich is the guv, but so is the borough of Chelsea, so who cares.  What's interesting, though, is that we keep hearing about all sorts of Abramovich acquisitions lately, and some 80% of these rumours lately prove totally unfounded. It seems like there's someone behind the stories â€” obviously a ressourceful someone, who badly needs to infuriate both Roman's poorer compatriots and his Kremlin partners with all those headlines.   If this plot ever succeeds, Abramovich will have to chose between the paths of his two ex-partners: Mr. Berezovsky, who fled to London, and Mr. Khodorkovsky, who chose jail in his hometown. Regardless of Roman's ultimate choice (I'd bet on him fleeing, 100:1), his carefully amassed wealth, worth billions, will come up for grabs, and our Ressourceful Someone expects himself to be among the first invited to the looting festival...

7999,4210703,"22,August,2004",2004-08-22,"   I don't know how they do it.  Writers are notorious for being drinkers.  To me, there's nothing more difficult than writing while drunk or hungover.  I'm experiencing the latter right about now.  I'm feeling like a machine that's out of order, and I'll be writing about the latest dysfunction in my life.  Weird.  My friends have had to endure listening to my endless bitching about how hard it's been for me to meet guys for the past eight months.  Yesterday I met up with a guy, and it was a disaster, much like every experience with guys this year.  He was sweet, very cute, and I enjoyed listening to him talk.  The problem was that I couldn't be fully engaged in the conversation.  I just didn't know what to say.  I was totally zoning out, and my mind drifted to random crap that had nothing to do with our conversation.  All I wanted to do was lay down and rest.  I wish it were perfectly normal to just say to someone, ""Hey, I know we just met, and I know I'm the one who suggested hanging out, but is there anyway we could save conversation for later and just lay down and stare at the clouds?""   Therein lies the problem I guess.  I'm too stressed out and focused right now to be dating.  Plus I'm continuously working through issues I've had with my ex-boyfriend.  But the process of working on my goals and working through past-relationship shit has never felt lonelier nor more difficult.  I suppose once I get through it  all I'll be a stronger person, but when you're thick in the middle of the process, the end seems nowhere in sight.    When I'm having a hard time practicing for the LSAT, I wonder, Gee, if I had someone to care about and vice versa, maybe I'd be having an easier time focusing instead of feeling like this ghost of a person.  It bothers me that I've assigned the most meaning to my life in terms of how well I do on a stupid fucking test .  I have a lot around people around me that I'm grateful for, and little by little I'm recognizing things about myself that make me appreciate life and give me meaning, but for some reason, I feel it necesssary to share it all with someone.  Sometimes I think what I have is too much for me to handle alone.  I've been stuck on thinking what the next sentence should be for quite some time and tie things together because right now, everything is rather disjointed.  The only thought that occurred to me to let words keep flowing is that maybe, just maybe, I'm so worried about the possibility of failing that if it does occur, I'll feel so broken and low that I won't be able to depend on myself to cope with it.  I'd have my friends, but it's not the same as having someone you love there by your side.  God, I wonder if people who grew up in healthy families exeperience this kind of bullshiit.  All of this sounds like trite, cliched crap.  But you know, it's the kind of stuff that helps uncrowd my mind.    I think I can study now...  "
8000,4210703,"20,August,2004",2004-08-20,"   When I was in the Creative Writing program at SFSU, I had to do a ton of writing exercises each week.  It got the point where I felt like I was out of ideas completely.  Or in other instances, I'd stare at my computer screen, and whatever ideas I'd have in my head earlier in the day no longer seemed fresh and interesting when I tried to flesh them out.    That's how I feel now.  I've been trying to think of something good to say in my next post, but feared it would only come off as, ""whoa is me, my life is a bitch.""  I'd have damn good reason to think that though.  I might explain that in a bit.    But this thought was particularly striking to me today.  I was pretty desperate to clasp on to a dramatic idea/fantasy in my head to literally force upon myself a fresh perspective of life.  It sort of worked.  While fighting off a very strong wave of post-lunch food coma at work, I got it in my head to finally call my doctor about my x-ray results.  Earlier in the week I went to the doctor because I've been getting short of breath and have been having trouble breathing in general.  For someone at 26 years-old, that's pretty unusual.  So I got it checked out.    The receptionist who answered my call kind of weirded me out.  After she looked up my information, her warm disposition shifted to clinical efficiency when she asked,  ""what number do you prefer to be reached at for a private message?""  I held my already shallow breath out of surprise.  What was this about, I thought.  I gave her my number slowly, hoping she'd detect the concern she raised in me, and then she abruptly told me the doctor will get back to me and hung up.   When I put the phone down, I thought, God, what if this is something serious?  I wasn't prepared for this.  And then a sick idea popped in my head: So what?  So what if it serious?  I got to thinking that if my days were numbered, maybe I'd start appreciating life a bit more.  And I was!  I was sitting in my cubicle thinking about how short life is, and in my case, how it may be even shorter.  The papers around me, the keyboard I was touching, the office walls and other cubicles all looked beautiful to me.  Every thing I felt bad about in my life seemed so trivial.    I don't know how the suddenly appreciative perspective wore off, but it did, and it disappeared rather instantly.  It was like I walked through a fog and into light, and when I turned back to look at the fog, it wasn't there anymore.  I could see everything as being just as shitty as I remembered it being always.  The doctor never called me back.  I still have no idea what answer to expect about my x-ray results.  But I'll tell ya- I'm not too worried about it.  Even if I get bad news, I know that things might not change about how I see life.  Why should it have to?    It's a sad thing to cling on to ideas of hope over and over again just to let it bring you down.  I realize that the stuff I'm saying is all a reflection of stuff going on in my life.  If things were going better, I'd have a better attitude.  All the time, there will be people who say having a better attitude makes thing go better in life.  Those people are either heavily medicated, criminally stupid, or have so much sex that they have no time to actually engage and be part of the workings of society.    Yeah, rather than chronicle the mundane details of all that ails me, I enjoyed bitching about the larger picture.  "
8001,4210703,"16,August,2004",2004-08-16,"   I called my oldest sister to wish her a happy birthday.  This was a big deal.  I don't keep in touch with my family that much.  I'm not mad at them.  We're on speaking terms.  It's just that they're all far older than me, so they all feel like cousins than actual siblings.  But I suppose from their perspective, I'll always be their little brother.  For me, I'm just not big into family, and I keep my distance.  Why bother getting closer now?  Plus the family just keeps getting bigger every year.  There's just no way I can keep up with everyone.    Well, I sort of did some catching up with sis and with her husband.  I didn't quite tell them, ""Oh, by the way, I'm a big homo.""  It's not like they don't already know.  What's my personal life got to do with them?    A lot, apparently.    My brother-in-law told me about how my sister keeps telling everybody how much of a striking similarity there is between her oldest son and me.  She's definitely qualified to make an accurate assesment because in a way, she's the one who went to my parent-teacher conferences, informational meetings, and other chaperoned events since my mom didn't (and still doesn't) speak English and my dad was (and is still) always working.  She spent a lot of time with me in a parental kind of way.  But just the basics of course.  She had her own life to live too while leaving more motherly duties for my actual mom to take of.    Despite all she's done, I've always sort of been jealous of my sister.  She's smart, pretty, and married well.  She's got a good life, and now so do her three kids.  Although, her oldest son, who I think is about 12 years old (see how much I keep up with my family!), I'm not sure will have it so easy.  While I was still in NY, I sort of got to watch him grow up.  He was a little brat, and he was difficult to deal with because he's also very bright.  Smart kids are the worst to be around.  He didn't endear himself to me.  As he got older, I became aware that I didn't really like my nephew because I noticed the many similarities we shared.  He was a bit of a sissy.  He liked pink, didn't like playing sports, was overly emotional, always wanted to be around Mom and always had to be the center of attention.  When I visited home recently after not seeing him for over a year, the only thing that changed about him was his height.    The kid has a bright future.  He's got parents who can be more involved in his life than mine ever were.  His family is more well-off, and I hate to say it, but the little brat may end up being smarter and better-looking than me.  But he's going to have endure so much torture in school for being who he is, and he may lose so much of what makes him stand out as an exceptional person.  Sure, people of all walks of life had to endure junior high and high school trauma.  But there's something absolutely brutal about growing up in a Republican environment right outside of NYC, like Long Island, where he is.  The bullies have something more tangible to compare you with.  They see first-hand all the ""freaks"" their parents keep them sheltered from whenever they make a trip into the city.  Worse yet, they've got the smarts, braun, and money to try to make your life a living hell if you're not like them.  My nephew is in for a horrible, depressing journey to adulthood.  I think about the distance I keep from my family, and how I don't share my personal life with them.  Sometimes I think that if I can help spare my nephew  just one ounce of grief that I had to endure while growing up, maybe he'll have less pain than what I've had to live with.  Maybe he'll never have to feel washed-up at a young age.  No matter what I do, it won't be easy for him.    One way I want to help him out is to follow my dream.  I always wanted to be successful when I grew up: be a famous actor, have a few books published, or just be rich and happy.  Silly measures of success to some people, I know, but that's what I wanted.  Each time I think about how much shit I had to put up with just to be happy with my life, I realize how much I survived and how strong I have been.  And now I deal with the arduous task of trying to get into a top law school and becoming a successful lawyer who will also one day write fiction books too, and it can all be too overwhelming for me to handle- almost to the point where I want to quit.  I guess I should keep working towards my goal so that my nephew has someone to look up to.  Maybe my success will get him through the days of his self-discovery and give him hope that one day, everything will be all right.  "
8002,4210703,"14,August,2004",2004-08-14,"   Today I saw a lesbian couple get off the bus.  The one with the shaved head walked beside her lover with her head in the air like she was entranced by angels singing to them about their love.  She smiled.  Her face was peaceful.  If someone took a snapshot of her, cropped out everything and everyone around her and just presented her image out of context, they'd think she took a shot of morphine.  She looked like an idiot.  It made me think, ""Good fucking, god.  Did I ever look that stupid when I had a boyfriend?""  And instantly I remembered, Yes.  I have seen pictures in which I have a ridiculous ear-to-ear grin on my face while standing next to my special someone.  That smiling, happy creature seems like a stranger to me now.  I've officially been single for too long (or maybe finally, long enough to have clarity) because I've come to the conclusion that couples are truly, deeply odd.  I've forgotten how people become couples, why they become couples, what makes them stay couples- it's a foreign country to me again.  This one-time serial monogamist is now completely baffled by the concept of relationships.  Brings me to my next point: Logic.  For anyone who has taken or will take the LSAT, they will discover it is a very difficult test with no prior education in formal logic.  It is especially difficult if you have lived your life by your own  means of logic, and not the standardized methods used by others use to rationalize opinions, beliefs and arguments.  I came to the conclusion that for the 26 years of my life, I've been living as an insane person, simply going around saying (in paraphrase), ""This is so, because I've decreed it so.""  I always humored myself with that line of thinking, but it's not so funny when you're trying to do well on a test that measures how well you apply logic principles.    Where exactly is this going?  My decision to become a lawyer is either sucking the creative life-blood out of me that I regretfully neglected, or it's helping me to become a well-adjusted adult that sets goals and actually takes steps to accomplish them.  I'm starting to think being creative and being well-adjusted are mutually exclusive.  Before this idea of becoming lawyer-John, I had love, I read tons of books, I wrote, and I had fun even with having to endure extreme poverty.  Logical thinking is not part of who I am.  It is eating my soul alive and turning me into someone I don't know anymore.  I have a different way of thinking that sometimes makes me feel like someone else's brain has been transplanted into my skull.  And the strangest thing of all- despite this drastic transformation I'm undergoing, I can almost say that I'm happy to be going through it.  I just don't know how the journey will end.  What if I don't become a writer nor a laywer?  What if keep going through life just being a peon?    There's no hidden message here of save yourself, follow your dream and all that bullshit.  Sometimes things ""are ""just because that's the way they ""are"".  It's not inherently good, or bad.  It's what you make of it.  Right now, life for me now is like a giant pile of manuer.  Someone recently told me that in some regions all over the world, manuer is mixed with dirt and clay to build beautiful feats of architecture.    Reminds me of the wisest thing I've read in my life.  I went to the bathroom at this Indian resturant.  Right above the toilet paper roll, someone scribbled: ""Nothing is True Everything is Permissible.""  Just like that.  No punctuation.  I tried to make sense of it all in my head, and then I was like, ""Holy Shit!  That's just like on the LSAT.""  Assume whatever you want to be true.  Knock yourself out.  It doesn't really matter unless you want it to.  Relationships, LSAT questions, writing- these things are all fighting for title of what matters most.  In my convoluted way, I laid out some stuff I think about.  I bet it was a real bitch to make sense of all that l said.  Now you know how I feel.  "
8003,4210703,"12,August,2004",2004-08-12,"   So I put the hummus away, stopped surfing online, and am trying to quiet the thoughts of how beautiful people make me sick. It's not that I'm bitter or jealous of the exceptionally genetically gifted. I just don't like them- sort of how I don't like pate. It's just gross to me, and I start to gag.  They look so happy. When I see happy, perky people in general, I want to put a pin to their head and let the air out. People probably say the same thing about me when I'm out and having a really good time with my friends, but I don't care really. To exercise my right to judge, I must be prepared for judgments upon me as well. (Though if I hear what someone says and it doesn't please me, a serious ass-whooping would be involved.)  I'm imagining there's a lot of happy people today. The California Supreme Court nullified all 4,000+ same sex marriages that took place this year in my fair city. That really bothers me. Gay marriage made so many people in this country unhappy. And now its remnants are being dismantled. All we'll have is a memory that gay people once had their love legally recognized by the city of San Fancisco, but no formal, substantitive documentation to prove it.  It just looks bad. A huge civil rights movement was just a flash in the pan. And now what? I'll have to endure ignorant assholes on the radio, in the news or in the elevator talking about how a wrong has been made right. I swear, for the next few days, when I hear people discuss gay marriage, I'll feel like I'm eating nothing but pate for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  And then the govenor of New Jersey resigned today because he had an extramarital affair with a man. I wonder if it occurred to the majority of people that maybe he wouldn't have been married to a woman in the first place if people were more accepting of homosexuality. What a mess bigotry creates.  Anyway, I'm done with my ranting for the day. Time for a nap before the tranny rock show tonight.  "
8004,4210703,"12,August,2004",2004-08-12,"   I should be getting to bed, but each time I stare back at my big empty thing, I keep thinking that there is so much I haven't done in the day, and that there is so much yet to do. And so if I were limited to one metaphor for my life, it would be an empty bed at night- a bed that should have my body's indentations, but doesn't. It doesn't even call for me. It sits there, like me- flat and demanding, but without specifically asking for attention, almost denying that it's asking for attention when it's really begging for it.  It sounds so dreary, the way I put things, but that's just how I am. I figure that if I live my pain loudly enough, one day it will do something. Maybe I'll reach someone who can make it stop. Maybe prettier words will come together and become something useful, like a story or book. To some extent I've put those thoughts behind me. But as I get older, and as I make decisions that lead me further away from my creative ambitions, I feel some need to reconnect with language and put these words online. It's like there's the spirit of a writer inside me who's slowly dying, and these are his last words- sort of like Ted Hughes' ode to Sylvia Plath. Hence the blog.  As I write, I feel disappointed with what's coming out. I wanted something cooler, more moving, more beautifully said, like what comes out during the rare moments I sit down at my computer or at a notepad and try to tell a story. The shocking thing about getting older for me is how useless the struggle for perfection really is. It's a losing battle I wish I never took up in the first place. But then I find myself joining in the fight at the most inopportune times no matter how much I try to let go of attaining perfection. Point is: I'll say lots of things on this here thingy. They can't all be epiphanies, tragedies, comedies, enlightening political insights, etc. It'll just be my life- my highly imperfect, flawed life that I don't enjoy as often as I should.  "
5642,4213470,"20,August,2004",2004-08-20,"   today rocked. life rocks. i'm feeling optimistic. i cant w8 for my geog test tmrw, amazing rite? i actually studied for it. well thats not excactly why i'm in a real gd mood... hehe. anyways hi, im the new me. no more vulgarities, no more stealing, no more breaking rulez. the old me's real interested 2 c how long i last. actually i'm interested 2... argh... im turning gay. yes that means i'm bcoming happy, as in gay=happy.  "
5643,4213470,"18,August,2004",2004-08-18,"   So today was our RE presentation, we had put in lots of effort and were all ready. The lights when out, we shined the spotlights on our presenter, the screen went down... then all of a sudden, the projector turned off (broke down) ! wonder of wonders... aft 6 succesful presentations the projector had decided to sabo us. Down to the main point, i think it was all dalai's fault. he used his jinx powers on us, his own group. But even without our slides, we continued. Though we actually cut more than 1/3 of the presentation and presented the rest rather jitterily. But the worst part was definitely that just after we concluded (as in literally, 2 seconds), the projector went on! *sigh* sadness rite? but wat is passed will never come back we arent goin to get another chance, so who cares. Anyway ferdi said to me that he liked our slides when he saw them later, so i guess it will be quite ok.  rite after that was hockey, bull had just found out about the shirts thing... so he screwed us. But i'm getting quite used to this kinda thing now, i even managed to find some humor in the way he was screwing us! i had to stifle my laughter ever so often. yeah, i guess i'm turning looney, yay!  "
5644,4213470,"17,August,2004",2004-08-17,"   A few dayz on and Iâ€™m losing interest in â€œmy blogâ€. Haha. School really sucked today, as usual. Anyway zhang mei suo was giving problem again. Its like he planned the test for next Thursday and told us like beginning of last week. Then today, he found out that we are going to be at a camp on Thursday and just changed it to Monday like â€œthatâ€. Its like no freaking time to study. And I need the time cos I take real long to study. Anyways that started me thinking again > my life is Â¼ over, and I havenâ€™t accomplished anything!!! And wat am I doing now??? Iâ€™m studying and putting myself through all the trouble of passing examsâ€¦ and that is useless to me. I wanna be a superstar roadsweeper! So what is the use of studying Chinese? Math? Science? Its just soo exasperating! I dun get to make my own choices, why cant I choose a roadsweeper course and spend my school life slacking like they do in austrailia??? In austrailia the first â€œgradedâ€ test is held when the kids are 18 years old! And that is obviously beneficial to the kidsâ€¦ take ri geps for example, the crÃ¨me de la crÃ¨me or what everâ€¦ of the singaporean students. They take so freaking many test, they are â€œsmartâ€ . But they are all so freaking weird, â€œvegetable brainsâ€ trained to memorize rubbish. Oh yah they are also so cocked up and all! And the moe doesnâ€™t see all this, cos they are made out of this kinda people too! So what do people with different aspirations do? ---- to be continued.  "
5645,4213470,"16,August,2004",2004-08-16,"   Man, I am in trouble again. The t-shirt stealing thing has only recently concluded and I appear once again on the wrong side of law. Mr koh is already really pissed with me, and now some one told him that I threatened aaron about some history test thingy!!! Thatâ€™s soo non-existent. I hope I can resolve this one quickly without getting into any further trouble. If u happen to be the one who told mr koh or maybe you told someone who could have told mr koh, please contact me cause you have made a mistake. Oh yah, if anyone knows who told mr chow about my selling food in class thing please contact me asap. I really wish ri boys had more integrity than this, if a class mate cannot put his trust in youâ€¦ who can?  "
5646,4213470,"13,August,2004",2004-08-13,"   This is my first blog and my first post and i'm doing it on friday 13th! How jinxed is that...  Anyway, today was our hockey third and fourth placing. So we were dismissed early and met in the canteen, most people werenâ€™t too serious, but i sure wasnâ€™t anyway... i'll tell you why later. anyways after warm up we got onto the pitch we played around for awhile. Finally the refs walked to the center of the pitch and the coin was tossed and stuff, the whistle blew. the game had begun, the first half was pretty uneventful though, i got a reverse chop which was on target, but sadly it flew out, besides that the game was pretty even. Second half i picked up my pace, making a few nice dribbles and centering the ball once, then toward the middle of the second half i dribbled past a defender into the D and got a short corner.i dragpushed the ball to chun men who stopped it smoothly and sent me a nice pass to the top D. i took a first timer... the ball hit the goalkeepers pads and went in with a resounding ""bang"". i was filled with joy, bursting with it perhaps, but this wasnâ€™t it, this was not how i used to feel when we won.  This was my first 3rd 4th placing ever, i had always had the good fortune of being in the finals. So why was that not the case this time round? Firstly, of the entire team of 19, 12 were sec1 and only 7 were sec2, in the first team of 11, 7 were sec1 and only 4 were sec2! for the last two years there have only been 1 or 2 sec1s in the first team! Iâ€™d like to congratulate all you sec1s though and I think you guyz played well, it wasnâ€™t your fault that we lost, it was your first major tournament and you guyz were visibly nervous, but it was not your fault. I feel that it was bulls fault. last year he neglected the sec1s causing many to drop out so we had to use many sec1s this year. So very frankly we were weak, people should not have expected us to win anything with our team, infact I was pretty amazed that we managed to make it this far. Iâ€™d like to point out that it hurts alot when people say ""you are the captain of the first hockey team in seven years to not take the championship title"". Hopefully after reading this you have realized that it was not my fault and that the team has actually done ""well"" I mean, next years team is going to be like really strongâ€¦ if you know Iâ€™m talking about you, feel regretful now. Cos I have given my f******g best and it is none of ur f******g buisness, beat it.  As I was saying the 3rd 4th did not matter much to me,  people only remember the best and the lousiest , so I feel that between 3rd and 4th, there is no diff.  "
29760,4213837,"16,August,2004",2004-08-16,"   Yo sup homie....  Today, i was ill and couldn't go to school... I told my classmates i got hit by a car and they actually believed it.... Lol so gullible... Anyhow, i gave my work to Kenneth so that he could hand them up to my teachers... Ms. Koh made me rewrite my essay outline just because i forgot to hand it in a week ago and left it in the history folder which i gave her... what an ass!!!  Also, went to the doctors around 4 and he gave me medicine... paid $20 just for a visit... what a rip-off.... i can write myself an excuse letter without having to pay $20!!! Oh yeah... or fencing coach is thinking about sending us to Malaysia for an international fencing competition... wonder if it'll push through...  Anyhow, i gtg do my work now... peace out ...  "
29761,4213837,"14,August,2004",2004-08-14,"   GRRR... the shit i do for people...  Anyhow, today's fencing competition was a disaster... We got a bronze... Yes, but a fatal error on my part gave us a bronze instead of a gold or silver.... out of the four members that joined, one was a reserve for every match.... Chow, Kit and I agreed that Ryan was to sit out for all the bouts we had, because he was the weakest of us all... So Ryan sat out the first and second bouts for the team event.... Taking pity on him, I let him fence the next one.... THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE! It was the first round of the Semi finals and Ryan screwed up... he was off form and he lost all the lead chow and kit got.... we ended up losing the Duxton Plane by 1 miserable point.... Chow and Kit were already yelling at me to get Ryan off the Piste and get back into my position but I thought that Ryan deserved a chance to fence.... We lost the match but went on to win the bronze in a deciding match where we made sure Ryan sat out...  Ryan felt bad after but i told him not to worry... but sometimes when u tell others not to feel bad about losing a match, u still feel angry inside... thats how i felt but i put on a mask and pretended to be ok with not winning a silver at least...  "
29762,4213837,"13,August,2004",2004-08-13,"   Yo waddup ya'll...  Ayt this is my second entry and i still wonder why I'm blogging... I'm talking to a GOD DAMED WHITE TEXT BOX!!! ARHGHGH!!!  So anyhow, fencing competition is tomorrow, and I'll be taking part in the team event along with Chow, Kit, and Ryan... One of us has to be in reserve but I don't know who... Personally, I think it should be Ryan... He's the shortest one of us all and Kit, Chow and I fence better than him... Anyhow, wish us luck for tomorrow...  Sometimes I wonder why i chose to come to CJC... I culda gone to Singapore American School... all I had to do was to make a call and pay the fees... But my mom heard stuff about SAS and she doesn't want me mixing with the people there... Sometimes she thinks too conservatively... Traditional Asian values... she's afraid that i might turn wild and crazy like back when I was in Manila.  But overall, I don't regret it... I got to meet all my friends inCJC... Thing is they're all humble but truly your friends... Kids in International schools tend to be more materialistic and aren't true friends... When you get in trouble, they disappear... Still, I sometimes miss hanging out with international kids... I miss being materialistic... I hardly have time or even bother to shop much anymore... I'm more comfortable around them... All the fun and excitement they bring opposed to the dull, more studious Singaporean kids... But still, I've no regrets in my current position although i miss being in the Philippines sometimes.  Oh yeah... mom bumped up my allowance to SG$100 a week now... the allowance includes me going out on weekends and eating in school, and it doesn't include school supplies... But I'll only bring 50 bucks to school a week, I'll save the other 50 every week... Gotta buy my brother a laptop for his Birthday next spring break... but then SG$50 a week ain't much... fine I'll starve for my brother.... The shit i do for people sometimes puzzles me...  ayt anyway, i gtg... peace... hope i kick ass tomorrow.  "
29763,4213837,"12,August,2004",2004-08-12,"   I was told that when you blog, you write what you would say to a close friend... So I'm staring at this white textbox, trying to imagine dear Jamey, my best friend whom i left behind in the Philippines. I'm pretty sure the last time i checked, Jamey looks way cuter than this...  So anyhow, a short intro, I'm Khai, Asian, 16 years of age and about 5'8 and 120lbs... Yeah i know, pretty small sized for a 16 year old... But still my mom thinks im good looking... Thats all that matters... hehe :P... And yes i'm a mama's boy... Parents like to spoil me and I LOVE IT! I now study in Catholic Junior College... Pretty good school in terms of acedemic standards, yet again it's sorta the cheapest and the most autocratic school I've been to. Feel as if I'm in communist North Korea, serving old uncle Kim Jong Il!  Anyhow, why am I blogging?! GOSH!!! My good American buddies in the Philippines were right! Coming to Singapore will make me gay like all the other people here... WEll, let's not be to harsh, I'm sure there are some straight people around. So anyway, I agree, Singapore's a bitch... NO GUM?! U GOTTA BE SHITTING ME!!! BTW, cars drive on the wrong side of the road here and i got hit by a taxi while crossing a T-junction when i first got here in January. So life has turned upside down for me. Local people think I'm wierd, and I think their wierd too... But still, in life, you expect changes and you gotta go with the flow... so i cut a deal with a few classmates of mine that by December, I'll start speaking wierd like Singapoerans.... NO LAH! WAH LAO EH! You know, slang terms like that... Ain't that shit cool... And when I go on my vacation with Jamey in New Zealand next year, she's gonna start wondering WTF happened to me... btw, Jamey's from North Carolina... like me, we were expats in the Philippines.  Ayt, enough for today... i gotta go... peace... BYE LAH!!  "
21783,4213897,"20,August,2004",2004-08-20,"   Hello there I,     it's friday again!!!   i get to take my daughter to work today (she's 12 & she can take care of herself while i'm working...so, no problema...), also my boss is not in, the other big cheese is on vacation &amp; it's casual day too!  we get to hang out in the city after work ( which is an early day for me...i'm off by 4pm) so what better way to spend this day but with my daughter?!  Moms gotta get a break too once in a while, of course Dads too should be allowed to take their kids (not toddlers of course or babies unless the company offers back-up daycare, which is great)...We just don't get enough time to spend w/ our kids when we work full-time in an ofc., the weekends are just too short!, & before we know it they're off to high school &amp; dating & have no more time to spend w/ their cornball parents...boo hoo....anyway, if i can find a home-based business or some part-time career...that would be ideal!     anway, my daughter is rushing me...not nice), just wanted to jot down some of my to-do today:          1) try to work till about 3:30 or 4pm...keep my girl busy, she's gotta get on this computer & play some games.     2) after work, go to Chi-town - my daughter wants to go get a hair-styling/trim of her long, long hair.     3)  whle in Chi-town - get some dimsum snacks & bubble tea maybe.  buy some goodies for the folks at home...     4) go home, & hang-out w/ my little boy & my hubby.          (& the start of the weekend)  hooray!          ok, that's it, gotta sign off...guess what song is playing right this very second....     my fave - JT's ""Fire & Rain""  -      (? could the day be moreperfect than this???)     ....""thought i'd see U one more time again?  JT asks, & i agree...i know i will see U one more time again...at least before my life expires (wow, here's the drama queen again :)          till then,  au revoir mon amour, "
21784,4213897,"18,August,2004",2004-08-18,"   Good Morning I,     not much to say today. just been thinking that i should change my blog title...i mean if i were to write a book i wouldn't call it - ""& the journey continues..."", it's too cliche, over-used &amp; beaten down the road littered with wanna-ba-writers hung-over w/ their own self-worth & obsessive thoughts...oops, not referring to me of course. so, i was debating what is a perfect title for this journal>>>          1) my secret love affair (sounds great &amp; mysterious but corny at the same time...)     2) ""Truth is stranger than fiction"" - but this has been used a million times!     3) Who Am I? - is good, but too existentialist for those ordinary day--to-day musings...     4) ""raison-d'etre"" - cool, but i'm not even French!     5) voices in my head - this has a certain ring to it...i kinda like it, but now for the next step...          So, it's just one of those boring days, we all have lots of those...     not much to rant & rave about, &amp; too tired to really try...i'll just take it easy today.     too early in the morning to be tired already!     well, here's one good thing, this little song playing in my head this morning was:     ""Honey Pie"" by the Beatles ( & a cover done by Tuck &amp; Patti which is great too!)     ...i love this song, for those cloudy,gloomy days...it's sure to pick u up.     ...anyway, here goes: ""honey pie, u are driving me crazy, i'm in love but i'm lazy...     la, la,la, la ...la, honey pie, my position is tragic...i'm in love but it's ....""     ( i don't know all the lyrics...sorry).     but the melody & the rhythym sure is good...     so till then,       happy singing ,      now it's 5:10 pm (NY time)     i just changed my blog title to :  voices in my head....  ( not the most original i know, but   somehow this resonates more for me right now...i'm sure i could change it again later on, during the many more blogs, months &amp; months later...) ohh, i forgot another good one, ""talking to myself"" or ""writing for herself"" (but that's not in 1st person, which I AM.) this is so great, i don't feel lonely & alone knowing so many people out there are also blogging their funny tragic life stories...     life is amazingly simple &amp; complex at the same time...     well till the next blog, SEE Y'All. "
21785,4213897,"17,August,2004",2004-08-17,"   good morning I, sometimes i think only my kids ""get"" me. nobody else in the world can get me all the time. my 12 yr old girl knows exactly when i'm getting grumpy before i even recognize it myself...(talk abt an early warning device!) she's great that way...she goes: ""Mom, why are u grumpy?"" & i yell back ""No, i'm not!, i'm just...Wow, ur right, i am a little pissed off...&amp; then i stop & think..."" so she's wonderful to have around. &amp; then my little one, has a way of melting my heart. never fails. whatever mood i'm in, he heightens it into a positive note...every morning, before i leave for work i have to kiss him & greet him a beautiful morning even tho. he's still sleeping...just looking at his face makes my day. but on the weekends, forgedaboudit! he becomes some kind of a little dictator around the house...yelling orders like: ""I want cartoons!"", "" I want ma-mam &amp; i want ma-mam now!"", or ""Mommy, let's play!! U be this soldier, & i be that""....""or U be Rocky &amp; i be Billy! (from his Rescue Heroes)....& wakes up the whole house to serve him...&amp; now that he's potty trained, he goes to the toilet by himself like a big guy, my swashbuckling cowboy/soldier...I got him allright. i really should count my blessings...at least there's 2 people in the world who can totally take me for who i am...not even my husband can get me.   ...u know those moments when ur only trying to communicate something & all these other stuff come up, &amp; u just wanna give up & shut down...my husband doesn't get that all i'm saying is:    ""can u pls. understand me thru all this confusion?"" instead of judging me...asking why, & bringing back what was said &amp; done before...saying stuff like, ""don't be starting something again..."" when i'm not trying to start anything really, just reaching out...can U hear me?      that's why, God blessed me with these two very intuitive & sensitive kids who know me before i even say anything...they GOT what it is i'm trying to say or make happen, &amp; when something is not happening, they also know there is something missing...& it melts my heart every time one of them asks me: ""why are u mad Mommy?"", &amp; both of us get stopped on our one sided-track ( a train wreck waiting to happen) & we go, ""no baby, Mom &amp; Daddy are just talking..."" or some lame excuse... ""trying to have a conversation...""  & we become quiet, lost in our own train of thoughts.  that kinda summarizes our 5-year marriage...still trying to have a conversation...a real conversation.   ...hmm, what brought this up? i don't know, just missing my kids during some free time at work.  i'm so pathetic!      but hey, i don't want to dampen anybody's day that's turning out to be sunny &amp; gorgeous after all...despite the weather forecast,   so, ""keeping on the sunny side""...   till then, "
21786,4213897,"16,August,2004",2004-08-16,"   it's too early in the week to be daydreaming i know, i usually reserve these for night time solitude...      but, like i always say, what else can i do? (it beats sitting here & staring at a blank screen w/ the blinking cursor... ) what do i daydream the most about?....Hmmm, that's easy... ...i always imagine that ""ideal love"", that ""ideal man"" that i've never met, or maybe... bumped into once in my life...but just don't have the courage to rearrange my whole life for...to see, if perhaps, he truly is the One...if there ever is a One?... well, not to be cynical, i do believe there is a One, a soulmate, but that there are also ""soul-mates"" in one's lifetime...your best friends, your EX-es, your kids, your family, your soul-group...&amp; depending on the Karma that you need to relive and reinvent...you either are blessed to be with that soulmate or doomed to walk this earth like a heart without a proper home...     ... i know, i'm really vague when it comes to matters of the heart...that's my weakness, my ""achilles' heel"", that's where i go giberrish... did u see that movie ""Troy"" ( i mean, it's hollywoodized of course) but, the most touching scene for me was, the last moments of Achilles when he realized his true love, & ready to defend his loved one to the death, ready to change into a less bitter man...but as fate would have it, the prince Paris shot an arrow to his heel not knowing he was on their side... that became his downfall...the most celebrated warrior of that time... It's a tragedy of course, like most Greek myths...but it makes me think... what if?     what if, by my own undoing, because i am so jaded about relationships...&amp; because i still don't know what that ""ideal relationship"" is...ok, so there's no ideal relationship, u gotta keep working on it...well,     what if there is one...where it is less work because you are the perfect match, like peas in a pod...like the Yin to your Yang & vice versa... so, here i go believing in my heart that there is a possibility of finding that true love that is complete...without too much trying...it's just there... it just IS, and how do U know for sure?      for no reason but, that u feel it most when you're together...&amp; even when apart...it's just there....       (sigh) but like the jaded Achilles, i might be walking around, one of the many wounded (by war of the hearts)...like a lost soul searching for its harbor...seeing a vague vision of a lighthouse from a distance, far-away from her reality...but visible through a fog...what if? that light is what's real, & this reality that can crush the spirit from life sometimes, is what is not...because it is something that i have fabricated from all the mis-steps, like a mistake built on top of a mistake, to cover-up the fact that i might have made a bigger mistake?! oh God, how does one get out of that one?! (read to the tune from Rolling Stones ""Paint It Black"")...          trying to make right what's wrong... or trying to right a wrong from a negative place??...it only works in Mathematics right?... 2 negatives equals a positive?...but 2 positives is even better!... i hate dichotomies!      it doesn't have to be so black &amp; white...      well, that's the sort of daydreaming that i find myself getting lost in once in a while...not too often of course...or i will be walking towards the deep end again my friend...&amp; no, i'm not gonna go there...          till then... still dreaming, "
21787,4213897,"13,August,2004",2004-08-13,"   good morning I, it's rainy again in NYC, i was falling asleep in my commute...nice relaxing ferry ride is always better than the packed-like-sardines-subway. it just takes a little more time...time enough to read a book, read ur newspaper, or as for me this morning, just thinking of nothing (for a change) & just dozing off to the sight of the waves. ...someone once told me that he always pictures me close to the water, maybe i look like a mermaid? (or perhaps sing like one, i wish?!) ...well i am from the islands, my earliest memories of weekends with my family were always spent picnicking on sandy beaches...i'm sure if i had enough money, i wud live by the water...a little beach cottage &amp; i wud be really happy :)  well, how was my weekend? it was good.  i did a lot of my things-to-do, shopped for back-to-school clothes & supplies for my daughter, went to a children's party on sunday (lots of family &amp; food), did my laundry, cleaned around the house a little, watched some Olympic games, what else...cooked a little, that's about it... & now it's back to monday, rainy from the remnants of Hurrican Charley &amp; Bonnie from the South...  i think i'll take it slow today...what else can i do? it's really great when i can have lots of time to think, & not stress out. that's why i ""opted out"" from a corporate to a non-profit job i guess. my real reason was just to spend more time &amp; energy with what's important to me more than my job - my Self, my family... & around that time i got pregnant with my second child &amp; got married again- all when i was just starting out here on this job...also working here makes me feel good - the knowing that i can contribute in my own small way to making a difference in people's lives...those in need.  but my next goal is to make a more direct connection to making a difference - a career where i can really see & experience firsthand how i can help people, i wanna focus more on children...cause when i'm around kids, my own &amp; other little munchkins, i get so much JOY & working with them will not feel like work at all.  So, my goal is to change careers, maybe become an early education teacher, or special ed. (which i hear is very challenging) or maybe become a school counselor...i have lots of experience in dealing with troubled kids - starting w/ my self, then my hubby & all my other Ex-es! so, i'll take it step by step, &amp; hopefully one day, i will be writing here &amp; logging in about my days in school...  for now, here in the school of life... one baby step at a time, "
21788,4213897,"13,August,2004",2004-08-13,"   good morning I, good morning All...after i checked my work emails this is the first thing i opened...i think this could definitely grow on me like a bad habit. (not that my boss will mind, at least it makes it seem like i'm so busy & serious on some project)...anyway, today i felt like treating myself so i got my favorite starbucks coffee grande w/ soy &amp; the marble loaf! Hmm, & as i'm enjoying it, i meditate on what's new today...   well, aside from noting that it is friday - whoopee!, the 13th! no big deal, i don't believe in superstitions...the conversations i had w/ some regular folks on the bus &amp; ferry seemed to revolve around the next President (hopefully!) John Kerry...also where we'll be during the coming dreaded Republican convention here in our city...why of all places did they have to pick NY?! i mean haven't we gone thru enough already?! after 9-11, the deadly SI Ferry crash, the sudden unemployments, the Bloombergization, FOX 5 biased news (thank God i hardly watch that news, i'm an NBC fan)... It's no wonder why I along w/ a lot of other working parents i get a chance to speak w/ are considering packing our bags & taking the U-Haul to search for a new life...a better life from here? who knows. only time will tell. my brother lives down south (of Georgia) &amp; so is my hubby's sister's family so...at least there's equal representation from both families there. If push comes to shove, there's always some place to run to.   but as i was saying, i'm glad that there is a renewed interest in this voting process...but we still talk abt. the bitterness after all that confusion & whatever-happened-to-the-Florida-votes?...maybe people have grown cynical? ...Maybe. but after 4 years of nothing &amp; this stupid purported Iraq war!, maybe people are at the point of vomitting...enough is enough.    i know they're talking abt the politics of ""hope"" but if that's the only thing left to keep working class folks such as me going, feeling like maybe a change is gonna come...well then i am all for HOPE...   i always remember where hope came from, especially for me as a kid growing up w/ a lot of ""family drama"", bitter images of 2 loving parents going thru their own crises, staging their tragic-comedies not realizing the little ones ( the formative not so little teeny sons & daughter) had to sit at home &amp; witness this passion play...while at the same time trying to stay sane & make the grade in school...well, u know what i mean....   ...I always turned to that greek mythology about Pandora's box, where all sorts of evils &amp; monsters have been opened & released to the world....yikes, kinda reminds me of where WE are right now in our times...look at all the funny evil stuff shown in the movies...(i just can't be bothered watching horror flicks anymore...why raise my adrenaline for that??) ...anyway, what remained in that box, waiting to come out &amp; redeem what's lost, what's forgotten...the last thing that remained in that box, the only thing that could give back Love & Peace to people is HOPE...   so, whatever they wanna call it, Politics of Hope, ""Help is on the Way""... well i'd rather believe in something good...that there is still some inherent goodness in all of us, &amp; that we will go out there to cast our vote for Hope - John & John, isn't that something? it's almost a sign...they have got to win this time. I don't care anymore whatever vile (which when scrambled up - comes out w/ the word evil)...stuff i hear in this coming republican convention...i just hope it's not gonna be violent around here...hey this is my city too, u know, i live &amp; work here....what about us little folks?! pls. don't cause more trouble than what we've been through...we have families to support too u know.   anyway, there was even 1 older guy on the bus, who listened to the Democratic convention &amp; liked what he heard....who used to be a republican, w/ a son in the Navy or something like that...who thinks that this time he will swing more towards becoming a democrat...Well, that is hopeful.   ...maybe a change is brewing, a good brew just like my coffee...hmmm,   till then, happy trails,   :) "

10221,4216034,"12,August,2004",2004-08-12,"    Faulty ignition prompts major Volkswagen, Audi recall    AUBURN HILLS, Mich., Feb. 4, 2003  Some 530,000 2001 to early 2003 Volkswagen and Audis have been recalled because of potentially defective ignition coils that could lead to a partial loss of engine power, according to the automakers. The recall includes the Audi TT and A4, Volkswagen Golf/GTI, Jetta, New Beetle, and Passat--all with 1.8-liter engines. The recall also extends to the Passat with W8 engine, all Volkswagens with the 2.8-liter VR6, and all cars with an Audi 3.0-liter V6. The majority of affected vehicles are 2001 and 2002 models. Only about 36,000 2003 vehicles are involved. The 2.8-liter V6 Passat is not affected by this recall. Gerd Klauss, president and chief executive officer of Volkswagen of America, said in a statement that ""some ignition coils are not up to our high quality standards"" and that the automaker intends to fix ""every single car with these coils by replacing them whether they are broken yet or not."" Ignition coils provide electricity to the spark plugs. Through dealer service reports, the automakers noticed that the coils in the suspect vehicles were failing at a higher-than-normal rate. If a coil fails, the ""check-engine"" light will blink and the car's performance may become rough, possibly to the point of losing some power. Neither Volkswagen nor the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration consider the coil failure to be a safety issue. VW says that roadside assistance is available for anyone who does not feel comfortable driving with a car that has a failed ignition coil. Letters went out to consumers at the end of January 2003 notifying them of the problem, Volkswagen spokesman Steve Keyes said. Car owners should make an appointment with their dealer. At present, VW is giving priority to those who have had an ignition-coil failure: broken coils will be replaced immediately. If the car has suffered a second failure, all the coils will be replaced. By March 2003, VW expects to be able to replace all ignition coils on a car if only one has failed. In order to minimize inconvenience, Volkswagen and Audi dealers will offer alternative transportation at no cost while repairs are made, the company says.  For more information call Volkswagen at 800-822-8987 or Audi at 800-822-2834.   "

6238,4216577,"12,August,2004",2004-08-12,"    What a weekend!  If any of you have never been to Manitoulin Island, the long weekend in August every year is a great time to visit!  This year, we decided to be a part of the festivities and become vendors.  What an adventure it was! This is an outdoor event by the way.  The first day we set up outside of the Rec Centre in Little Current on a small grass walkway between the drive and the parking lot.  (it was about 9am for me)It turned out to be a great location becuase we REALLY needed the tree that we set up under.  The day was overcast, threatening to break out in a heck of a storm.  Across from us was a clothing vendor and his family who were a great help when my tent refused to go up on its own.  (Its really wonderful to meet such great folks!)  I had a great lady set up beside me (Rayvin from Eclectic Enchantments here in Sudbury) and the two of us rode the bad weather together.  Luckily she brought tarps which were much needed when the storm finally broke through the gray sky and we got dumped on.  But it was a blast! I was selling while holding onto the frame of the tent while the wind DROVE through everything, pieces flying across the grass... some quite far! All you could do was laugh and enjoy the great company of the people who came to our tents supporting our business.  (Thanks!)  The weather finally drove us to close up shop as it was tearing down larger tents beside us and causing a heck of a mess.  But it was a great day!  The next morning I set up quite early on the main street downtown in Little Current.  I had a fabulous view right onto the walkway of the docks looking at the North Channel.  At 8am the temperature had already hit 28 degrees C.  HOT! And no wind!  I brought extra stones with me for the base of my tent just in case!  The main street was blocked off, so we had to unpack our vehicles and move them.  The heat continued to build and so did the energy of the day!  Right on the street, we had the perfect view of the parade going by and later in the evening the fireworks that went off on the shore across from the walkway.  I'd like to thank EVERYONE who attended the festival and came to my booth for making this show a fabulous success for us!   The streets were jammed with people and I was lucky to be beside a great food vendor that made the most fabulous home made breads and fried bologne! YUM!   By 7pm I was feeling pretty tired.... my family was meeting in Little Current for a dinner and they were sweet to bring me a plate to munch on - Thanks!! A big thankyou to my cousin Peggy, who hosted the dinner (I did not get to thank her properly as I was extremly busy when she showed up)  The night continued on and finally around 11pm we had to close up shop as the fireworks were about to start.    My mom and daughter helped me to unfold our travelling show quickly so that we could get our cars over the swing bridge before the crowds started to head out.  For anyone who has not been to Manitoulin Island - it IS an island and the only way on is via a one lane swing bridge OR the ferry on the south side.   We folded up the shop and headed out over the bridge and STILL had a lot of time to sit on the back of the truck watching the beautiful lights in the sky.  I'll be there again next year!! Raven   "
6239,4216577,"12,August,2004",2004-08-12,"    Hi!  You know, sometimes being a vendor in Canada is not easy. I've been looking for a good e-commerce solution so that I can sell in both currencies (US and CA)... Right now I am using a really great service provider that I'm really satisfied but I can only sell in US dollars..  If you find something you really like on our site and you are from Canada, for now you can give me a call (or email) and we'll work out the price and I can ship your item to you. (All the contact info is on our webpage)  I'm hoping that by mid September this year I'll be able to offer Canadian prices but I wont make any promices until I work all the bugs out.  Anyways, I'm off to make some more creations.. right now the stock is low on the site since we had a fabulous time at Haweater weekend. Maybe I'll post about that later on.  Raven   "

20352,4218355,"21,August,2004",2004-08-21,"   On Thursday, I made a  urlLink Summer Pudding .  It's a simple thing; just a pudding basin lined with bread, filled with a quick fruit/sugar compote.  (I have linked to the Delia Smith recipe, as mine only differed fractionally.  I made a 1 1/2 quart pudding, whereas she does a 1 1/2 pint one, plus I used 1lb blackberries, 12oz redcurrants, and 8oz strawberries, rather than her fruit choices.  A little more sugar, and bread too to cope with the larger quantities.)  Now this is a traditional refreshing summer treat, quite tart, but lovely and sweet too, made by many people all over the country.  However, I would not attempt this if the fruit did not come from the garden, for one reason.   Cost.   What is up with supermarket prices for berries??  Strawberries aren't too bad, a 1lb punnet cost me Â£1.80, mind you that was 1/2 price.  But redcurrants, and more over, blackberries and raspberries are ever so dear.   120g of Blackberries, ie. 1/4 lb, costs Â£2!  Redcurrants are about the same.  At that rate my pudding would've had Â£8 worth of blackberries, Â£6 worth of redcurrants, and Â£1.80 of strawberries....  That's  Â£16 , before you've added the sugar and bread!!  Alright, my pudding was rather large, and would probably serve 10, but even so....  Those fruits aren't  that  hard to cultivate, I think the problem must lie in keeping them fresh.  Their shelf life isn't fantastic.  I suppose you could buy frozen berries, you can get a mixerd summer fruit 1lb bag for ~Â£2, 2 of those with a couple of peaches thrown in would work, and cost about Â£5.  But the fruit needs to be fresh really...  Oh well, I hope Britains home gardeners keep up the good work, otherwise these sort of traditional treats are going to be priced out of reach...  "
20353,4218355,"15,August,2004",2004-08-15,"   Well my brother and I love mexican food, as does his girlfriend.  Now they are both devilish meateaters, :(, and regularly have burritos when they live away, but rather obviously make them non-vegan.  So I decided to try doing them as close to how my brother likes them, but vegan.  Surprisingly, it was exceptionally simple; no modifications hardly at all.  And guess what, my brother and his girlfriend like the vegemince and bean ones better than their normal ones.  They don't buy meat mince anymore. :D  pack of tortilla wraps (vegan -  urlLink Sainsburys own-brand  are) pot of salsa - make sure it's vegan, or make your own. 250g  urlLink RealEat Vegemince  350ml hot water fajita seasoning packet -  urlLink Discovery  brand is vegan by the look of it,  urlLink Schwartz  is as well. tin of red kidney beans 2 bell peppers - or mixed peppers to roughly that amount, small/medium strips 1 medium onion, finely chopped oil (optional) lettuce, shredded (optional) vegan  urlLink mayonnaise / urlLink sour cream   Get a large deep frying pan, chop the onions finely, and the peppers in to small/medium strips - fry them for a little while.  When the onions/peppers are semi-soft, add the mince and the fajita seasoning and toss the mixture together.  Add the water and mix well (some packet seasonings absorb water and need their own, add extra if this is the case).  Drain and wash the beans and add them to the mix.  Cook for about 10 minutes, or until there is no liquid left, but the mixture is still moist.  Warm up the tortillas in a microwave or under a grill for a short time, I find 3 together on a plate take about 30 seconds, don't do too many at once as they will all stick together.  Lay out tortillas, imagine the tortilla as being divided in to 5 equal width strips.  If you number these strips from left to right, 1 to 5, we leave 1 empty, put lettuce in strip 2, put the mince mixture in strip 3 (more mince than lettuce), put salsa in strip 4 (not too much, as too much liquid will make it fall apart), and then put a little mayo on strip 5 to help seal it.  Once you've put all the fillings in, just roll it up, and tuck the bottom end inside. Voila!  NB. Do not put any thing too close to the edge, and don't overfill, or you won't be able to roll them up, and they won't stay like that if you do.  If you can't get Vegemince, which is the best in my opinion, then you could use soya mince, or even skip the mince, and replace the beans with a couple of tins of refried beans (check to make sure they're vegan).  Fajita seasoning often has some sort of milk fixer in it, like so many powdered things.  You can make your own, if you reckon you can judge the quantities you like.  They tend to be primarily: salt, chilli, paprika, onion powder, garlic powder, cayenne pepper, ground coriander, oregano, lemon/lime juice, cinnamon (hardly any) and a few other bits and pieces.  "
20354,4218355,"13,August,2004",2004-08-13,"   weed , n.    (a) A plant considered undesirable, unattractive, or troublesome, especially one growing where it is not wanted, as in a garden. (b) Rank growth of such plants.   Something useless, detrimental, or worthless.   Brambles are always referred to as weeds, as they are prolific over most of England at least, and have rampant growth, spreading out to all corners.  This description would hold with parts of the defintion of a weed (growing where it is not wanted, rank growth), and because brambles are covered in thorns, you could add troublesome.  However, I have always thought that the most important part of a definition of a weed, is the ""useless, [and] detrimental"" parts.  How can a plant that produces the most delicious fruit you can find be 'useless', or 'detrimental' for that matter.  They also look lovely at this time of year when they are in fruit.  The thorns may be an issue, but if I were a plant that produced such wonderful fruit, I'd protect it too.  My nan has a thicket of brambles in her back garden, and she wants them all removed, as they are weeds. :(  I have been trying to show her that they are great, by picking a fair portion of the blackberries from them every week.  Then making some puddings from them.  To start off with I've tried making a basic apple & blackberry filling, and using it to make a crumble and a pie.  To make the apple &amp; blackberry filling, I used the following.  8-10 oz blackberries (checked, and washed) 1lb 10oz cooking apples (peeled, then thinly sliced) 4 tbsp caster sugar 2 tbsp water 3 tsp arrowroot  Just dissolve the sugar in the water in a saucepan, add the apple slices, and cook down for a few minutes, then before the apples are very soft, add the blackberries, mash some of the blackberries down a bit.  Then add some arrowroot to thicken, stirring in.  Add more sugar if you need it, or more arrowroot if there is too much liquid.  (NB. Don't allow the apples to brown much, I put the apples in to the sugar solution as I cut them, this halts the browning a bit.  If not, put a tbsp of lemon juice in a bowl and toss the apple in it as you cut.  Then I just put the mixture in to a pie (using basic sweetemed shortcrust pastry) or in to a dish and cover with crumble topping (8oz plain flour, 5oz soft light brown sugar, 2oz butter (or substitute)).  Delicious they were!  If I get enough fruit at some point I might make some blackberry jam.  So brambles, they  are not  weeds, they are a great provider.  Nature loves them too, on my nan's patch there were ladybirds, wasps, hoverflies, leaf shieldbugs, spiders, flies, mites, even a frog had come! :)  "
20355,4218355,"13,August,2004",2004-08-13,"   Until this week, I have never been to the cinema alone. Sad thing to do I always reasoned, after all, the cinema and films are a social thing, something you do with friends. I could not understand how some of my mates managed to go and see films on their own without feeling awkward.  This has changed...slightly. :S  Recently, I purchased an "" urlLink Unlimited Card "", which is a subscription service for the cinema I use. Â£10/month for unlimited viewings. I've had it for 2 weeks, and have seen 4 films so far, IIRC.  Now as I am a bum, and have lots of free time, thankfully free as I wouldn't be able to afford it if it cost me anything, I could spend my time at the cinema. However, lots of my friends don't have the card, and couldn't afford to go often. Besides, many of my mates have jobs, some people do apparently, and can't get the time to see some stuff. But I want to see things! Lots of things!  The last problem is my taste. I like many films, not a huge fan of serious realistic films, often described as ""gritty"", but I like the rest. This particularly includes ""kids"" films. Now last time I looked the age certificate for a film was a lower bound, not an upper.... Why does everyone grow out of good stuff? Mad people.  So I bit the bullet and went to see  urlLink Garfield The Movie  on Wednesday, and  urlLink Home On The Range  this afternoon (Thursday).  So I sat in my usual seat, on my own, looking like a pillock, but that's normal, amongst a cacophony of parents and little kids (the schools are all on holiday), and... enjoyed the show.  It was a bit awkward, but I wouldn't have got to see them if I didn't go by myself. So unless I get friends that actually share any of my interests anytime soon this might become a regular feature. Tons of films to see this month after all!  "

8157,4220994,"17,August,2004",2004-08-17,"   Another day goes by, life deals out more crap and I am sick and tired of it! Well at least I am more normal then this lady: urlLink http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~author/ . Not that I am in any position to judge anybody else. But I do think that believing Garth Brooks is your past lover is a little strange. I don't think I believe in reincarnation, but who really knows what lies beyond our earthbound selves. As a matter of fact if reincarnation is true, I don't want to know it. To know that everything I have experienced, every lesson I have learned, every emotion I feel will be washed away into a new life is heartbreaking. I want to keep my memories, all the little ""life moments"" I have tucked away inside me. And forget me ever being excited about doing this whole life thing over again. Once is tiring enough! I do not even pretend to know what is on the ""other side"" but I believe it is better then here and now. Do you believe in reincarnation? "
8158,4220994,"16,August,2004",2004-08-16,"   As a nurse, I am faced with death or dying at least weekly. This closeness to death has always made me curious to what death brings. I won't get into any religous beleifs here, but I will say that the study of death (thanatology) intrigues me. I have always felt like I can  feel  death. I am on this depressing subject because of an  experience today. On the way to work I passed a very bad accident, I felt death all around me. I have felt anxious since then. Living in a small town word of mouth travels faster then the newspaper has chance to report it, and I heard that the man in one truck did die. Which has contributed to my uneasiness that I have felt since passing the accident. I often brush off the ""feeling of death"" and tell myself that I am nuts, but hearing that there was a death makes me uncomfortable with knowing that maybe I did  feel  it. It reminded me of that scene in The Sixth Sense, where the boy and the mom are behind traffic at a car accident and the little boy says, ""mom someone died in the accident"" and the mother asks him why he says that and he says ""she is standing by the window"". ok now that I have myself all freaked out and all of you out there telling yourselves how much of a freak I am, here is something kinda funny.

8160,4220994,"13,August,2004",2004-08-13,"   After many frustrating hours of being ready to throw the laptop out of the window, I finally got my site working with CSS. I love how CSS makes everything so clean and prevents all the extra typing of tables.   Two more days and my little brother leaves for college. I can't believe he is old enough to go off to college. I know I will miss him terrible. From the time he was very little I have always mothered him and spoiled him. So now he is going to run off into the big scary world without me to protect him. It is depressing. I will cry I am sure :0)  Which brings me to my next rant. I overheard someone tell someone else, ""Well my mother always told me that happiness doesn't come to you, you have to go out and find your own happiness."" Now exactly what moron finds this to be great wisdom? Where exactly is this happiness lurking that one can go find it? I would like to know. As a long time sufferer of major depression I am going to be pissed if all along I could have went and found happiness lurking under a bush somewhere. What do you think, can you just go out and find happiness?? (and yes I know this is just a figure of speech, just wondered if anybody else found it as absurd as me) "

25294,4221834,"19,August,2004",2004-08-19,"   For  SKY :        INSTALLING LOVE  Tech Support: Yes Ma'am... how can I help you? Customer: Well, after much consideration, I've decided to install Love. Can you guide me though the process? Tech Support: Yes. I can help you. Are you ready to proceed? Customer: Well, I'm not very technical, but I think I'm ready. What do I do first? Tech Support:  The first step is to open your Heart . Have you located your Heart ma'am? Customer: Yes, but there are several other programs running now. Is it okay to install Love while they are running? Tech Support: What programs are running ma'am? Customer: Let's see, I have  Past/Hurt,  Low Self-Esteem, Grudge and Resentment running right now. Tech Support: No problem,  Love will gradually erase Past/Hurt  from your current operating system. It may remain in your permanent memory, but it will no longer disrupt other programs. Love will eventually override Low Self-Esteem with a module of it's own called High Self-Esteem. However, you have to completely turn off Grudge and Resentment. Those programs prevent Love from being properly installed. Can you turn those off ma'am? Customer: I don't know how to turn them off. Can you tell me how? Tech Support: With pleasure. Go to your start menu and invoke Forgiveness. Do this as many times as necessary until Grudge and Resentment have completely erased. Customer: Okay, done! Love has started installing itself. Is that normal? Tech Support: Yes, but remember that you have only the base program. You need to begin connecting to other Hearts in order to get the upgrades. Customer: Oops! I have an error message already. It says, ""Error - program not run on external components."" What should I do? Tech Support: Don't worry ma'am. It means that the Love program is set up to run on Internal Hearts, but has not yet been run on your Heart. In non-technical terms, it simply means you have to Love yourself before you can Love others. Customer: So, what should I do? Tech Support: Can you pull down Self-Acceptance; then click on the following files: Forgive-Self; Realize Your Worth; and Acknowledge your Limitations. Customer: Okay, done. Tech Support: Now, copy them to the ""My Heart"" directory. The system will overwrite any conflicting files and begin patching faulty programming. Also, you need to delete Verbose Self-Criticism from all directories and empty your Recycle Bin to make sure it is completely gone and never comes back. Customer: Got it. Hey!!! My heart is filling up with new files.      Smile is playing on my monitor and Peace and Contentment are copying themselves all over My Heart. Is this normal? Tech Support: Sometimes. For others it takes awhile, but eventually everything gets it at the proper time. So Love is installed and running. One more thing before we hang up. Love is Freeware. Be sure to give it and its various modules to everyone you meet. They will in turn share it with others and return some cool modules back to you. Customer: I promise to do just that. By the way, what's your name? Tech Support: Just call me the Divine Cardiologist, also known as the Great Physician, or, just ""I AM."" Most people feel all they need is an annual checkup to stay heart-healthy; but, the manufacturer (ME) suggests a daily maintenance schedule for maximum Love efficiency. "

21507,4224651,"18,August,2004",2004-08-18,"   After a few months had gone by, and the dead of winter was now upon us, it was time for my father to fire up the coal stove and generate a little heat for us old-school New Englanders. The reason for the coal stove was that Dad never believed in electric heat because it was too expensive so he hired a service to come deliver loads of coal about 2-3 times throughout the season. It was effective enough, I suppose. Dirty, because one would have to shovel coal into the stove and afterwards, remove the ashes left by the coal that had already burned, but still effective. My father's only rule was this: ""Nobody shovels coal into the stove but me. If you're cold at night, take out another blanket from the closet and put it on."" Needless to say, we spent many a cold night at Chez Loubier. But none so cold as the nights spent during that winter.  My mother had placed the candlesticks she got from that tag sale on the mantel above the coal stove. Sometimes she'd take them down to burn a candle or two, but mainly they were put there for the ""ambiance,"" as Mom liked to say. I really don't think the ambiance she got was the kind of ambiance she intended to achieve. I think it started one night in December of '84. And it scared the hell out of us. "
21508,4224651,"13,August,2004",2004-08-13,"   So we get to this tag sale, and there's about 40 people walking through and around makeshift rows of shit left by the person who lives in the filthiest-looking house I think I've ever seen. The yard looked like it hadn't been mowed this century, the brown paint was flaking and peeling off of the front of the house. There was a maroon-colored car parked in the driveway (had to be a Datsun) and one next to it camping out on the grass (probably another Datsun). All around me I saw what to me looked like junk. A couch, an old bookcase, a rusty table with four equally rusty chairs, picture frames, a lava lamp (if you can believe that). There was some old pottery pieces that looked as if they had to be from the early 1900s. But in the end, it was the silver candlesticks that caught Mom's eyes. Not too much longer after we had gotten there, my mother spotted two identical candlesticks. Very antique. She was in to that kind of stuff. She liked the whole old-fashioned, rustic look about certain things. She was in the middle of a very intense examination of said candlesticks when the old woman walked over.  ""You like them?"" she asked. My mother was a bit easy to startle so the question made her jump a little. The old lady was short and walked with a cane. Her shoes looked like the kind you wear when you're in a hospital and her dress resembled those smocks you used to wear in 5th grade art class. Those smocks sucked. I hated those friggen things.  ""They're beautiful,"" Mom replied. ""Are they old?"" ""Let's just say I got them when I was about your age."" She spoke very slowly, almost with a natural stutter, but one could tell it was because of her age. She didn't wear any glasses which I thought was weird because I just assumed that all old people wore glasses to help them see. All I can remember thinking is maybe this old bag had some kind of Superman eyesight. My father and I poked around at some other junk. Dad was basically trying to appear as if he was really looking around for something while I was busy trying to find out if there were any G.I. Joe's in this pile of garbage.  ""There's no price on them, are they free?"" Mom laughed as she asked this. Always the packrat, trying to snag a freebie. The old lady, however, who seemed pleasant from the beginning, did not find this funny. ""Oh, I must have missed those,"" the old lady said. She reached out slowly and took one of the candlesticks from my mother's hands and held it in her own. She stared at it for a few seconds as if waiting for the price to slap her in the face. But to my disappointment (and my father's), there was no magical force leaping at her face and slapping the old lady in the mug. Not on this day at least.  ""Give me three dollars and you can take 'em,"" the lady said after a while. Mom reached into her purse and pulled out a five dollar bill and handed it to the old woman. Again, my mother attempted to make nice with the lady. ""Take the whole five,"" my mother said with a smile, and the old lady, indifferent in response to this gesture, turned and slowly walked away. Perhaps toward wherever she was keeping the loot she made off this tag sale. Meanwhile, my mother turned with a what-did-I-do look on her face and motioned to my father to let him know ""we're leaving now.""  That was about all the time we spent at the old lady's tag sale. How odd, I thought, that she did not have an old man accompanying her at her home? In fact, I didn't see anyone there who looked like they were helping her sell her old junk. Maybe her husband passed away some time ago. The thought left my mind about as quickly as we made it to the interstate.  It was a long ride home on I-91 as I felt we had accomplished nothing (no G.I. Joe's, no video games), but my mother was happy with her candlesticks so I suppose one could say ""mission accomplished."" She had no idea how soon she'd be getting rid of them. "
21509,4224651,"13,August,2004",2004-08-13,"   It was really just an ordinary October day. The leaves were changing (actually they had already changed, now they were falling), the grass stopped growing for the year and browning in some spots, and from the highway, as I watched from the backseat of my Dad's old Mercury Cougar, all the houses in the town below had wisps of smoke coming from the chimneys. It reminded me of a valley full of candles that had just been blown out.  It was 1984, and I was tagging along with Ma and Pa Dukes for the day (had no choice, I was 5 years old). Apparently, someone out in Greenfield, Massachusetts was foolish enough to have a tag sale (or a yard sale, or a rummage sale, depending on what part of this lovely country you're from) on this brisk Saturday morning in October. So naturally, it's my mother's job to drag her husband and youngest son off through the wilderness to pick through someone else's crap just in case there's something of value to her.  Mom was a bit of a talker as well. She'd chew my Dad's ear off the entire day and he would just turn his head and smile then and again just to show her he was listening. Now and then he would throw out the occasional, ""hmm,"" or ""oh yeah?"" but for the most part, he'd pretty much stare straight ahead and watch the road in front move toward him at a steady 55 mph clip. Someone once said my mother could talk a dog off of a meat wagon. I didn't understand what that meant (again, I was five).  From the backseat, in between battles with Shredder and the Ninja Turtles, all I could offer was the frequent, ""how much longer?"" ""Ten more minutes,"" my mother would say. Mom was infamous for replying with ""ten more minutes."" Ever notice how every time you asked your parents how much longer, it was always ""ten more minutes?"" It didn't really matter where you were going. You could have been 2 hours from the destination, but it didn't matter. I think every time I was told ""ten more minutes"" it had already been twenty minutes from the last time I'd asked.  About 45 minutes later, we arrived at the tag sale. "
21510,4224651,"13,August,2004",2004-08-13,"   I can't remember how many times I've been told this story. I used to think it was to keep my brothers and I from staying up late at night after my parents went to bed so we could watch old Family Ties reruns or soft-core porn on HBO. But you know how you start to believe things after you've heard them spoken of after so many times? Well, that's why I believe this story. That and the fact that I'm a grown man now and my parents still swear that the following events did indeed happen. After all, they never gave me a reason not to believe them. And I never gave them a reason to tell stories. None like this... "

Or am i just dreaming, one day waking up with another totally different personality as a totally different person, with a totally different life. Thoughts of such run through my head.       My existence. As i continue to journey through my life, i lose more and more of my consciousness, and i begin to realise... just how much of this is real.. What if this whole thing called my life was just a dream where i would wake up and never remember.      Im a christian and i believe that when i pass away, i will go on to be with God in heaven for eternity. But it doesnt stop thoughts from creeping into my mind. Thoughts of, what is eternity? Can there really be a forever? These short 75 years of an average human life if im even blessed with, what are they. The lives which we pass, are they just a repetition with our existences reliving it everytime we pass on, or is it forever etched in time once its passed, never to come back.      What is the Meaning of this all... What is the purpose... This moment im spending right now to type this all out... It will be passed, never again returned.. That much of a value i cannot describe, that i wish to savour whole heartedly, yet cannot...      How i wish, things were just so simple but they arent.....      ""Time passes me by as i sit and listen,   cries of folly, shouts of joy, happiness in abundance.   time it seems, we just have so much to spare,   what we don't realize is that time is not so keen to share.   what's passed, done and finished is over,   we will not be able to go back and start all over.....""

Something about its continuity that grants me certain peace and solace.       Sitting here thinking, am i doing the right thing? What should be the right thing in the first place. Regretting? hmm i definitely hope not for this will be the first time... I have always been so sure, so positive of my actions and never have i once looked back to say that sucks and i should not have done that. Why am i doing so now? What's going on.....      Pride, honour, Promise.... You can lose it all but these... They will be with you till your very end and eventually for humans, will be the measure of their worth. Am i worthless? Does it really matter? or am i just doing it to please... Who can i please if i cannot even please myself..      My cries for help go unnoticed, unheard.. The people around me all keep smiling, keep moving in the herd... Gradually i learned to accept, to forget... That as myself an individual, it doesnt matter much who cares or who doesnt.. Whose to know whats true and whats false.. Whats the point..      Will i regret writing this eventually? No... i wont... But will i regret actions i take in my life like one i have just done... Maybe.. Sadly.. Maybe.. It is an eventuality which even i fear i will face but hold on i will.....      ""suffering but i have no regret,   this pain how can i ever forget.   misery which stretches to unknown degrees,   my life spells out to the finality of tragedy.   dreaming, wishing, hoping for the sadness to be taken away,   only to be dissappointed, let down,    left alone eventually....""

11415,4225684,"20,August,2004",2004-08-20,"   Want.....      Is it necessity or pure selfish desire.. We want many things in life.. Career, contentment, money, food and the list goes on. But what is actually necessary and what is just due to plain old selfish desire. Have we ever stopped to think about it?       I need that!! I want that!! Buy it for me!! Get it for me!! Sound familiar? Many a times i have been guilty of selfish desire, but at that moment of time, i don't really notice it myself. My mother always tells me that she will one day hire a cameraman to follow me around and video record every single thing i say and do. She says that i will definitely not even recognize myself if i were to watch the video.       Personally, i hate to agree with that but i would think its true. Sometimes i know myself that i am unreasonable and demanding but i will deny all such accusations at that point of time. Its only after the whole matter has passed on when i will actually realize and think about my actions and how selfish they were. Necessary? Most of the time no... Most of the time my actions were purely of selfish desire.. Afterall we humans by nature are selfish people.      What is this strange feeling called desire? Why do we desire? Desire is more then just simple want, its somewhat of a craving, of a need... We suffer from desire just like how drug addicts suffer without their drugs... Can we ever learn to break free from these bonds and chains called desire binding us to this material plane? Or will we forever be slaves to materialism and forever feed the great fuel of desire and let it grow into a great big blaze.      ""Her smiles ever so melting, makes all in place.   Her touch ever so haunting, a wind's caress could never replace.   Her laughter, angels chanter, reminds me of heaven.   Oh how i thank god with all my heart, for depriving heaven of her grace."" "
11416,4225684,"19,August,2004",2004-08-19,"   Its not my fault. How many times in life have you heard these magical words uttered which seems to be able to shift the blame away from yourself.  Many times in life, we are all guilty of using these simple yet powerful words. Not my fault that happened. Not my fault this happened.    Well whose fault is it then? Before muttering those words without thinking, do we actually spare a thought to think about whether or not the situation might have been different if our actions had been different? So does it mean that it is not your fault and that the situation will still be the same if you had done pursued a different set of actions totally?      Like it or not, whatever actions we choose to do, it will in the end, affect those around us. Suicide will only result in loved ones breaking down and mourning over the loss. Betrayal will only cause those betrayed to be bitter and teach them to be more negative about life which is totally unnecessary. And love, well it can be both good and bad.. Ultimately, our actions, WILL affect those who are in immediate proximity to us.      Think for your actions are consequential. A simple lie can lead to great disaster and misunderstandings. A frown can sow discord and break relationships. And on the other hand, a simple smile can grow to a beautiful friendship which can be kept till the end of your life. Will you choose to act selfishly? or selflessly.. Make the choice, take the plunge but whatever it is, dont regret your choice for things in life can come and go, but choices we make will stick and be with us till we lie in our graves.      ""Saw your smile, felt your grace,   Entered a place called heaven,    wished it wouldnt displace.   Dreamt of kisses, Sensations of love,   Woke up alone, lying in that bed so cold.   The grip of that hand, the firm affirmation,   guides me closer, to what you call salvation.   My actions all lead me, all let me confirm,   that what i do is not entirely of me,   but totally for you....."" "
11417,4225684,"18,August,2004",2004-08-18,"   urlLink   ""Hello, Good morning, How you Do"" Lyrics from Switchfoot - Learning to Breathe   When was the last time you actually greeted a friend with a proper greeting as such?    Do you take things for granted, that you will see your friend again or do you actually treasure every single moment spent with that companion.      When you smile, do you actually realise what you are doing? You can either be making somebody's day turn from bad to good or.. You could just be cheating the person if you didnt mean the smile. People see me smile, hear me laugh, but can they be sure it is for real? Have they ever stopped to think, wait a minute, he can't be laughing at this can he?       Personally, i take the good with the bad and whatever the situation, i believe in smiling. Even if its a forced smile where i have to cram up the corners of my lips, i force myself to do so. If i really have to force myself to smile i am in fact contradicting myself but i will do so because one sad person is enough... The world is full of sad faces, take the time to look around. Enjoy the lush scenery you see and ignore the frowns. Smile and be greeted with another smile and slowly, slowly all will be back in place....      ""As people age, As people grow,   They lose their sense, they make more foes.   Frowns a plenty, mostly blamed on responsibility,    Life they say, has taken such a toll.   Childish are acts which seem insensible to them,   but whose to say whose grown up when?   All one can do is smile and wait,    time will tell, chase your fate."" "
11418,4225684,"17,August,2004",2004-08-17,"   Dreams.. Im sure every single one of us have them. Not just your simple crazy dreams of school life or adventures. But dreams of falling in love, getting married and even death.  What do dreams actually represent? Desire? Direction? Or are dreams really merely an indication of things to come.      Yesterday's dream was particularly intriguing. The whole dream was full of action and it involved all the people whom i were close to in my life. The most interesting aspect of it was that my hands were amputated halfway throughout (why though i still do not know why) and those people started to leave one by one. Suprisingly though, in my dream i did not cry when that happened. I only smiled and laughed as the dream ploughed on and finally only ending when i woke up in cold sweat. The dream really troubled me for a portion of the morning. It made me wonder what was my subconscious mind really feeling. Lyrics from a song Gary Jules - Mad World came to my head ""And I find it kinda funny, I find it kinda sad. The dreams in which I'm dying, are the best I've ever had.""      Do i really know myself and can claim to be in control of my mind. Or is there a possibility of me actually losing it. That dream really scared me as it seemed like there was a possibility indeed. Can i claim to know more then i actually know or is reality just a cruel mirror which shows nothing but voidness.          ""Blatant lies are told everyday,   but your eyes seem to give the game away.   Where is truth, has it lost its way,   another broken promise, another dismay.   Where i have cried, where i have died,   i can only hope and pray to see a better day."" "
11419,4225684,"16,August,2004",2004-08-16,"   Have you ever truly felt alive? What does it mean to be alive? To be able to see, hear, touch, smell, taste? Is that what it truly means? Or is there something else that is lacking in order to complete this equation..      Today was just another day where it seemed like i wasn't alive. Simple day with hardly any real interactions with people face-to-face, everything but was of mere conversations through text and pictures. I realise the time on this kind of days past by more slowly then normal, why though i still wonder.      On days where i am with people it is of a different matter altogether. Be it a whole day or just a short hour, it seems like time flies when theres interaction with other human beings whilst in their prescence.       Why do some days feel and seem shorter then others? Does it really mean that time flies when your having fun? Our time on this earth is short and limited. Many times i have heard people lamenting about how their lives suck or how much they just wish to die.. If i could i would show them what i see, about how limited our time on this life actually is and how many things there is to be done. Compared to people whose lives have been taken away from them unwillingly, here we have selfish people wishing for theirs to be taken away.   I guess we really like to take things for granted...      You will lose your life eventually one day. Choose the way to go when its the end. Either be a loser who never once saw the bright of life, or be someone who realised how precious it can be.. People often tell me to slow down, to stop thinking so much. Personally when humans dont think thats when they err..       We dont think about where we are going, what we are doing and most importantly of the consequences. We say many things which we never mean to do eventually and we do many things which we come to realise and regret after the consequences are clear. Many times in life i have made that mistake and awful a mistake it is to make. To realise that there could have been another alternative and to have been able to be better. Or to realise that it could have been worse and to have ended up in a lousier situation.      Instead of feeling that i am thinking too much, maybe, just maybe, i should feel that i am thinking too little and i should think more....      ""Time slips through hands like water on glass,    people feel that they have too many hours.   Minutes to kill, seconds to spare,   when they finally stop breathing, i hope they wont despair,   that time was too little, it just wasn't fair..."" "

It was like a breath of fresh oxygen after diving in that deep blue sea for so long. I felt my lungs pumped, my mind energized but most importantly, i felt my heart beat once more.  The emotion that im speaking of is undescribable.. Have you ever felt happiness just by looking at the wide grin on that face? Have you ever felt joy by just hearing that laugh so innocent yet jovial? Has your spirits ever been raised by a companion who does so little but yet it seems so much?  I sure am glad that i have found this emotion once again. Be it temporary or permanent, it sure was a great relief from many other emotions i have been experiencing lately. Though i hope for it to last, the sad chorus from november rain - Guns and Roses of ""Nothing lasts forever"" just keeps playing.. Well forever is a long long time, and i know that on my part, forever will seem like just another day as long as i continue to experience and feel this emotion i am so grateful to feel...     ""An Angels carress, so gentle yet full of feeling. A Demons words, so little yet full of fearing. Light from heaven fills my day, Dark from hell blinds my way.

Ironically, i had said i was never going to be interested in doing a blog as i was not that sort of ""person"".. Well i guess i did not even realise what that sort of ""person"" was when i said those words out aloud..    Why the sudden interest in blogging? Sleepless nights + Nobody to talk to (besides God) + lack of stuff to do = blogging... But more importantly, i felt i needed somewhere or something where i could express myself freely.. free of being criticized at the instantenous action of making a stupid remark or a careless slip of my tactless tongue...      I was once asked a question, if you could change anything in your life, what would it be... At that point of time i had not thought the question through carefully and just spurted out a simple answer of ""Nothing."" I felt the lack of need to change anything that has happened in my life as anything different would not have made me the person i am today.. Thinking back on that question, if i were to be asked the same thing, i would answer the same way i guess... I would like to use this chance to say a big SORRY to anybody and everybody whom i have upset in any way or any manner.. be it a small let down to a big disappointment.. I want to say SORRY for being an insensitive jerk and for being the sorry person that i am.. There is only so much i can express verbally and through my words but i can only learn with each passing mistake and look up to those in heaven and pray as i smile on this earth still today..      Once more, sorry whoever you are, whereever you are.. Sorry for me being me...      ""Time whiles by, as i sit here today.    Dreams of you, offer nought but comfort to my mind.

OH - but i DID see an accident happen right in front of me yesterday morning.... i guess that qualifies as something. so here's a short story on my brief adventure:     as i was going going about my merry way to work, singing along w/ avril, i heard a huge metal on metal *thud*. i looked up and saw papers flying up in the air. for a second it looked like a big water fountain in the middle of 237, spewing out someone's thesis. after slamming my brakes, i sat in amazement as i saw a little green civic fishtail and spin its way towards my lane, and an old honky truck swerving all over the highway w/ it's hood crumpled up like a piece of foil. when the noise settled and the screeching stopped, what lay directly in front of me was a car facing forward, and another car in front of him facing the center divide. all i could remember as she screeched to a halt was dead silence (for a few seconds) her head jerking forward and back and forward again like a bobble head, and white paper falling to the ground like snow. it was pretty crazy. the first thoughts running through my head were: ""is she ok? is there BLOOD? should i get out and help her? thank GAWD i traded in my civic..."" how terrible is THAT?! in the midst of an accident, i was thinking of my car. jeeez, i hope i don't burn in hell for that one. well, thank goodness she turned out to be ok, and there were about 3 guys who stopped and started running towards her so i felt ok leaving. after driving around the broken bottles, binders, a shoe (she had a TON of crap in her trunk) and stupid onlookers who effing stopped and started CREATING TRAFFIC - you BASTARDS - i continued on my morning drive and played 'guess the celebrity' along w/ sarah and no name on alice radio.      I guess the lessons learned here is: 1. drive carefully damnit 2. don't put piles of paper in your trunk 3. minnie driver dated 3 of her leading men 4. be thankful that you don't drive a little civic. and if you do, consider trading it in.

30576,4227371,"16,August,2004",2004-08-16,"    my hands STINK from cutting an ass load of garlic yesterday. grossness.... i've washed my hands a million times, w/ 5 different soaps. how do you get this stank ass smell off??!?!? anyone?!?! please advise!!! i had my ""i'm a little boy inside"" fill for the month. okay, maybe a few weeks... took my 3 favorite toys out this weekend - my truck, bike, and atv. drove 3.5 hrs to meet the whole clan for a family shindig at my cousin's place in lincoln (NE of sac, right next to a little town called the middle of NOWHERE). woohoo!!! i had so much fun. just makes me really really miss hanging out w/ my pops and bro doing guy stuff like that.... just us, 2 atv's, a dirtbike and an open lot behind target, where stupid costco and other crap now sits. sometimes i just feel like yelling: ""EFF YOU CIVILIZATION!!! you keep taking all the good spots for 4wheeling!!! DIRT HOGS!"" now, there's nowhere around vallejo to take our toys out to ""gather dust"". well, nowhere illegal anyway. those are the best spots. no, seriously. right before they build houses, there's all those hills and mounds of dirt.... sooooooooo fun...... aaaaah, memories. now my baby's back in the city - the dirtiest car in the whole parking lot. i could't be more proud... (sniff sniff) and i've finally decided on a name for my truck - ""beast"". definitely a boy car. most definitely.   "
30577,4227371,"13,August,2004",2004-08-13,"    hey thanks for setting up my blog rj. hope i don't bore you too much. as for everyone else, if you get bored, tough shit. sometimes i'm boring. so sue me...... wish me luck - here i go!!!   "
30578,4227371,"13,August,2004",2004-08-13,"    I said goodbye to my food today.    yeah, i did. really.  don't you hate it when you're eating out and you have just a little bit left? you're too full to finish those last few bites... but it's too small for a doggie bag cause you'll feel stupid packing 3 pieces of chicken and a couple spoonfulls of pasta? doesn't it feel like a waste? don't you hear starving people sitting in your plate saying ""eat me, you WASTER OF FOOD""? well, i do. damn that philanthropist in me. so i said goodbye to my chicken and something alfredo as i was leaving the table today. i just felt bad leaving it behind.

10139,4227656,"21,August,2004",2004-08-21,"   So...this youth group.  It doesn't come with instructions.  Hmmm that reminds me of what new parents say about kids.  Is this the same?  Am I now a mother preparing for her newborn?  Or am I merely a caretaker and God is the father of this new baby?  Maybe I should know the answer to that question. I need to have a network of people around me already in the ministry, but so many of them are already too busy.  I understand that, but then feel left standing in a foreign land without instructions.  The instructions?  Hmm maybe the Bible, but ... then there's the age old question of how to decode some of the answers.  And also the age old problem of waiting on God. So here I am standing on the border between my old life and a totally foreign land.  I barely speak the language and barely understand the culture, but I have a passion burning so hot inside me that if I don't move it will consume me ... destroy me. I have to start a youth group.  I get to.  But ... how. I ask the question and it seems to bounce off the empty spaces around me.  They say that they are there to support me, but I don't think they really understand what it's like until they too have to step out there and try it. A name?  A theme?  What to study first?  Do I talk and sign at the same time?  Do I relate to only the Deaf?  Do I include the hearing?  Do I start a middle school plus high school group?  Do I seperate it?  What do I do when I get there? They trust me.....What an overwhelming responsibility.  "
10140,4227656,"18,August,2004",2004-08-18,"   Well, it's getting to the point that I'm beginning to feel spred too thin and can barely keep from crying when I think about all the things I need and all the things I don't have.  I still have faith and I still trust God, but I feel like the faith and the trust is beginning to fade.  It's like I've held on to the ledge for a really long time and my fingers are beginning to slip, my arms are no longer able to hold on to the promise that God will provide.  I know that I need to keep trusting and keep the faith, but it's getting harder.  I also wonder, now, just how many people out there wait years for things and keep the faith.  Where does it come from?   *sigh* I'm waiting for God to open the flood gates and provide all of the things I need.  I want my dad to see that God really does give us things that we need, that He provides in times of need and that miracles do really happen.  I think my dad's going crazy over this whole thing...worse then me.  I really would like to show my dad and help him revive his faith in God.  I wonder if I'm doing something wrong ... or not doing something that I should be doing.  When I think about it nothing comes to mind, but ... maybe I'm not thinking hard enough.  Or maybe these are the lies of the devil. Please don't you have any answers?  "

10142,4227656,"17,August,2004",2004-08-17,"   Well...I got to work today!  My dad has a friend that needed some doors painted and some yard work done.  I worked 5 hours today and will probably work about that many on Thursday.  I'm hoping it will help me out a little. Come to find out my clothes are falling apart and I'm desprate for some more, but I don't have any money.  I know that sounds like the same old same old, but it's true!  I'm trying hard to be good about not spending my money, but ... I don't know how much longer I""m going to be able to last without money.  I know I'll be poor, but I'd at least like something.  Okay so right now I'd like a lot of something, because I need it to move to Southern Cali. Pray.  "
10143,4227656,"13,August,2004",2004-08-13,"   Well, I created another online journel here at blogspot, because of Barbara!  I also like that they changed the format.  I like that you can now add comments. This is actually my second online journal, but I don't mind.  This actually has a different tone then the other one. I hope that I can actually get people reading this thing!  That's actually rather difficult to do.  I wonder why!  It's rather like an email without all the hassal of trying to get all the right addresses and stuff like that! I hope I can keep up with this. I haven't heard from the church in Riverside yet and a lot of people keep asking me about it.  All I can say is keep praying.  I know that worrying does me no good and gets me no where, but I feel like I want to start worrying more.  It's hard to keep the faith and hope alive when I see no real good solution. Waiting for miracles.  "

12159,4236023,"22,August,2004",2004-08-22,"   Okay, so I just got back from my cousin's wedding... Mike Bitner.  He got married to Marsha Edmenson (Or however it's spelled), and that's cool and everything, but he asked me to film it for him, and I tried... and it might turn out okay, but I don't know.  I went to a rehersal dinner yesterday and felt awkward because I didn't know anyone.  Well, tonight was about as awkward, only, my family was there, so it was okay, because I just talked to Loren and Erin when I didn't know what to do.   The filming went okay, I guess, I felt odd, walking around, taping stuff while there was an official wedding going on and whatnot, but it was outside in the woods near a little beach thingy, so I guess it was a little unorthodox to start with.  Plus, most of the time, other than the obvious parents, pastor, and the to-be-married themself, I didn't really know who else they wanted me to capture on film, so I just kinda got everyone.  I figure Mike can just cut out whoever he wants from the video, so it's no skin off my nose.  Anyway, I'm getting behind in this blogging thing... and I don't really feel like working on it right now.  Exactly what I was afraid would happen.  So... I guess I'll catch up when I do. "
12160,4236023,"21,August,2004",2004-08-21,"   Today I basically wasted my whole day at work.  Usually I don't feel a day at work has been wasted, but this paticular day consisted of seven hours of almost nothing.  Slow, tedious, never-ending nothing.  Nothing in a place that nothing is not meant to be.  Not nothing in a nice, air-conditioned room watching meaningless cartoons, nothing in a hot, oven-heated, angry-customer-filled room that smells bad.  (not that bad, but I was going for the contrast).  Also, the other night, I went with some people to go see ""Collateral"".  It was an odd movie staring Jamie Foxx and Tom Cruise.  Basically what happens is this guy makes this taxi driver drive around to all of these witnesses that he has to kill, and the cab driver keeps trying to get away or get help, but it never works.  I won't give away what happens, but it's a really depressing ending, so get ready to cry for years.  Also, another odd fact of going to see the movie is that Mrs. Eubanks, my 7th grade Reading teacher was there.  I haven't seen her since, say... 7th grade.  But I knew who she was.  I didn't quite recognize her; she didn't have her trademark humungo glasses on.  Or her large cup of coffee that she spent half an hour getting, either.  And she didn't assign us to read any books about war, or black city sports, or anything like that.  SO, we had an awkward moment, because she happened to be seeing the same movie we were, and was waiting for a couple of girls outside of the theatre.  We were already late, and I wanted to catch as much of the previews as I could, but she was doing some figuring out of who we were, and she was definetly taking her time with it.  Especially Krystle who, after several minutes, she decided she had never taught.  10 points for Eubanks!  She thought I had graduated, too.  Oh well, if I was a teacher, I wouldn't remember my students very well, either.  I will admit to that.  Anyway, it's horribly late, and I have to go to work and then a wedding tomorrow, so I'll work on this later.  Ciao! "
12161,4236023,"19,August,2004",2004-08-19,"   For LHS's National Honor Society, a new crudential has been added.  Ten hours of community service.  Now that's all fine and dandy with me, but I'm not exactly sure what counts as community service.  Apparently, though, I've already gotten roughly 5 hours of it.  Today, I spent about two hours gathering ""first-day"" paper bundles for school with David.  We had as much fun with it as is possible, and got to see Dr. Z, who unlocked some doors for us.  But the real story was yesterday.  David and I were painting the pastor's picket fence white, and we'd just gotten about a third of the outside done, when all of a sudden, these two guys start shouting at eachother.  I was aquainted with one of them, I see him around every now and then, and he's dating a girl in my class.  The other guy, I had only just met him, and he was helping paint the fence.  I would think maybe both of these guys are in their early to mid twenties, but I'm not really sure.  At least that old.  But anyway, the boyfriend introduces himself to the guy, and tells him that they need to talk.  Well, he asks what about, and the boyfriend says thy need to talk about why he's all over a 15-year old, or something like that.  And then they start shouting, and the boyfriend's yelling, ""Go ahead, hit me!"" and it was really funny and awkward, David and I sitting there painting, trying to keep from laughing.  Very interesting.  Anyway, we got three more hours right there, so we're already half way.  Anyway, I've got an orthodontist appointment to attend to, so I guess I'll touch base later, ay? "
12162,4236023,"17,August,2004",2004-08-17,"   Well, as much as I'd like to keep everyone on the edge of their seats, I still don't really have much to report... go figure.  I'm still doing the exact same thing I mentioned in my previous entry every day, and I probably will be until school starts.  The one thing I did do differently yesterday was go out to the covered bridge with David and Krystle.  We had a good time, we scared the whirlygig beetles, and fed cheese twists to a frisky chipmunk, which, after fleeing into his hole, we then attempted to drown with some coke, and we also got rust stains all over us on the swings (at least David did).  It was a nice change of pace, Krystle made us all Turkey sandwiches, and we ate them as the swift currents of the calm river peacefully relaxed our minds... Ah, yes... Then we came back and just hung around, found out I still have some bugs to fix in my hook-up of our entertainment center, and played Simpsons Clue  (I won, it was all too obvious that it was Homer in the Kwik-E-Mart with the slingshot).  Ah, yes, the productive life of me.  It's a simple life, but I enjoy it.  Anyway, that baritone isn't going to learn how to play itself... and neither am I, at this rate... More to come later! (Aren't you excited?) "
12163,4236023,"16,August,2004",2004-08-16,"   Okay, still not much to report. All's silent on the western front. But I have to be patient. I mean, as soon as school starts, all kinds of stuff is going to start happening, and that's good.       This summer went really fast, but compared to other summers, seemed to consist of nothing. In one aspect, that's kind of sad, but maybe it will help me to appreciate this school year more. Sure, school means getting up earlier, having assignments due, having to deal with some people that I'd rather not, but on the flipside, I get to see a lot more people that I miss over the summer and some of my classes are even fun. An example of this will hopefully be my AP English class.       There are a lot of good kids in that class, kids I can have fun with.  Sam, Matt, Scott, David, and a few more that I can't quite remember off of my head.  All of my memories of Mrs. Young's 10th grade class are simply of Scott and I doing as we pleased, but still getting the highest grades in that class.  And that's pretty cool.  I figure this class will either be really easy and fun, or really hard and fun.  Either way, that's a good deal.       Also first sememster, I have some video editing class with Mr. Ehrmantraut for no credit, and I saw some real undeserving people sign up for it, so I don't know how that will go.  David's in it with me, too, and that's wicked awesome, because I haven't had a lot of classes with my friends in High School, what with Spanish and Agriculture.  Spanish was at least worth it, because I've met a lot of neat people in those classes, and Mrs. Simmers is pretty awesome.  Now, Agriculture... I can't say much for that class.  It was a good class, but the only person I felt I could really talk to in there was Jarrod Pollard, even though Mrs. Carnigie was really nice, too.       Anyway, I had better get back to what I've been doing for the past few weeks: Playing Nintendo, reading English AP books, and practicing baritone.  So, until next time, don't spend all of your potatoes in one place. "
12164,4236023,"14,August,2004",2004-08-14,"   Welcome to my blog!  This is, perhaps, my third attempt at one of these ""on-line journal"" type things, and I'm having big dreams and hopes for it.  Ah, the possibilities of the internet.  For example, I bet Josh Server from All That is reading this right now... I can only dream... "
8396,4238006,"22,August,2004",2004-08-22,"   School is back in YAY!!! Well my week was pretty uninventful. I went Bowling on Friday and I also went to a Chruch Lockin. It was pretty fun, we played Mafia and a game called Underground Chruch. It's relly hard for me to explain in typing, but trust me when i say it's like hide and go seak on crack...it's a sweet game. Well thats about all I got now, i'll try to do something more interresting later on in this week. "
8397,4238006,"15,August,2004",2004-08-15,"   * Beware this is a long post*   Well I guess not that I have yet to get any sleep I'll go ahead and tell you guys about my adventures on Wensday through Friday. Ok it all started out with my friend Andrew calling and telling me that there was a Halo party at my other friend Tom's house (we do this ever so ofter, this was different because we had 2 X-Boxes). Well after a few hours went bye I called my other friend whow as going Nathan and asked what the hold up was. It seems my friend can't count and doesn't know the difference between 10 and 7. Well at about 10 or 9:30 after Nathan called this other guy i know who i guess i could call a friend now Walter comes and picks me up. It takes some time but we make it to Tom's house, and on the way invite another friend Wyatt. We get to the house to relize that 1.) we have the wrong A.V. cables and 2.) Microsoft has to squeeze every penny out of you they can so we need to get a X-Box ethernet cable. Well this takes us to a closed Big-K mart, and a Super Wallmart...and as you can guess, the Super Wallmart doesn't have the freaking cord we need. Well we call Wyatt, or he calls us...I can't remember, and we decide to meet them at the Wallmart because it's closer to them. As we wait we (Nathan, Tom, and I) decide to get some food while Walter plays Deer Hunter. We end up stocking up with a box of 120 pizza rolls for like 9 bucks, 4 pizza's that are $.98 a peice, 2 sodas that are 2 for $1 and a pack of swiss rolls that are $1.09...yeah we were loaded. So we end up meetin Wyatt and Andrew...and it's about 11 or so at this point in time. And we go off on our way back to Tom's house with our newly aquired food. We start playing X-Box for a while and we play some Super Smash Brothers Melee. After this Nathan, Tom, and I start to prepare our food, when suddenly the bejesus is scared out of us by Casey, Heather, and Luran (yes more friends). We at first think we mass hullicinated and tell Andrew, Walter, and Wyatt what we saw. We then get a call saying that they want to meet us at a bowling alley...we at first decline, but a few of us put up a fight and it is decided that we go...oh and it is 1 am now. Well, we get outside and notice that Walter's car has been wrapped with plastic wrap...and as we then find out they put crisco inside the door handles. At this point we're pumped...except Tom who has decided to go to sleep (lightweight)...and decide to plan a counter attack. For this talk we get 1.) Flour 2.) Soap 3.) A Super Soaker (anti-personale) 4.) Eggs. Well we decide that we are going to flower the bejesus out of their cars and make it stick with the liquid soap we have...the eggs serve no use in the first attack and we end up buying more. Back to the present, we figure out that they are at a Waffle House and meet them there before we go to the bowling alley, we play it cool and act as if nothing had happened...and we notice their insecurity. We both go together to get gas and after Walter refules his car they decide to go back to the house at which they are staying and switch cars. Wyatt then come up with a brilliant plan of going to the house, waiting for them to leave and striking at the cars that are left over. This is facilitated by Andrew getting us balls lost around their neighborhood, how does this work out you say?? Well as we finally know where we are going we see their newly aquired car turn out onto the road we're using. We immedantly pull over and turn our lights off. What then follows is a tatical strike that totally demolished their cars. They are covered in flour and soap, not to mention pizza (i forgot to mention we brought a pizza with us) which was stuffed under the door handles. We go bowling and from what I gather they struck at us in the parking lot taking a 2/3 stance...oh and they still at this point have no idea what we've done. They get us good though when we get back to Tom's they pelt us with water balloons...very inaccuratly though. This all takes place bewteen 1 and 6 in the morning. The next night is proceded by another ninja esque strike where Walter and I meet with them to discuss the rules. We have our firends Maggie, Paul, and Wyatt bail and we use a cover story of them getting lost and we need to go look for them. What then happens is us taking them around the building and having to dart for Walters car due to our perfectly mastered strike, the retelation the plan is ineffectual when we manage to bipass the crappy road block they have created, pick up the crew and move back to the foward base (Nathan's house tonight)...oh the strike was a flowering and us using the window markers you see on car windows to write I think it was Cunt all over their car. As it so happens Walter leaves at 3 in the morning thus they have no car to strike at...but as it seems they manage to hit Maggie's car by writing explatives over her car. I'm not sure if the war was continued on Friday...but I don't think it was. All in all I would like to conclude that we won the major battles and our percision got us the war...but if nothing else we tied. It was a fair fight and one I think would be fun to continue later on. "
8398,4238006,"15,August,2004",2004-08-15,"   Well, I've finally done it....I have a blog. I though I'd get one so I could write down all the remenial tasks I do a day, cause I know everyone is interrested in my sweet ass life. I like the name, but I'm suprised it wasn't taken...like everything else I tried to choose for my screen name and web adress. I'll leave all you people out there to figure it's reference out...and once I get to it.. and if I can figure it out I'll try to post the random pictures I've taken out of boredom. I'm sure if you've come here you have my AIM screen name...as it's the only refuge for the link, but if you don't my moniker is Killerfurball. Ok for those of you who know nothing about me my real name is Michael and I live in Nashville, TN...please no hick jokes. I like a lot of different forms of music...such as Rock, Rap, some Techno, and....thats it really. Oh I have a complete distaste for Country music. I like video games, they are a good drain of my time, and I find them very entertaining, especially the RPG's, anything with an emersive story can usually pull me in....though I never realy liked the FF series. Ok well to the actual reason I created this blog....I like to write...even though I have yet to write 4 AP US History essays due in...well...1 day. I have a few links everyone need to check out (I'll have even more once my friend gets on AIM and I can copy and paste them to this) www.seizurerobots.com oh, please don't go to that if your an epileptic...I don't want anyone having a seizure  urlLink www.lowwatermusic.com  I like this band...they have 3 mp3's for download on their site and 3 videoes. Just because I know everyone is dieing to know what I am doing at this ungodly hour...I seem to be watching a Snoop Dogg video on MTV2, I think I might just switch it back to Old School though...thats a good movie, I suggest everyone go see AVP...on the premsis that it's Aliens vs Preaditor...I mean that alone warrents a good movie (pfft), actually it wasn't as bad as I though it was going to be...least it wasn't Van Helsing, god I can't believe I paid 8 bucks to see that movie. Well, I guess I'll post more stuff in this blog later today...I'm going to allow comments but please guys/gals keep it down. "
7933,4238152,"15,August,2004",2004-08-15,"   Musings At Anderson By: Nofing  Of late, Iâ€™ve come to notice how seriously the school values their studentâ€™s opinions. This is especially so for the less positive, less pleasant and well, cruder remarks. Not that Iâ€™ve failed to notice over my past three years at Anderson but what Mr. Ang mentioned just recently made me sit up and wonder what really is their problem or our problem? In school, there are only two sorts of bright sparks â€“ those at 3/7 and those at 3/1. Those in between are just  in â€“ betweens . See, those at 3/7 are nice, respectable students who do their work and keep to themselves. Those at the other side of the rainbow however, are a darker shade of  black . They are bright no doubt and self â€“ opinioned. They are the people PM Lee wants (donâ€™t wait to be invited to tea instead take theâ€¦). Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for our brethren Dr. Chee Soon Juan. Ironically the situation is also the same at Anderson. However, the issue Mr. Ang raised was of similar nature. A secondary 2 student had been voicing his strong opinions on his online blog. Not that I am praising him but certainly there must be room for creativity and self â€“ reflection? Of course, the nature and content of his online entries must be taken into consideration. To what extent was it crude and slanderous, which at the same time is very unbecoming of Andersonians. Certainly voicing out oneâ€™s feelings isnâ€™t wrong or else esteemed writers like Mr. Humphrey and Mr. Brown would have been taken to task? However, cracking blue jokes and touching on controversial issues like what an extremely unwise Sheikh Haikel did would get you into unwanted trouble. As much as I wish to contend with the fact that airing oneâ€™s opinions is perfectly fine as long as one toes the line, it is disappointing to note that Mr. Ang also found usage of vulgarities and dialects of unprintable nature hard to swallow. I am one would enjoys the beauty of languages. The less refined bits are part and parcel of it not that it is encouraged but like the finer points of any language, it allows for better expression. I feel that instead of condemning these words and phrases alike, we must learn to accept them and realize that at times, it is that special word that bridges the gap. Of course, Mr. Angâ€™s cause for concern is understandable. Singaporeans are a refined lot like their British counter â€“ parts where the f word is used without so much as a bat of the eyelid. Dialects are an art. They represent our forefatherâ€™s culture. Their way of life, which at that time was tough â€“ going, and their manner of speech was likewise influenced. Many a time, I find it strange that people take pleasure in back â€“ biting others. I do not stand for that. Instead, we must take pride in our words and actions. Others should not determine our lives; neither should someone else dictate our words and actions. We live in a society of freedom of speech where as far as Iâ€™m concerned is as fair as doing a â€œCheeâ€. I find it all contradictory â€“ indeed there is allowance for freedom of speech but like the â€œCheeâ€ incident, but like the governments stand on cults, it is fine as long as it does not put the countryâ€™s welfare/interest/â€¦ at risk. When I say taking pleasure in back â€“ biting others, I am of course referring to Andersonâ€™s latest case of defamatory remarks. Obviously, the culprit must have heard of Ericâ€™s misdemeanors. The sad thing is, this guy hid behind a mask. By posting his comments online, he has placed fellow writer Eric and myself in bad light. Indeed we have committed offences of similar nature but we â€œclaimed the creditâ€ didnâ€™t we? Though uncommon, his isnâ€™t the first case that Iâ€™ve heard of. Its has happened on our level (sec 3) too but of course being kind and gracious and out of respect for the parties involved, I shall not give names. I feel that Mr. Angâ€™s take on studentâ€™s opinions is a little over the limit. Indeed, like the government, he has the schoolâ€™s welfare at heart. But what about us â€“ the student body? Has the school as a whole ever considered the plight we writers are in? We have no medium though which we can express ourselves, not online much less on paper. So, tell me please, where does that leave us? We are merely giving our 2 cents worth and also humoring our friends. Of course this shouldnâ€™t be done at the expense of someone else say a teacher in this case. But certainly just some harmless comments about the teacher wouldnâ€™t be in the red? Certainly, we will not make such statements without evidence but if there is cause and justification for it, why not? What the sec 2 boy did was definitely out of the question because from what I know, he made hurtful comments about teachersâ€™ and classmatesâ€™ physical appearances. Obviously this greenhorn has lots to learn about being witty yet within limits or should I say lessons on maturity? I feel what he did was way under the belt. To discredit people is already putting one foot in the grave. To hide behind a mask, nailing the coffin. Perhaps, it is time for change, a revolution, and a better tomorrow as our beloved politicians love to proclaim with much enthusiasm though I believe it less and less each day. For starters, lets have a private online forum where only true â€“ blue Anderson writers would be allowed. These might be a source of comfort for Mr. Ang because at the very least, our more meaningful remarks would be kept within ourselves. An interesting point to note is that every time such an incident crops up, Mr. Ang never fails to make mention of it but he only notifies us of the problem. What about his proposed solution? For three good years Iâ€™ve heard nothing but his â€˜pressing issuesâ€™ even in sec 1 when I was none the wiser, he didnâ€™t have any long â€“ term solution. To spell it out simply, the school on its part is doing nothing than providing short â€“ term solutions but in the long run, how effective would such a method be? From the way I see it, their methods are more of deterrence to would be  offenders  and nothing more. Such a tried and tested method would soon work off all its magic. At times, I really have this urge to grab my trusty pen and work my  magic  but my run â€“ in with the school or more specifically Mr. Ang has  deterred  me. As you can see, all is not lost. The schoolâ€™s tried and tested method still holds and hopefully so until I graduate. And when that time comes, I would say,â€ Au revoir Anderson! Never fret, itâ€™s never too late to teach an  old dog  new tricks.â€   Nofing is a sec 3 student would takes Mr. Angâ€™s opinions to heart ever since his run â€“ in with him a long time ago and has been faithfully chronically the more meaningful happenings at Anderson.   "
7934,4238152,"17,August,2004",2004-08-17,"   By: Nofing  Teachers have an inferiority complex. Itâ€™s very obvious â€“ take a look at good old Mr. Ang. His catch phrase though I only heard it once, was â€œI know I look like a fool talking to you people on stage.â€ Real fascinating. And much recently, the most  respectable  Mdm. Neo joined those ranks too. Her catch phrase, â€œI know that even before I start (speaking) some of you will call me â€˜ siao â€™ but I have to do so for the sake of the class.â€ Sounds like a true blue PAP supporter eh? Now before I digress into PAP politics, let me make mention of Mdm. Neoâ€™s most  commendable  speech all of which happened within the four walls with a hole in class 3 / 2. The bell was just about to go. I was as usual waiting to bid farewell being the most courteous student that I am. Today had been a most meaningful Geography lesson. Why? Because Shawn was seating with us and Bo Hui had apparently skipped the first lesson, lost count of time and didnâ€™t even turn up for school, which, is a good thing. Shawn had served very well as my  personal entertainer  but in Mdm Neoâ€™s undisputed opinion, he was a personal disaster. And disaster there was! Mdm. Neo took it t herself to berate the two of us. Quite simply, she stood at the OHP as she always does (because no one will think of having her near themselves) and for the ninth time looked as if though she was on the verge of an emotional breakdown, placed her marker down, glared at us (Rather contradictory, beats me too. But Mdm. Neo is most unpredictable at times) and started her little speech. â€œI donâ€™t wish to say this but there are a few students who are very disruptive. They choose not to or cannot fir into society and form their own group or a delinquent subculture. They value things which society doesnâ€™t value a lot.â€ Pauses to look at Shawn and I then draws some weird diagram on the OHP before continuing, â€œThings like rudeness and defiance,â€ pauses again to look at us. And so her speech goes, punctured with sporadic pauses now and then and also injected with Shawnâ€™s cynical remarks and our laughter. Little is known as to why Mdm. Neo embarked on her highly controversial and questionable speech. Some kind souls who were most touched by her speech said that she was sincere for once. Not very credible but itâ€™ll do. Shawn on the other hand had an entirely different opinion. â€œSincerity will not melt stone.â€ That sounds more like my idea of the  catch phrase  of the year! Indeed Mdm. Neo must have been a sorry sight. But I beg to differ. One, we (Shawn and I) have come to a conclusion â€“ That must have been a publicity stunt which further proves her mental instability. We donâ€™t mean that in a bad way. All we want to say is Mdm. Neo seemed rather out of touch today like as if though she was leaving us (which I hope she would and also leave for good) and that speech was some sort of farewell speech. Two, we wish to thank her for her kindness and concern but could she please wake up to the notion of actions speak louder than words and help us ace our Geography instead? Or must she in what is supposed to be thoughtful and sincere insult us. Not that she came hard on but she played it cool with nearly 80% of her little speech directed at us. We applaud her for her subtleness but hope that as soon as  sows  learn to fly, so would she learn the true meaning of sincerity. This refers to being forthright and to the point. For example, Shawn and I were discussing the different ways to shut Mdm. Neo up. Suggestions raised included throwing the pen knife at her, flinging paper balls and last but not least, walking out of the class. Unfortunately, we were mentally sound and ran through those ideas once more and the verdict was â€“ lets just sit here enjoy the air con and annoy Mdm. Neo. This might sound very passive in comparism to the aforementioned ideas and we canâ€™t agree more. For now, we shall follow by example â€“ that is to say learn from Mdm. Neo. Sheâ€™s not the only one who can do things subtlety. We shall show her our appreciation by sitting together during her future lessons and see how long itâ€™ll take before she yells at us and flings the OHP over (Now you know why she stands next to the OHP and not outside the class). Bearing that in mind, as good OP supporters, we shall declare, â€œThat has been long enoughâ€ I know, I know, youâ€™re referring to my article.  Nofing is still unable to get over the incident, having been influenced by Mdm. Neoâ€™s mental instability; he now takes to drawing a flying sow wearing a cloak bearing the alphabets NEO on it. Of course we all know heâ€™s a big fan of the matrix.   "
7935,4238152,"18,August,2004",2004-08-18,"   By: Nofing  Just today, Ms. Yoong my English teacher for two years posed an interesting question to the class, â€œWhat does marriage mean to you?â€ I, on one of these rare occasions was at a loss for words. So much more when asked to express my opinion to the entire class? Having thought over this issue carefully, I, sad to say still have not come up with a satisfactory answer. When I stood in front of the class, the first thing that came rushing into my mind was, â€œHow am I supposed to make my answer  unconventional ?â€ I thought and thought but nothing not even suggestions from fellow classmates could do the trick. This ranged from, â€œMarriage is the legal consent to have carnal knowledge of someone,â€ to â€œMarriage equals to free sex.â€ In a nutshell, this boils down to a naughty three â€“ letter word â€“ sex. Indeed in this more conservative Asian society of ours, sex is seldom an appropriate topic at the dinner table. However, to equate marriage to sex does seem to be a rather flawed equation. Iâ€™m sure that by reading the aforementioned opinions from  well â€“ meaning  friends, one would doubt the company I mix with. However, before you present the verdict, lets be honest. At the tender age of fifteen, which hot â€“ blooded male would resist the thought of sex; much less a lifetime of free sex? In comparism, if such a question was to be answered by the opposite sex, Iâ€™m sure the response given would have been entirely different. This might (Iâ€™m just guessing) range from, â€œ A sense of security,â€ to â€œeverlasting love.â€ Honestly speaking, which girls wouldnâ€™t want to dwell in such a fantasy, which is seldom possible in this fickle, demanding world? Having explored the possible responses from both genders, one would come to a conclusion that the meaning of marriage goes beyond moral issues but to fundamental ones like the biological make up of men and women alike. I do not claim to be an expert in this area but as far as Iâ€™m concerned, men being more  primitive , will definitely wish to satisfy basic needs before moving on to more complex needs and wants which require greater intellect which is why some men stop at brothels having barely satisfied their basic needs. Women, on the other hand are more sentimental. Apparently, this includes their basic instinct. I mean, itâ€™s the way the human body is designed â€“ do first, talk later. Which is why women would rather be loved emotionally than to have it expressed physically. However, this cannot be said for all women where there are exceptions of women leaving a marriage because the men cannot satisfy their basic needs. Then again, the same can be said for men where the few exceptions also wish to be loved emotionally and the physical aspect need not necessarily come into the picture. My purpose of writing this article isnâ€™t to find the meaning of marriage but to discuss its effectiveness as an â€˜Oâ€™ level examination question. Indeed this was Tuesdayâ€™s â€˜Oâ€™ level English oral examination question. I believe that the purpose of the GCE â€˜Oâ€™ level examinations is meant to test the proficiency of students in various areas of study. However, such a question when probed further goes beyond superficial issues like sex. It requires much thinking before answering not because it takes time to find a satisfactory answer which the examiner will appreciate but also to see if it conflicts with ones beliefs. Being a Christian by faith, I find it hard to provide an  unconventional  answer for such a question. In fact, to come up with a  decent  answer would prove to be a difficult task what more unconventional one! As a Christian, there are many  laws  so to say governing marriage. It is seen as a sacred process, which every Christian should go through only once in a lifetime. Which is why providing answers relating to â€˜one night standsâ€™ and answers of similar nature would not be right. On the contrary, it is stated that men and women are made for each other but to the extent of free sex? That might be testing the limits. I do realize that what I mention here seems to be rather contradictory with regard to my actions. However, one must realize that what I say outside does not go to the point of conflicting with my faith. No matter how â€˜ out of boundsâ€™  my statements may have been, one must realize that it only flirts around the surface, teasing it lightly and that is all. But to answer such a question, even at the best of my ability, my response is as follows. Marriage is the unity of two imperfect humans who regardless of their genders, can live together in harmony and accommodate each otherâ€™s flaws and appreciate them for who they are and not what they are or what they can provide. Marriage is more than an act of love but also a lifetime commitment. In the event of either party being unfaithful, instead of walking the easier route of divorcing, they should take the difficult but permanent route, which should involve professional counseling for both parties and the support of their families. Marriage is another stage in life, which further emphasizes the need for compromise. On a larger scale, this can be put to practice between countries where compromise amongst the parities involved can prevent conflict, which might lead to war. Therefore, marriage is not just an act of love but also a valuable lesson in life. Now, even as a Christian, I must occasionally  forget  myself and therefore the other type of response which if I donâ€™t make mention of, I would certainly live to regret. When two humans in the heat of the moment tie the knot, this is called a shot â€“ gun marriage. Superstars who include Britney Spears have acted out such scenarios. Of course when such an unfortunate incident arises, it will definitely lead to a divorce. However, there is a way around this. It is known as a one â€“ nightstand for the fickle minded and a long â€“ time (platonic) relationship. In both instances, the concept of legality is given a miss and this, might give the couple(s) involved a false sense of security. Whatever the case, it beats polygamy, which as you people should know is against the law. In conclusion, marriage is a must for law â€“ breakers (committing polygamy) who want to have the best of both worlds â€“ sex and breaking the law.     Nofing is still confused and is trying hard to learn a valuable lesson in life (compromise) without getting married. Obviously, he needs to find a balance between the secular world and his religion, which more often than not is impossible.   "
7936,4238152,"18,August,2004",2004-08-18,"   By: Nofing  Iâ€™ve learnt the meaning of standing up for your beliefs. It all happened today. When I had a â€˜baptism of fireâ€™ so to say. It made me realize one thing â€“ being with bad eggs will cause you to turn bad as well. Itâ€™s just so sad that I had to lose friends along the way. But as the old saying goes (or is it my  saying ) gone with the bad in with the good. Whatever the case, Iâ€™ve found out that Iâ€™m still good â€“ At least where my beliefs are concerned. I donâ€™t stand for calling others â€˜fatherless bastardsâ€™; nor disgracing my family or myself; nor being so thick â€“ skinned to the extent of having everyone walk out on you. I had better stop here before things get personal. But as you can see the person in question is none other than Ron. The stinkingâ€¦ â€¦you knowâ€¦ â€¦ Iâ€™m amazed that heâ€™s still around and still acting like as though heâ€™s so cool. I find it getting more and more difficult to write things in perspective but I must try me very best before I disgrace the name of my family and myself. Now looking at things in perspective: Ron to me is a like a pool of water. Heâ€™s always the way people shape him and I will always stand by that. Oh yeah, and did I mention heâ€™s a bully? I canâ€™t help but question his credibility regarding his parentage. You see, humans have something known s a guilt conscience and will pick on others who are in the same boat because, like a smoke â€“ screen, this would draw attention away from themselves. And Ron keeps on picking on Bo Hui and Wai Keat. Why? For the record, Bo Huiâ€™s father died of cancer when Bo Hui was young and Wai Keat has a medical problem. I am not specially mentioning this two extremely pleasant souls to spite them or anything but surely one would see the irony of this all. Having been a friend of Ron for some time, I now know the reason behind his being retained and Iâ€™m none too surprised. In fact, Iâ€™m grateful for him because he has walked the beaten path and I now know how to avoid the same  ending  as him. With every passing word, I am feeling more and more ashamed of myself. Instances of Ron and his unfair treatment towards others have come flooding back. Connections regarding a case, which I missed out, have joined back to complete the jigsaw. I would like to take this opportunity to apologize to those whom I may have mistreated or whom I did not offer help to when Ron unfairly treated them. I also urge all there people to come forward and speak up against such injustice. To put it across bluntly, I do not want the level to be dominated by a  retainee  and his  sidekicks . The sad thing is, many of his so â€“ called â€˜sidekicksâ€™ are in fact fair weather friends. I admit that I was indeed one of them but having straightened my thinking; I can now safely watch Ron destroy himself from afar. Enough of Ron; lets move on to further examine the different characters who â€˜hang outâ€™ with him.  Losers  No hard feelings please; this group of people are the misfits of society and to escape from being picked on by others, they join a group for temporary protection. I pity this group of people the most because their situation is akin to that of choosing between the devil and the deep blue sea.  Manipulators  Like I said earlier, Ron is like a pool of water. This group of people has a measurable intellect and uses this to manipulate Ron for their personal gains. I personally despise this group of people the most. I mean Ron is retained and thatâ€™s no need to further emphasize  this  by making use of him. Then again, he deserves it.  Man on the Street  The man on the street is innocent but finds Ron and company interesting. He or she will â€˜hang outâ€™ with them for a while until he loses interest and leaves the group. Now that the various groups of people who might be associated with Ron have been listed, I must as Mdm. Tang once said, â€œIf you canâ€™t be a solution, donâ€™t be a problem.â€ I shall now attempt to find ways and means to end Ronâ€™s tyranny or more likely the manipulators tyranny. Like I said, the people Ron mixes with define him. So I suggest we place Ron amongst a group of monkeys. As the saying goes, â€œMonkey see; monkey do.â€ In this case, theres nothing for the monkeys to see or do so theyâ€™ll just pass time scratching each other. (Wait! How can they scratch each other if no one teaches them to? But Iâ€™m sure Ron can teach them. After all  monkey see; monkey do .) For the losers, Iâ€™m at a loss for words. They are so pitiful yet at the same time they arenâ€™t exactly the ones whom you would want to interact with usually. So, I propose we send them for an Adam Khoo course and see if they can change their believes. After all, Iâ€™m a loser so are you. Wait a minute that sounds a little wrong doesnâ€™t it? For the manipulators, what can I say? I mean they constantly prey on the inferior lot of people. Therefore, the probable solution would be to isolate them on a far away island like Bali where theyâ€™ll be bombed by the terrorists who apparently are already manipulated by someone else. Like they always say getting a taste of your own medicine. And last but not least, the man on the street. Nothing new here; theyâ€™ll just look around, maybe be part of the group for a period of time before leaving. No harm done but while he or she is at not, why not try manipulating Ron? Its jolly good fun you know? Iâ€™ve said my piece, Iâ€™ve lost a friendship I wished I never had and Iâ€™m glad for that. After all, one should see the way Ronâ€™s  ex  â€“ classmates treat him â€“ with such distaste like as though they had seen something awful like a  garbage bag , which leaves a foul aftertaste.  Nofing has not gotten over this and swears to fight it out with Ron to the end. Unfortunately, the after effects of sublime influence have made themselves known and he now spends his time giving new meanings to the acronym RON. Examples include, â€˜Rotten Old Nigerâ€™ and â€˜Retained Overaged Nitwitâ€™.   "
7937,4238152,"22,August,2004",2004-08-22,"   By: Nofing  We all know of nations fighting over territory. Over  landmarks  like  Pedra Branca , which further extends a nationâ€™s territory. But classes experiencing border crisis? This unusual topic has been tackled by my fellow writer Eric and Iâ€™m here to present yet another case of border crisis. Take a bow Eric. The temporary classroom block if not good for nothing still serves a purpose â€“ rattling the chipboard walls and see how long itâ€™ll be before the partition drops. After all, the whole structure is  temporary  isnâ€™t it? Perhaps more light should be shed on this issue of border crisis. As far as I know, it originated from Anderson, when students who sat near these partitions grew bored of the lesson (which is quite often, ands thatâ€™s saying something) they started throwing their weight against it. This caused the partition to rock violently and thereby disrupting the neighboring classâ€™s lesson. It has proven to be great fun when one side bangs and the other returns the favor. And as humans evolved for the sake of evolution, so has the banging of these partitions. As in order with this yearâ€™s theme â€“ magical, enterprising and wow, Andersonians have taken it to heart. A splendid example would be the mutilation of the partitions. Major Chong is a busy man but recent events have made him busier. You see, holes in these  so â€“ called  walls are a  so â€“ called  eyesore whereas in my opinion, makes the school look more like the  darker  side of LA. Indeed, such a scene is not appealing to everyone but  compromises  must be made right? So, instead of making holes in the wall, students have taken to removing the wall altogether. This in itself is magical â€“ how often do you get to witness such a ceremony? Enterprising â€“ if the school ever needs construction works to rebuild the school, here are some ideal ones. And wow â€“ I mean, wowâ€¦literally; students are really getting the hand of multitasking arenâ€™t they? Now, removing the wall isnâ€™t too difficult. In fact, its part of the cause and effect cycle of banging it. The partition itself is only meant to allocate the space to each class and determine the classâ€™s boundaries. Unlike bomb shelters, these walls are unable to withstand vigorous banging or rocking. And of course, when the glue (can you believe it? The school is so  enterprising . Temporary, really!) is torn apart from the wall, which has already began, the wall will have to fall due to an unstable equilibrium and gravitational forces. And being enterprising students, they must make the best of the fallen wall. So theyâ€™ll see which side has a disliked teacher/student and have the wall fall towards that direction. So far, there have been no incidents of such nature and I sincerely hope so since Iâ€™m sitting next to the wall but as a good student, I would now like to share some of there magical techniques on banging the wall, which will certainly make you, go â€œwowâ€.  Beginnerâ€™s guide to banging the wall  The good â€˜ole wayâ€¦  Simply ram your elbow  ala  a rugby tackle at the wall and marvel at Newtonâ€™s laws and the conservation of energy. Note, this method no matter how macho it makes you feels is ill â€“ advised, as you will feel great discomfort in your elbow the following day.  Knock, knock, whoâ€™s there?  This method was developed by the normal stream of 2002 last year during reading sessions in the hall where they repeatedly slammed their reading materials on the floor much to the supervising teacherâ€™s annoyance. This method has proven to be a hit among passive students who only want to make noise without having any fatalities. Like the normal stream have done, just take a hard object with a decent surface area of preferably 100cm2 and slam it against the wall repeatedly. Guaranteed satisfaction, which will make the DC, that follows more bearable. Last but not leastâ€¦  The retaineeâ€™s methodâ€¦  Yes, yes as a tribute to Ron who started this method, those who wish to follow suit neednâ€™t worry about being retained; obviously, that requires more  skill . This method involves shouting vulgarities at the wall in the belief that sound travels through hard objects faster. Obviously, the nut head hasnâ€™t been doing much reading up ( retained ?) otherwise he would have realized that the wall is make up of chipboard and sponge which doesnâ€™t propagate sound but on the contrary absorbs it. Not to be defeated, there is a plan B. This involves throwing or banging (or a combination of both) either a basketball or chair at the wall. The result would be the students at the other side of the wall retaliate in kind or ask Mr. Ang to witness the event.  A few words of advise before I end this piece and proceed to fine tuning my methods of wall banging, one must realize that at the end of the day, the school is where you receive your education and not where you bang walls. Banging of walls or fellow students should preferably be done outside school.  Nofing has learnt his lesson and has stopped banging the wall. Unfortunately, those nut heads led by Ron on the other side of the wall have not learnt their lesson. He feels that those losers should go bang their heads against a wall or bang someone. She bangs, she bangsâ€¦   "

23443,4239436,"21,August,2004",2004-08-21,"   CSS has really changed web styles. It not only saves time, but you can customize your webpage color schemes to a higher extent. You can also create more professional looking websites just by adding styles to your documents. Today, I will show you a webmaster trick that uses CSS by applying mouseover styles that change as the mouse ""rolls"" over a table's background.     Explanation #1:  Alot of newbies don't know how to do this and so many people have asked me how to do this too, so I've decided to make a tutorial on it. What is suppose to happen is, when you place your mouse over a table row, the style should change to another style you have defined in what we will call "" styles.css "" (external stylesheet).   Create a new file in Notepad and save it as ""styles.css"":       td.On { background: #FF8A00; FONT-FAMILY: verdana; COLOR: #FFFFFF; FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 10px; } td.Off { background: #0056a2; FONT-FAMILY: verdana; COLOR: #FFFFFF; FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 10px; }       Explanation #2:  									 Now that you have your stylesheet you may link it to your html document like so:     &lt;html&gt;    &lt;head&gt;   &lt;link href=""styles.css"" type=""text/css"" rel=""stylesheet""&gt;   &lt;/head&gt;    &lt;body&gt;   &lt;table border=""1"" width=""100%"" bordercolor=""#1C464F""&gt;   &lt;tr&gt;   &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;   &lt;/tr&gt;   &lt;tr&gt;   &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;   &lt;/tr&gt;   &lt;/table&gt;         Explanation #3:  Okay, go get some coffee or something worth while to drink, then come back...WELCOME BACK! Now back to work, the next thing we must do now is create the table like so (without the styles implemented):      &lt;table border=""1"" width=""100%"" bordercolor=""#1C464F""&gt; &lt;tr> &lt;td>The dog ran the race.&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;But the cat won.&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/table&gt;       Explanation #4:  Now you may implement the styles. Note that becasue you attached the stylesheet as and external stylesheet, you can just add the 'class' attribute to your HTML tags and your styles will show up. THIS IS WHERE THE MAGIC IS! What you do is you add the code  onmouseover=""this.className='on'""  and  onmouseout=""this.className='off'""  to make the tables change as the mouse rolls over each row:     &lt;table border=""1"" width=""100%"" bordercolor=""#1C464F""&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td class=""off"" onmouseover=""this.className='on'"" onmouseout=""this.className='off'""&gt; The dog ran the race.&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td class=""off"" onmouseover=""this.className='on'"" onmouseout=""this.className='off'""&gt; But the cat won.&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/table&gt;      Putting It Together:  Now as it is pieced together your HTML document should look something like this:     &lt;html&gt;  &lt;head&gt;    &lt;link href=""styles.css"" type=""text/css"" rel=""stylesheet""&gt; &lt;/head&gt;  &lt;body&gt;   &lt;table border=""1"" width=""100%"" bordercolor=""#1C464F""&gt;     &lt;tr&gt;        &lt;td class=""Off"" onmouseover=""this.className='On'"" onmouseout=""this.className='Off'""&gt; The dog ran the race.        &lt;/td&gt;     &lt;/tr&gt;     &lt;tr&gt;        &lt;td class=""Off"" onmouseover=""this.className='On'"" onmouseout=""this.className='Off'""&gt; But the cat won.     &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/table&gt;  &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt;      urlLink continued story...

23444,4239436,"15,August,2004",2004-08-15,"   PHP auto-redirection is an overlooked concept that many people fear. You should fear nothing because with a single line of code I can show you how to redirect your page to another! It's as simple as  1 - 2 - 3 .     Note:  										 The only precaution to be aware of is the code syntax. The syntax of this small, yet powerful script is very, very code sensitive. There are many single quotes and commas in this script and if you make one typing mistake, then your script will generate errors and you will end up with very unhappy visitors.

23445,4239436,"15,August,2004",2004-08-15,"   PHP incorporates powerful and fast date and time functionality. In this article Ryan gives us the low down on PHP's various functions to manipulate the time and date with ease. Today's web sites try to offer a wide variety of useful data and information to the viewer. This is often what makes a web site more appealing than flashy graphics and cheesy animations. In fact, sometimes it is the attention to subtle detail that helps the web developer take that extra step into making a site appear more professional.    One simple way to add a professional detail to your web site is to post the current date and time within your web page. As insignificant as this might sound, it is a very commonly used way to show visitors that your site is slightly ahead of the curve. 										 The following basic PHP tutorial will show you how to use a few PHP functions to retrieve date and time information from your web server and display them neatly on your web site.   We Have A  										Problem:  No matter which operating system you are running your web server and PHP on, the procedure for gathering the current date and time is the same. The first problem is that the returned value is fairly cryptic.  									For example, the following PHP code:      &lt;?php    echo   time  ();   ?&gt;     Will quickly  										translate into:       Also Note: 	 Though this may not be very user friendly, it is an accurate measure of the date and time. This numeric date and time format originates from the fact that all Unix servers tell time by counting the number of seconds that have passed since 12:00 a.m. on January 1, 1970. All we need to do is learn how to display the above information in a way that makes sense to our site visitors.   Fixing The Problem:  Using PHP to convert the Unix timestamp into something more understandable is just a matter of employing the proper function. This tutorial will cover the use of a variety of basic functions available for this task.  The most commonly used function is date(). As you might expect, this function is fairly customizable. Customization is achieved through PHP's recognition of a variety of characters submitted in the format string. Below are just a few common characters, for a complete list of them, visit the PHP   						 urlLink  documentation   website.       D: day of the week     F: the month     h: hour, 12-hour format     H: hour, 24-hour format     i: minutes     l: day of the week     Y: year     										If we combine some of this knowledge into  										PHP code, the following:        &lt;        ?php    echo   date  (  ""l F d Y h:i""   ,  time  ());   ?       &gt;       										Should give a result similar to:    Monday August Mon 2004 03:42    Conclusion:  Obviously this makes considerably more sense than the previous Unix timestamp. The result could be further improved through the addition of punctuation. When additional text is introduced into the format string it is important to remember to use a backslash to comment it out. Otherwise, your text will be recognized as part of the special character string.   urlLink continued story...  "
23446,4239436,"15,August,2004",2004-08-15,"   Hello Everyone! Hope everything is well. I have decided to put together an article that has to do with XHTML (HTML). After seeing way to many sites using frames   incorrectly .     Introduction  In Web Design and web technologies, there is always a correct and an incorrect way of doing something. Throughout my time as a webmaster I have seen good ways and bad ways to use frames. Personally, I do not use frames at all anymore. To me they are a hassle and somewhat, in my book, depreciated. This article, though, is not for me, but for you to be informed about the wonderful world of web design and multimedia. So come along for the information! 										 										 What Is A Frame Made Of?  										There are two parts of a frame.  There  										are the  frame(s)  and there is the 										 frameset . In small words, a   										 frameset   is the primary page that holds all the ""frame"" pages together into one document and implements the actual frames into the document. Slightly different, a   frame   (or frames) are the actual pages that contain HTML and/or other scripting/programming that form the whole page. So think of a frameset as a placeholder and a frame as the objects. 										 										A frameset document is a document that defines  										one or more frames by using the    frameset    										and    frame   elements. 										 										 So, What's The Advantage?  The advantage to frames is you can present multiple documents into one browser window. For example, you could make a frameset(index.html) and add the following page: a frame on the left side(nav.html) and assign the page links for your navigation links for your website. Then you may have a frame at the top of your document(header.html) inserting an image to make it look like your logo top header part of your site. Then you could make a body frame(body.html) and assign it as the target for your links so that your links target display into the body.html frame. This can get confusing if you don't do this yourself. But this is the only advantage to frames. 										 										 Yeah, But What Exactly Is The  										Disadvantage?  										The disadvantage to frames is the  										following: 										 										 										      From browser to browser (IE, NN, Opera, Mozilla, and Firefox) they don't display the same way causing your users to get annoyed or confused and they click out of your site.       Frame size has a huge factor too. People have different screen resolutions(800 X 600, 1024 X 768, and 1280 X 1024) and frames don't calculate right making your users have to scroll back and forth.       Some browsers (most anyway), do not support the fact of printing. Many web browsers just print out a certain page, but not the whole page the user is seeing. It could be the links page, or the body page, or even the header page.       Search engines have a hard time getting a correct search. Like if your site was a frameset and had all the pages as stated above, and you went to Google and searched for your site: You click the link for your site and all you get is this page of links. The user is confused and clicks out having a bad, very bad opinion about your site. And you as a web designer is displeased, because you have no, or almost no visitors.       Finally, the last, but certainly not least reason why frames are a dying tool, is the fact that tables are a whole lot cleaner. You can format and display information much better in tables rather than in frames.       										 										 Conclusion  That concludes my thoughts on frames and I really hope this article was helpful. An to make something very clear, when frames are used correctly, great things can happen. Check out    urlLink Microsoft's MSDN    										website.     urlLink continued story...  "
23447,4239436,"15,August,2004",2004-08-15,"   I have been looking into Flash and its design concepts. Most are great, but only if used correctly and not ""too much"". There is a right way of going the flash path, and of course, a wrong way.     Introduction   I am starting to see more and more sites made in Flash (now Flash 7 (MX)). So what I did was I started looking into Flash and designed a few idealistic programs/working models. What I came to find out was that Flash isn't exactly the best thing for a website. Don't get me wrong. I designed a few web apps using actionscript and such and exported a Flash file, but it isn't (in my opinion) the best way to make a site look good.   Web Browsers   Web browsers are starting to support Flash more and more, but the thing about Flash is that it is very limited in user ability. I have seen very, very good flash sites, and unfortunately, very bad ones. The Flash sites that present themselves are the ones that are very interactive with help situations and vector graphics.   The Good & The Bad Ones  The other day I saw a site made with 100% flash and it was very hard to get around, because the designer didn't make his site user-friendly, thus I did not know what to do. He didn't have a ""Home"" button and it was just horrible. On another note, I have seen amazing Flash sites and have been caught in awe and amazement of what you can do with Flash and web animation interactivity. It had buttons, polls, interfaces, downloads, and everything preloaded making it very slick, fast, and flawless.   Too Much?   Flash really is a great program and a huge revolution in the web design industry, but like with anything else; it can be overused. I'm not saying that after about a million sites we should stop using Flash. What I am trying to get across is that 100% complete Flash sites can be very, very bad. Not all web browsers support Flash, and, as with any other program can malfunction at anytime leaving the user feel unwanted or disgusted with your site. Too much Flash can also be upsetting in the fact that not a lot of people are used to it and don't know exactly how to take it. As stated above, to make a Flash site better, add some help documentation in HTML format to keep the user in control not the program.   Alternatives   There are many alternatives to Flash and actually alternatives to help using Flash and HTML together. One of the best things on a Flash site I have seen is a home page splash option. What this does is it allows a person viewing the home page of a website to choose between a ""Flash"" version of the site or the ""HTML"" (HTML & CSS) version of the website. The helps the older browser and the ignorant/new people in the computer age. Another way to get away from flash is to try other web languages such as C#, Visual Basic, ASP, and my favorite, PHP/MySQL.   Conclusion   As Flash may spark your interest, you should know the good and the bad of everything. Flash is good in some aspect, but don't overuse it. If it is overused people will get tired and there can be extreme consequences. Have fun with your website and happy coding!  urlLink continued story...  "

14356,4240336,"21,August,2004",2004-08-21,"   Tomorrow's the Nightwish show.  And after throwing the idea around of maybe meeting the band, in the end it's going back to the original plan of just seeing the show.  We're probably gonna get their around 3, and we'll end up meeting Rod and all his friends.  Which reminds me, I must tell Niki when the train is.  I'm becoming  very  paranoid over when this whole thing will end.  The last train is 12:37.  It can't end a  second  later than 12 midnight or we're fucked.  I just realized how else we'll be fucked since on the Nightwish forum there's talk on how the show is probably oversold.  It only holds about 1000.  If we get caught in the middle  A) that would suck lol   and  b) we'd be stuck.  I need to talk to Niki.  She's not online right now though.  I hope she feels well.           Anyway after that on Monday we leave for Massachusettes (hence why I MUST get home).  So I won't be updating for awhile.  I get a break from using the internet =D           Now off to find Niki.  We really need to plan this better :/   "
14357,4240336,"19,August,2004",2004-08-19,"   I know, I'm getting  very  ahead of myself when talking about Halloween, but Katy got my mind thinking.  She said something about us all hanging out for Halloween.  Then someone mentioned something about dressing up.  And that's when I decided, I shall pull the Steve Harris thing =P  Plus, I just realized, AG said he's trying to come up in October.  If I remember correctly, he said around the last week in October.  So maybe he can do the metal thing with me??? I think I can pull off the Steve Harris thing :p  It's the hair - I can do it with my hair.  I just need a jacket (lether one possibly) and find cloths close to what he is very notable for whereing like from a tour or something.  Then I need something that looks like a bass guitar and a strap close to his.  Hm....looks like I got some planning to do with that strap :/  And some sewing =D   "
14358,4240336,"18,August,2004",2004-08-18,"   I've just gotten disappointed one too many times.  AG knows it...he's the only one that understands.  I wish he still lived up here.  Then I'd feel better.  Sucks that he's out there.  I may be forced to move out there now.  I just can't wait to leave here now.  I really can't.  I just want to  leave.   Never come back.  AG understands me, and Tennessee is a Republican state.  I should really live there.  I hate it here.   "
14359,4240336,"16,August,2004",2004-08-16,"   I met Laura from the IMBB today =) She's so nice!! I'm so glad I got to see her! We were talking about the Rush concert and a bit about the Dance of Death tour. Then we started talking about the Crew and how she wants to basically get me and Bryan in to chill with them all at Twins Pub before Nicko's show. That would be great. She said she doesn't see a problem in them letting us in, as long as we don't drink. She figured this since the show is all ages for one, and one of the other guys on the BB, LordIffy I think she said it was, is actually bringing his kids to the show so he's gonna bring them to the Pre-show get together at Twins. I hope Bryan doesn't mind hanging out with them at Twins. If he doesn't want to, then we'll hang out together longer, and then we'll just wait for them all at about 8-ish outside of Twins and we can all walk to Time Sq together. This is gonna be so great!!! Laura's so amazingly awesome and I can tell the rest of the Crew is too =) I feel so special since they don't mind that we're are 17 and don't mind hanging out with us. They're all so great and loving.  I love Iron Maiden fans [heart]   "
14360,4240336,"16,August,2004",2004-08-16,"   Sorry about not updating yesterday.  Yesterday I worked from 10-6 and then I went over to Sara's house for her birthday.  I didn't get home till about 11PM.  Sara got her license though, I'm very happy for her =)  For her birthday, we went to Red Heads, then we went to play pool.  Lauren and I lost the first game, but we won the second game and I got the shot =)  Whooo I felt special.  Wish I had a pool table to play on -_-              Other than that, I feel kinda...like I'm fading.  Just fading from people.  I was thinking this earlier but then I realized that I didn't update from yesterday -doh- so I decided to put these both in one entry.  I feel like I'm still close to  my friends, but on the other hand, not as important to them anymore.  Maybe I'm not -_-  I'm disappointed in myself for letting it get like that though -_-         And I also think I gained weight again this week.  Some of my cloths didn't really fit yesterday.  I'm disappointed in myself for that two.  If only my fat would fade away like how I feel I'm fading away from some of my friends, that would be great =D  Should just switch the situations.  -sigh-         On a happy note, I think Laura from the IMBB is gonna come and visit me today =D  We've been planning this all summer and I think it's finally gonna happen today.  I can't wait to finally meet her.  Then I get to see her in Sept at the McBrain Damage show.  Yay.              I guess that's all.  Oh, wait....lemme say one thing:      About the friend thing, I'm not  trying  to drift from any of you.  I just feel as if I'm not really there with you anymore :/  I feel left out, or just not wanted if I'm talking to you.  I'm not saying I don't want to be friends with you, because I do.   "
14361,4240336,"16,August,2004",2004-08-16,"   As I'm sitting here having a bit of an artist block (or just pressured to use my extra paint) I think I should type up what happened today at work.           I was at work from 10-6.  Maren was coming in at 5 so I could get off the register for my last hour and do the put-backs.  At about 430PM I was alone at the register while Heather was in the foyer.  She was looking out the front door while trying to put up a sign.  She turns around and goes to me, ""there's a clown in a wheelchair in the parking lot"".  I just looked at her with that ""what are you talking about"" look upon my face.  I'm thinking it's one of those things when there's business and they want to promote something, they have someone dress up in an animal suit or something with the promotion.  It wasn't.  Here's how our conversation went:      Heather: There's a clown in a wheelchair in the parking lot   Me (I just have that look on my face): What?   Heather: There's a clown, in a wheelchair, in the parking lot      (At this point I leave the register (like there's anyone there anyways) and I go look out the front door).      Sure enough, there was a man (fat man might I add) in a yellow clown suit, in an electric wheelchair coming toward the store.  I wish I thought of taking my phone out earlier than I did (I have a camera phone) because when I thought of it, he was getting a little too close to the door and I didn't want him to see me take a picture of him.  Now I really regret not doing it.      Heather and I then run back to my register, and Heather tells Robyn to dial my register.  By this time, the clown was in the foyer of the store.  We can't hold back the laugher, we start laughing.  I never saw Heather laugh so hard in my life till this very moment.      Robyn calls my register.      Heather then tries to say, ""there's a clown in a wheelchair in the store"" but fails to do it due to laughter.  You can tell Robyn asked, ""what?"" through the phone because Heather tried to repeat it.  She was laughing  so  hard that she actually passed the phone to me and went ""do you wanna tell her?""  I was laughing so hard myself that I couldn't so I just shook my head.  Finally Heather was able to gather herself so she could tell Robyn.        Later Robyn comes up to the register (and by now the clown is just in the store somewhere) so Heather could ring her up.  I could tell Heather was trying to talk about the clown.  And now at this time, I had customers.  I don't know why...but when I heard Heather try to explain it again to Robyn, I started laughing.  I started laughing the second I saw Robyn come toward the registers because I knew Heather would tell her.  I'm sure the two customers on my line probably thought I was crazy.  Since I was laughing at nothing, through their eyes.           People, you don't see this everyday.  You don't see a clown, in an electric wheelchair, go through the parking lot and come into your store.  You might have seen weird things...but in my 4 months of being at the Rag Shop, I never saw such a thing.  I'm still getting a kick outta it.  I'm still amused and I'm still laughing at the thought.  It was definitely funny.  Maren laughed too when I asked if she saw him when she came in.  I didn't even have to  finish  my sentence.  She did for me.  It was great.  Him coming up through the parking lot to the front door is one of those things that are scarred in ones memory for life.            No, I wasn't on drugs, nor am I on them right at this moment.  This actually happened.   "
14362,4240336,"15,August,2004",2004-08-15,"   I'm starting to have that feeling where I don't belong again. Prolly the age thing. Or probably because of the person that I am, I really  don't  belong anywheres. Maybe that's just me though. I'm sure people will fight with me with this feeling. They'd just be like ""that's how you're supposed to feel at 17""and all that bullshit. That's all my mom ever gives me. Like that day she decided to  lecture  me on life and crap. And how I have to do better in school. And then she went, ""life isn't easy"" so I just went ""Whatever. I hate life then"". I think I really do. I find no purpose. It's to feel like this till you're like...21 or 22, then probably feel like this again once you're outta college and can't find what to do with your life because you're life just failed you and you can't find a career that you've been looking for for years. So life really isn't that grand. I hate it already.   "
14363,4240336,"15,August,2004",2004-08-15,"   You know what, fuck it.  It's not worth it.  Nothing is anymore.  Right now, I just wanna talk to either Lauren, or Susan.  The only two people who'd fucking understand.   "
14364,4240336,"15,August,2004",2004-08-15,"   Today was a lazy day really. Kinda. I had to go food shopping, which wasn't that bad since I bought a lot of shit (never go food shopping when you're hungry =x), then my dad took me to CD World. I really should have driven myself....all well. I hate driving. Anyways - I got 2 cds. I got Rush - Vapor Trails and I got Symphony X - V. I like the Symphony X so far =) Then I came home and I ordered some shirts. I got a Symphony X one (it has the masks on it...it's from their official site) then I got an Opeth shirt, and 2 Iced Earth shirts =] I can't wait to get them. I spent almost 87$ on band T's =X That'll suck once the bill comes.       Now tomorrow I have to work. Yuck. I gotta wake up at 830AM for the next (and last) 4 days. I was gonna hang out with Sara tomorrow night after work, but I'm really not sure now. I may tell her we'll just hang out Thursday night since that would be my last day. If we hang out tomorrow, I wouldn't get to bed till  probably  1030/1045. I don't go to sleep right away. Usually I'm up for about an hour once I lay down in bed. So, if I go to bed at 1030, I'll hopefully fall asleep by 1130 and get 9 hrs of sleep. That's if I don't have a problem sleeping in the night :/ Blah. I hate sleep. And yet, every morning when I wake up I just think about going back to bed at the end of the day >P       Now I'm just rambling. So I'm gonna go.   "
14365,4240336,"15,August,2004",2004-08-15,"   I decided to come back to blogger.  Only because I just want a simple journal site.  The other journal sites make things too complicated ><>!!   For fair warning:  I will speak my mind without caring about what others may think when reading it.  This is my little blogger so I'm gonna say my own little thoughts.  Just fair warning =)   I won't always rant and rave about debatable,  controversial little topics but I may if I get frustrated enough about something.  So I guess I shall update later =)   "
24407,4242609,"22,August,2004",2004-08-22,"   Tonight I watched the Jets roll all over the Colts in their 2nd preseason game.  Chad Pennington played great, completing 10 of 11 passes and throwing for 150+ yards and a touchdown.  I really hope they get him signed to a contract extension soon.  Besides that, the first team didn't look that great.  The run defense sucked, and looked mostly the same as the last 3 years.  We were playing what might be the best offense in the NFL though, so it's not time to panic.  The Jets shutdown Manning with the exception of one big play to Reggie Wayne.  On the Colts opening drive Abraham hit Manning from the blind side, slowing down his pass and allowing Donnie Abraham to pick it off in the endzone.  Decent performance, and it's good that we are halfway through the preseason without any major injuries.  I can't wait to see this offense once Moss and Chrebet get on the field.  BTW, the following still suck: -The Jets backup QB's - Team USA Basketball -The Dolphins  "
24408,4242609,"20,August,2004",2004-08-20,"   Since my last post, Team USA has actually won a couple of games. First, they beat Greece. I watched it, and once again they couldn't shoot for shit. When did Richard Jefferson get this bad? Luckily Lamar Odom bailed them out with a bunch of big plays on defense.  Then, today they beat Australia. I didn't see the game, but from what I heard, we actually played really well in the 2nd half. Looking at the boxscore, Iverson, Duncan, and Marion played really well. Seems like Wade played good too, and Richard Jefferson only took 3 shots. It would be nice if we actually played a complete game, but hopefully the winning continues.  The Yankees Pitching has been scary, and not in a good way. I don't think there is one pitcher on their roster who you can be confident in to pitch good in the playoffs. At this point, El Duque might be our best pitcher. Mussina is back, but he struggled in his first start back, and hadn't exactly been tearing it up before he went on the DL. Kevin Brown has been pretty good, but not great, and not consistent at all. Same with Vazquez. Lieber put together a couple of good starts in a row, but I'm not counting on that continuing. Loaiza has been consistent. Consistently giving up 4-5 runs a game while pitching only 5 or 6 innings. That isn't going to cut it. If all our pitchers get hot at the same time, we could still go all the way. Otherwise, it might be an early exit for the 2nd time in 3 years.  That's all I really have to say now. I did add a counter on the bottom of the page to see how many people actually read this shit. I'll probably write again after the Jets preseason game this Saturday vs. the Colts.  "
24409,4242609,"15,August,2004",2004-08-15,"   The Jets had their preseason opener on Friday. Here are my thoughts:     Chad Pennington looked very good, as usual    Curtis Martin is a lot more healthy than in years past, he will have a very good year    Vilma is a beast. He better be in the starting lineup by the time the season starts    The first string defense looked good as a whole. Of course, they were facing a backup QB, and Duece McCallister only had about 2 carries. Next Saturday's game against the Colts will be a much bigger test.    If Pennington gets hurt, I will kill myself. Brooks Bollinger is awful. Ricky Ray looks even worse so far. Hopefully one of them will step it up soon     The Yankees continue to roll along. I'm happy that we are playing so well and probably have our best team since 98, but it would be nice to be in a close playoff race for once. With a 10.5 game lead over Boston, and a 10 game lead over Oakland for homefield advantage in the playoffs, there doesn't appear to be much to get excited about until October. At least there are some other good races though. The AL Central, AL West, and both wildcards should go right down to the wire.    Team USA Basketball is a joke. Whether we lose the rest of our games, or win the gold, I really don't care. This team is boring to watch. If we win in a blowout, it's because we are supposed too, and are on a different level than the rest of the countries. If we win in a close game, it isn't exciting, it usually means we played like shit and were lucky to pull it out. And then when we lose in a blowout like today, it's just a total disgrace. I'm tired of just trying to put an all star team together. Find guys who fit what the team is trying to do. Or better yet, forget the NBA, and right after college season ends assemble a team full of college players. It will leave more time to practice, and will give us team basketball, instead of 12 superstars running around heaving up shots and turning the ball over. Maybe then, by the next olympics I'll watch more basketball than badminton.  "
24410,4242609,"15,August,2004",2004-08-15,"   Here is my blog where I will post all my thoughts about all the stuff I like, and maybe some other shit too.

Sometimes I might update more than once a day, sometimes I might go a couple of weeks. It all depends what I feel like doing.  Enjoy.  "
16361,4256858,"14,February,2001",2001-02-14,"   Once upon a time,There lived a king. The King had abeautiful daughter, the Princess. But the kingdom was a sad place.There was no laughter, and no joy.The problem was, that everything the Princess touched would melt.No matter what, metal, wood, plastic .. .. anything she touched would melt!! Because of this, men were afraid of her.Nobody would dare marry her.The king despaired.What could he do to help his beautiful daughter?He consulted his wizards and magicians. One wizard told the king, ""If yourdaughter touches one thing thatdoes not melt in her hands, shewill be cured."" The King was overjoyed. The nextday, he held a competition. Any manwho could bring his daughter anobject that would not melt at hertouch, would marry her and inheritthe King's wealth. Three young princes took up the challenge. The first Prince brought a very hardalloy of titanium.When the Princess touched it, itmelted. The Prince went away sadly. The second Prince brought a hugediamond, thinking that diamond isthe hardest substance in the worldand will not melt. But, alas, once the Princess touchedit, it melted. He too went away disappointed.

16362,4256858,"02,April,2001",2001-04-02,"   TRUE STORY....  AFTER A FEW OF THE USUAL SUNDAY EVENING HYMNS, THE CHURCH'S PASTOR SLOWLY STOOD UP, WALKED OVER TO THE PULPIT AND, BEFORE HE GAVE HIS SERMON FOR THE EVENING, BRIEFLY INTRODUCED A GUEST MINISTER WHO WAS IN THE SERVICE THAT EVENING.  IN THE INTRODUCTION, THE PASTOR TOLD THE CONGREGATION THAT THE GUEST MINISTER WAS ONE OF HIS DEAREST CHILDHOOD FRIENDS AND THAT HE WANTED HIM TO HAVE A FEW MOMENTS TO GREET THE CHURCH AND SHARE WHATEVER HE FELT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE FOR THE SERVICE. WITH THAT, AN ELDERLY MAN STEPPED UP TO THE PULPIT AND BEGAN TO SPEAK.  ""A FATHER, HIS SON, AND A FRIEND OF HIS SON WERE SAILING> OFF THE PACIFIC COAST,"" HE BEGAN, ""WHEN A FAST APPROACHING STORM BLOCKED ANY ATTEMPT TO GET BACK TO THE SHORE. THE WAVES WERE SO HIGH, THAT EVEN THOUGH THE FATHER WAS AN EXPERIENCED SAILOR, HE COULD NOT KEEP THE BOAT UPRIGHT AND THE THREE WERE SWEPT INTO THE OCEAN AS THE BOAT CAPSIZED.""  THE OLD MAN HESITATED FOR A MOMENT, MAKING EYE CONTACT WITH TWO TEENAGERS WHO WERE, FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE THE SERVICE BEGAN, LOOKING SOMEWHAT INTERESTED IN HIS STORY.  THE AGED MINISTER CONTINUED WITH HIS STORY, ""GRABBING A RESCUE LINE, THE FATHER HAD TO MAKE THE MOST EXCRUCIATING DECISION OF HIS LIFE: TO WHICH BOY HE WOULD THROW THE OTHER END OF THE LIFE LINE. HE ONLY HAD SECONDS TO MAKE THE DECISION. THE FATHER KNEW THAT HIS SON WAS A CHRISTIAN AND HE ALSO KNEW THAT HIS SON'S FRIEND WAS NOT.  THE AGONY OF HIS DECISION COULD NOT BE MATCHED BY THE TORRENT OF WAVES. ""AS THE FATHER YELLED OUT, 'I LOVE YOU, SON!' HE THREW OUT THE LIFE LINE TO HIS SON'S FRIEND.  BY THE TIME THE FATHER HAD PULLED THE FRIEND BACK TO THE CAPSIZED BOAT, HIS SON HAD DISAPPEARED BENEATH THE RAGING SWELLS INTO THE BLACK OF NIGHT. HIS BODY WAS NEVER RECOVERED.""  BY THIS TIME, THE TWO TEENAGERS WERE SITTING UP STRAIGHT IN THE PEW, ANXIOUSLY WAITING FOR THE NEXT WORDS TO COME OUT OF THE OLD MINISTER'S MOUTH.  ""THE FATHER,"" HE CONTINUED, ""KNEW HIS SON WOULD STEP INTO ETERNITY WITH JESUS AND HE COULD NOT BEAR THE THOUGHT OF HIS SON'S FRIEND STEPPING INTO AN ETERNITY WITHOUT JESUS. THEREFORE, HE SACRIFICED HIS SON TO SAVE THE SON'S FRIEND.  HOW GREAT IS THE LOVE OF GOD THAT HE SHOULD DO THE SAME FOR US.  OUR HEAVENLY FATHER SACRIFICED HIS ONLY BEGOTTEN SON THAT WE COULD BE SAVED.  I URGE YOU TO ACCEPT HIS OFFER TO RESCUE YOU AND TAKE A HOLD OF THE LIFE LINE HE IS THROWING OUT TO YOU IN THIS SERVICE.""  WITH THAT, THE OLD MAN TURNED AND SAT BACK DOWN IN HIS CHAIR> AS SILENCE FILLED THE ROOM.  THE PASTOR AGAIN WALKED SLOWLY TO THE PULPIT AND DELIVERED A BRIEF SERMON WITH AN INVITATION AT THE END. HOWEVER, NO ONE RESPONDED TO THE APPEAL. WITHIN MINUTES AFTER THE SERVICE ENDED, THE TWO TEENAGERS WERE AT THE OLD MAN'S SIDE.  ""THAT WAS A NICE STORY,"" POLITELY STATED ONE OF THE BOYS, ""BUT I DON'T THINK IT WAS VERY REALISTIC FOR A FATHER TO GIVE UP HIS ONLY SON'S LIFE IN HOPES THAT THE OTHER BOY WOULD BECOME A CHRISTIAN.""  ""WELL, YOU'VE GOT A POINT THERE,"" THE OLD MAN REPLIED, GLANCING DOWN AT HIS WORN BIBLE. A BIG SMILE BROADENED HIS NARROW FACE, HE ONCE AGAIN LOOKED UP AT THE BOYS AND SAID, ""IT SURE ISN'T VERY REALISTIC, IS IT? BUT I'M STANDING HERE TODAY TO TELL YOU THAT STORY GIVES ME A GLIMPSE OF WHAT IT MUST HAVE BEEN LIKE FOR GOD TO GIVE UP HIS SON FOR ME.  YOU SEE --- I WAS THAT FATHER AND YOUR PASTOR IS MY SON'S FRIEND.""  "
16363,4256858,"24,June,2002",2002-06-24,"   Dati mo na syang kakilala. Lumalabas kayo pero hindi date yun ha. Wala lang. kain lang sa labas, kwentuhan lang. Walang katapusang kakatext. Namumulubi ka na nga kasi magka-iba ang provider nyo. Naiirita ka kung ang tagal ng reply nya, kaya kahit alam mong wala ka pang pambili ng load tatawagan mo sya. Napipikon ka na sa provider mo kaya para masaya,nagpa-sim swap ka. Pag malungkot ka, bad trip, naiirita kahit pa ata bente pesos na lang yung natitirang load mo, tatawagan mo sya. Wala lang. Basta ang alam mo lang you want that person to be there with you. Emote! Naguguluhan ka. Hindi kasi sya katropa. Conflicting ang interest nya tsaka ng mga friends mo. Pero kapag niyaya ka nya kahit na sino pang magtampo sasama ka. Then, katampuhan kayo. Hindi mo na sya kinausap at pinanindigan naman ng loko. Hurt ka syempre. INIYAKAN MO, ITINULOG, IKINAIN.Pero NANGITIAN KA LANG OK NA. Ngayon magkasama na kayo ulit. As if naman may choice ka. Kahit ayaw mo kunyari wala ka namang magagawa. Tamang-tama broken-hearted ka. Litong-lito. Since ok na kayo,lumalabas ulit kayo. Gaya ng dati, wala lang kain lang ulit sa labas,kwentuhan. Ngayon mas kilala nyo na ang isa't-isa. Alam na nya halos lahat ng tungkol sa'yo. Alam nyo kung bad trip ang isat-isa. Alam nyo kung nalulungkot o nag-eemote yung isa. You still have your misunderstanding tsaka tampuhan pero this time after the tampuhan, syemps babawi na kayo sa isat-isa. Sweet nyo noh? Grabe na ito! Takbuhan mo na sya ngayon kung may problema ka. Naikwento mo na lahat ng sama ng loob mo, mga bagay na hindi mo masabi dun sa lalaking iniyakan mo. Unang-una dahil iba ang kasama nya at hindi mo sya makausap ng matino.Bukod pa dun sa parati na lang kayong nag-aaway nung iniyakan mo pag nag-uusap kayo. Pero this one,comfortable ang feeling nyo with each other. Sweet kayo kahit para syo hindi. You actually have your breakfast together at hindi lang yun, you share the same cup of coffee pa. Pinagtitimpla mo sya ng coffee at ginagawa mo para sa kanya yung hindi mo magawa para dun sa iniiyakan mong may kasamang iba. RING!!!! Oops phone call para sa kanya. siginificant other nya. Bakit ka namumula? Magpaapekto ba. Selos ka noh? BAKIT. KAYO BA??? Hindi naman diba! Concentrate. Deep breathing..... Inhale.... Exhale..... Kaya mo yan. Focus.Try to look back. Ano ang nakikita mo? Sino ang iniisip mo? SIYA. Hindi ba dapat yung iniiyakan mo nung nakaraang buwan lang? Syet! You are starting to realize how cool this person is. Syeter! You are beginning to doubt you're feelings dun sa sinabihan mong mahal mo. Syetest! Pero knowing you, idedeny mo na you are actually starting to feel something for this person. What 'dja gonna do? But of course, alamin mo kung friends lang ba kayo.How the hell are you going to find out? Aha! Go to the person and ask it right to their face. ""Gusto mo ba ako?"" Grabe, as if puwede.Do you have the guts to do it? Do it. I'm right behind you, theoretically speaking. Eniwey, you still have the option of whether you would like to know or not. Think. Think hard. Super malambing siya sa iyo pero... Alam mo naman na ganun din sya sa iba. Eh wala naman palang problema eh! Eh bat ka pa apektado???? Sabagay hindi kita masisi kung bakit. Lalo na nung he starts humming love songs (pamilyar di ba? parang yung kakilala mo.), starts asking you funny questions. Like... ""What would you do if a guy na hindi mo masyado kilala asks you out for a date?""Ikaw pa ang tinanong. Eh di ba sumama ka nga sa kanya. Remember...nag-aalangan ka pa nga nun kze hindi mo pa sya ganun kakilala. Kung sino-sino na nga binulabog mo para pagtanungan kung papayag ka. Now he starts asking you about certain situations. ""Pano kung niyaya kang manood ng sine at hinawakan ang kamay mo. Ano daw ang reaksyon mo?"" Sabay patong ng kamay nya sa kamay mo. Dramatization kung baga. Nanlalamig ka at kinakabahan, hindi dahil sa tanong syempre noh.Yun na yun.Sinagot mo syempre. Sabi mo tatanungin mo kung para san yun syempre. ""Eh pano kung hinawakan na talaga?"" Sabay hawak sa kamay mo, holding hands na this time. Syempre nanlalamig ka na at ninenerbyos. Sabi mo, ""ok lang magkaibigan naman ata sila eh"". ""Eh pano kung I-kiss ka?"" Sabi mo, ""What for?"" Thank you daw for the wonderful evening..ek ek.Sabi mo ""Ah ok....basta sa pisngi lang ha. Kasi pag sa lips na masyado nang intimate yun. di ba?"" Eh pano daw kung hindi nagpaalam tapos kiniss ka sa lips? Stolen kiss daw. ""Aba loko noh?! As if naman merong magtatangka"".Then he answers you ""Ako, I would!"" SOOOOOOWWWWWSSSSSSS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Tapos nanood na nga kayo ng sine.Medyo biyolente yung eksena. Takot ka syempre. tinatakpan mo yung mata mo ng kamay mo. Inaalis naman nya. Kinakagat mo yung mga kuko mo. Inaalis pa rin nya yung kamay mo. Kinuha nya tapos pinatong nya yung braso nya para hindi mo na makuha. Ayaw mong paawat kaya yung kanan naman. Sumuko, binitiwan yung kaliwang kamay mo.Kinagat mo ulit yung kuko mo sa daliri mo kze natatakot ka. Kinuha nya ulit yung kamay mo. Hindi rin makulit no? Agaw trip ba? Akala mo hahawakan lang. Aba ang loko, nakikagat sa kuko mo. Ano ba yan????? NO MALICE???? NO MALICE.... Ang gulo noh???? Tutuksuhin ka dun sa lalaking sinabi mong mahal mo. Titingnan yung reaksyon mo.Pag ikaw naman ang kusang nagkwento, iirapan ka tapos tatalikuran na. PAMBIHIRA. Men..... Hayaan daw syang tumulong para makalimutan mo na yung lalaking iniiyakan mo. Feel mo nagbibiro lang..... hmmmm nagbibiro nga lang ba? Ayaw mong bigyan ng malisya lahat ng nagyayari sa inyo kasi magkaibigan kayo tsaka alam naman nya na inlove ka. Pa rin? Eh bat ka nalilito ngayon kung mahal mo nga yung sinabihan mong mahal mo. Mahal mo pa nga ba??? Eh ba't hindi mo na masagot yan ngayon? Ano akala ko ko ba dati mas pipiliin mo yung lalaking mahal mo. Eh bat nag-iba ata ang ihip ng hangin. Mas gusto mo na ngayon yung mahal ka. Hindi lang sa salita kundi sa gawa. WALA LANG TALAGA YANG LAGAY NA YAN HA??? AAWW SHUT UP!  "
16364,4256858,"25,December,2002",2002-12-25,"   Please don't drink and drive, someone cares about you!! ........the true meaning of christmas and all year around...  This has gone around before, but it is well worth sharingagain. Please read,, this hits very close to home On the last day before Christmas, I hurried to go to thesupermarket to buy the remaining of the gifts I didn'tmanage to buy earlier. When I saw all the people there, I started to complain to myself,It is going to take forever here and I still have so many otherPlaces to go.  Christmas really is getting more and more annoying everyyear.How I wish I could just lie down, go to sleep and only wake upafter ...Nonetheless, I made my way to the toy section, and thereI started to curse the prices, wondering if after all kids really playwith such expensive toys.While looking in the toy section, I noticed a small boy of about 5 yearsOld, pressing a doll against his chest. He kept on touching the hairof the doll and looked so sad. I wondered who this doll was for. Then thelittle boy turned to the old woman next to him:""Granny, are you sure I donthave enough money?""The old lady replied: ""You know that you dont have enough money to buythis doll, my dear.""Then she asked him to stay there for 5 minutes whileshe went to look around. She left quickly. The little boy was still holding the doll in is hand.Finally, I started to walk towards him and I asked him who he wanted togive this doll to.""It is the doll that my sister loved most and wanted somuch for this Christmas. She was so sure that Santa Claus would bring it toher.""I replied to him that maybe Santa Claus will bring it to her afterall, andnot to worry. But he replied to me sadly. ""No, Santa Claus cannot bring itto her where she is now. Ihave to give the doll to my mother so that she can give it to her when shegoes there.""His eyes were so sad while saying this. ""My sister has gone to be with God.Daddy says that Mummy will also go to see God very soon, so I thought thatshe could take the doll with her to give it to my sister"".My heart nearly stopped. The little boy looked up at me andsaid: ""I told daddy to tell mummy not to go yet. I asked him to wait untilI came back from the supermarket"". Then he showed me a very nice photoof him where he was laughing. He then told me: ""I also want mummy to takethis photo with her so that she will not forget me. I love my mummy and Iwish she doesn't have to leave me but daddy says that she has to go to bewith my little sister"". Then he looked again at the doll with sad eyes,very quietly. I quickly reached for my wallet and took a few bills and saidto the boy.  ""What if we checked again, just in case if you have enough money?"" ""Ok"" he said. ""I hope that I have enough"".I added some of my money to his without him seeing and we started to countit. There was enough for the doll, and even some left over.The little boy said: ""Thank you God for giving me enough money"".Then helooked at me andadded:""I asked yesterday before I went to sleep for God to make sure I haveenough money to buy this doll so that mummy can give it to my sister. Heheard me. I also wanted to have enough money to buy a white rose for mymummy, but didn't dare to ask God too much. But he gave me enough to buythe doll and the white rose."" ""You know, my mummy loves white roses"". A fewminutes later, the old lady came back again and I left with my cart.I finished my shopping in a totally different state from when I started. Icouldnt get the little boy out of my mind. Then I remembered a localnewspaper article 2 days ago, which mentioned of a drunk man in a truck whohit a car where there was one young lady and a little girl. The little girldied right away, and the mother was left in a critical state. The familyhad to decide whether to pull the plug on the life-assistingmachine, because the young lady would not be able to get out of the coma.Was this thefamily of the little boy?Two days after this encounter with the little boy, I read in the newspaperthat the young lady had passed away. I couldn't stop myself and went to buya bunch of white roses and I went to the mortuary where the body of theyoung woman was exposed for people to see and make last wish before burial.She was there, in her coffin, holding abeautiful white rose in her hand with the photo of the little boy and thedoll placedover her chest. I left the place crying, feeling that my life had beenchanged forever. The love that this little boy had for his mother and hissister is still, to this day, hard to imagine. And in a fraction of asecond,a drunk man had taken all this awayfrom him.  ...  FRIENDS ARE LIKE ANGELS, WHO HELP US FLY WHENOUR WINGS HAVE FORGOTTEN HOW TO FLY.  "

16367,4256858,"17,August,2004",2004-08-17,"   JUST FRIENDS ? By Susan Nikaido  If my sources are correct, the following scenario isplayed out frequently among the world of Christiansingles. It happens on both sides of the gender line,but allow me to talk about it from my own femaleperspective.A man meets a woman and begins to show interest inher. He asks her to spend time with him on a regularbasis : hiking, biking, watching videos. He calls herat least once a week just to talk. He begins tellingher about the deeper things in his heart and invitesher to share at this level as well.He sends her mushy ""friendship"" cards and tells herthat she means a great deal to him. He may become alittle affectionate : the hugs begin to linger.The relationship has been defined as friendship, if ithas been defined at all. But after all this specialattention, the woman is definitely feeling more. Soshe asks the guy what's going on.To her surprise, he does a quick about-face. Heinsists they are just friends. After that, he avoidsher, leaving her hurt and bewildered. She feelsrejected - she has lost not only a romantic interest(she thought) but worse, a close and trusted friend.And she feels stupid. Did she really misread all thosesignals?After I experienced this as a single woman, I asked afriend my friend ""Joe"" to help me understand why guysdo this. After I told him my woeful tale, he said, ""Idid that to somebody once.""""What? Why would you ever do such a thing?"" I asked.""We were getting too close, and it scared me,"" hesaid.This helped me understand why the ""just friends""syndrome is so widespread. A guy wants to get to knowa girl, but without the pressure of dating. So hespends a lot of time with her, treating her in manyways like a girlfriend but defining the relationshipas friends. This way, if it begins to look likethere's no future in the relationship, or he's notready to ""get serious,"" he can back away with no messybreakup. It sounds like a nice arrangement - for theguy.But that approach can be a problem for the woman. If aman tells a woman he just wants to ""be friends"" but hetreats her like it's more than friendship, she willbelieve his behavior instead of his words. It sets herup for a big disappointment. Or if he invokes the""just friends"" mantra after being asked about thenature of the relationship, but then promptly beginsto distance himself from the friendship, again, hisactions do not match his words.He may think he's sparing her feelings by avoiding abreakup. But by defining the relationship as afriendship, he hurts her even more deeply when hedisappears. A dating relationship comes with certainrisks. But she expects a friendship - especially sucha close one - to continue. Think about it this way : Abroken dating relationship says only, ""I don't want tomarry you""; a broken friendship says to her, ""I don'twant/value you on any level.""Taking a woman down this path violates two scripturalprinciples. First, it's dishonest. The apostle Paulsaid that it was the way of the world - not of a godlyman - to say ""yes, yes"" and ""no, no"" in the samebreath (2 Cor. 1:17).A man of integrity will call a relationship what itis. Second, it is not kind or loving. The ""justfriends"" approach may be safer for the guy, but it isharmful to the woman. In effect, he is asking her forthe rewards of a dating relationship - companionship,emotional intimacy, even affection - without theresponsibility. He is playing with her heart, and herheart will probably get broken.But what if a guy does only want to be friends - orwants to develop a friendship before he decides todate?It's pretty simple. He just treats the woman like allhis other friends. He doesn't spend more time with heror call her more often than he does his other friends.He usually invites other people along when he getstogether with her. He doesn't pick up the tab whenjust the two of them go out. He avoids complimentsthat might communicate she is ""special"" to him. Helets her know he spends time with other women. He'sextremely careful about showing any physical affection* even playful shoves or hugs.If, after getting to know her from a safe emotionaldistance, he wants a deeper relationship, he tells herthat he wants to date her.What if you are not thinking about more thanfriendship, but she asks about your intentions? Tellher you appreciate her friendship, but be honest aboutwhere you are. Above all, though it may be awkward fora while, continue to be her friend.Years ago, I began to be attracted to a male friend.Though I hadn't really been getting any signals thathe was interested in me, I knew it would help settlemy emotions to hear it from him. I asked. He affirmedme as a person but told me gently - but clearly - thathe thought of me only as a friend. And then he did awonderful thing. He kept being my friend. Though ithurt a little to learn I wasn't attractive to him inthat way, it helped to know he still valued me andwanted me around. This was nearly 15 years ago, andthough we have both moved to different states andmarried, we are friends to this day.Women can be great friends. But guys, unless you areready for a dating relationship, please be careful totreat us ""as sisters, with absolute purity"" (1 Tim.5:2), not as girlfriends, nor as something in between.Your honesty - with yourself and with us- will bepleasing to the LORD, and prevent hurtful confusionfor your sisters in Christ.In the ocean of life. God is our buoyant force.No matter how strong the wind and how giagantic the waves are, we shall not sink as long as we are anchored on HIM.  "

Sa unang beses niyo mag-date tapos naramdaman niyo ang sinasabi nilang ""spark"" nako, magkaharap pa kayo naiisip mo na ang bukas Para matawagan mo na siya at maayang makipag-date ulit, pero sa susunod kayong dalawa na lang.  Hindi ka mapakali pag wala siya sa tabi mo o hindi mo siya nakakausap sa isang araw, sigurado at sigurado tatawagan mo siya sa opisina, sa bahay at pag wala doon maglo-load ka sa cellphone mo at uubusuin ang 300 na prepaid sa loob ng isang tawag na wala naman ibang laman kundi bungisngis, kamustahan at kuento tungkol sa lahat ng sama ng loob mo sa mga ex mo.  At ang goodbye sa telepono ay nde matapos-tapos, hindi niyo malaman kung sino ang unang magbababa at umaasa kang me ""Take care"" sa huli. Me email pa yan sa umaga para masabi mo sa kanya na masaya ka na nakapag-usap kayo. Minsang gumimik kayo at upbeat ang sounds, hala! sayaw ka kahit parehong Kaliwa nag mga paa mo, pero gusto niyang sumayaw kaya sige sasayaw ka na rin. Kahit ilang mule, arctic at sub-zero ang orderin niya wala kang pakialam, mas mabuti nga kse nga puede mo na siyang akbayan at I-hug pag medio lasing na siya, pag hindi siya pumalag nako! score! para kang nasa langit.  Malamang, matapos mo siyang ma-hug eh ayaw mo nang maligo at lagi mong naaalala ang scent ng pabango niya na me halong amoy alcohol na pero para sa yo mabango pa din siya.  At siempre tuwing matapos kayong gumimik eh ayaw mo pa rin matapos ang gabi kaya hihirit ka pa ng coffee, kahit isandaan ang isang baso, ""So what?!?"" kamo, pera lang yan ang importante kasama mo siya.  Masaya ka rin pag na-traffic kayo kse makakapagkuentuhan pa kayo pauwi. Matiyaga mong inaral ang pagda-drive ng manual gamit lang ang isang kamay kse yun isa hawak yun kamay niya o nakadantay sa hita niya habang nag mamaneho ka. Araw-araw magmamakaawa ka na ihatid mo siya at kung puede ka rin niyang Ihatid pauwi, at kung lulusot baka pati lunch eh puede na rin na kayo ang maging lunchmates.  Pag me free time ka eh nasa bookstore ka para nagtingin ng mga puedeng ibigay na greeting cards. Nakalimutan mo na ang barkada mo, para sa yo malaking abala lang sila sa napakagandang lovelife mo kesehodang magtampo pa sila sa yo at magsolian na kayo ng kandila sa inaanak mo sa kanila. At kung aalis man kayo nde ka magkasya sa pagte-text lang sa lab mo, kelangan mong pumunta sa banyo para lang magkarinigan kayo pag tinawagan mo siya at sabihin na nde ka nag-eenjoy at mas gusto mo na siya ang kasama. Pagdating ng weekend nako para kang intsik! alas dies pa lang ng umaga nasa kanila ka na at me dalang suhol na breakfast para sa nanay niyang nakasimangot dahil natutulog pa ang anak niya eh andun ka na.  Pagdating ng gabi kahit antok na antok na siya eh ayaw mo pa ring umuwi, hinihintay mong makatulog siya sa mga bisig mo para makanakaw ka ulit ng kiss.  Iniisip mo rin kung kelan ka kaya niya ipapakilala sa friends niya? Nung kayo na, lahat ng monthsary ice-celebrate niyo, me kasama pang surprise na regalo at date. At nde miminsan mong nabanggit na gusto mo na siyang Pakasalan at wala nang ibang babae sa puso at wala ka nang makikita na katulad niya. AFTER ONE YEAR Mahal ang gimik sa bar, mas maganda kung kakain na lang kayo sa Jollibee at manonood ng sine. Wag na kayo magkape, masyadong mahal with matching comment na ""Leche, me ginto ba yan?"" Mas gusto mo nang kasama barkada mo dahil ""minsan"" lang kayo magkita sa isang linggo. Pgakahatid mo sa kanya, nagmamadali kang umuwi sa gabi dahil pagod ka na sa trabaho. Pumapasok at umuuwi na siya mag-isa dahil nde mo siya masusundo dahil puyat ka. Syet! wag ka niyang pipiliting sumayaw at nakakahiya. Anong tawag? Sa load mong 300, mauubos yun at 1 beses mo lang tinext (against 245 na text niya sa yo) at 3 minutes mo siyang natawagan.  Naubos ang load mo kakatawag sa mga barkada mo at kaka forward ng joke sa kanila. Pag weekend mas gusto mong manood na lang  ng TV o matulog. Pupunta ka lang Pag tumawag na siya at nagmamakaawang dalawin mo  naman siya at me suhol na ipinagluto ka niya. Kahit automatic na kotse mo nde mo pa rin makuhang hawakan ang kamay niya habang namamaneho ka. Magastos ang mga monthsary, kung anniversary niyo nga eh wala kang regalo, monthsary pa?!? Mag-uusap kayo? Baket me problema ba? Kung wala, isang oras kang manonood ng TV habang siya eh nakatutulog na kahihintay na kausapin mo siya. Miss na niyang ini-email mo siya,sagot mo? ""Jusko naman araw-araw na Tayong nag-uusap ano pa ba naman ang sasabihin ko sa yo? Baka gusto mo pa ng card?!?"" Pag aayain ka niya para gumimik with her friends ang sagot mo? ""Utang na loob, kung gusto mong lumabas kasama friends mo ikaw na lang mag-isa at naiilang ako."" Pero pag lalabas kayo with your friends umiinit ulo mo pag tahimik siya pag nagjo-joke sila tungkol sa inyo ng ex mo sabay tanong ""Nde ka ba nag-eenjoy? Buiset, umuwi na nga lang tayo!"" At tungkol naman sa kasal...""Jusko naman, nde mo ba ako maintindihan?!? Wala pa akong pera saka nde ko maiisip yan ngayon! Sana wag ka namang makulit."" Sa lahat ng ito, ngingiti na lang siya, iisipin lahat ng ginagawa mo noong nanliligaw ka pa  malamang umaasa pa yun na babalik yun dati sabay buntung-hininga at sabi ng malakas...""Kay sarap ng in-love.""

I even got to see my previous Prefect Master whom I had adore and idolised since Secondary 1 when I first got into Prefectorial Board. However, he left to become a counsellor after teaching my batch for 1 year... which had made us felt quite sad.... Even though times spent toking and communicating wif him had become veri veri less... but then our relationship is still as close as though he is still our Prefect Master...

Even though there may haf been conflict within all of us... I do not think that I will wanna solve it as the other party had not seem to put in the effort, and that others had hated her/him.... She/He may be in the good books of the teachers... but then she/he will noe that all the tough work had been done by her/his colleagues whereas she/he had been the one whu had been gaining the credit...

24345,4256976,"19,August,2004",2004-08-19,"   Women can be so cruel.  She was already at the bar when Alain opened the heavy door to the dingy saloon that over the last few months had become his regular choice for post workday drinking and relaxation.  Alain never thought that he would ever be able to muster the self-esteem he thought was required to walk into a bar alone, order a drink and enjoy it quietly.  He had sworn to himself, since his University days, that drinking was a social event.  Therefore, a solo excursion to a bar would forever be helpless, lonely, and desperate.  But he had never been very good at holding a grudge against himself and immediately attempted to contrive a sort of academic experience out of his current situation.  This decision not to turn and flee lasted longer than he had expected.  So, standing awkwardly in the doorway but with new resolve, he searched for the appropriate place to sit.  Alain searched the few scattered faces around him.  They all seemed vaguely familiar like extras in the predictable bar scene of some marginally interesting movie.  For several years Alain had felt himself to be a marginally interesting character whose story, with an expert pitch, could find its way onto the big screen.  But it would only be great once some big time actor pulled out the performance of a career by really capturing the dreary, selfish and pathetic excuse for optimism that propelled Alain through each day.  After this realization, Alain had decided it would be best for the project if he never thought about it again but his current surroundings brought it back out of him.  "
24346,4256976,"18,August,2004",2004-08-18,"   The knight had been following me for several days.  He was adorned in full suit of silvery armor that remained untarnished through thick brush, beaches and swamps.  â€œWhat was his purpose?â€ I wondered to myself.  As I climbed atop every new hill, I could look back and see an unrelenting glimmer from the previous one.  He would always be there.  So I decided to rest a bit and wait for him.  The wind rustled through the long grass swaying around me.  It seemed to whisper words of caution as I gazed at my determined pursuer.  As the glimmer grew closer, I questioned whether this was in fact a wise decision.  He could be hostile.  If he were carrying news he would certainly not have made the journey in such attire.  I tried to take my mind off him.  This proved to be a much more difficult task than I had expected.  When I turned away I could feel hot breath exciting the hairs on my neck.  I could feel his cold blade turning my insides out as he took advantage of that one brief instant that I had let down my guard.  I saw myself stepping away from his second slash, this time to my throat.  But the damage had already been done.  I cradled my organs, steaming in the autumn air, as they crept from the gaping wound he had delivered me.  I fell to my knees.  Each dancing blade of grass lashed at me with cruel joy, scratching and scraping my blood-soaked arms.  My eyes filled with tears.  I lifted my head to glimpse the two blurred suns hovering in the sky before me.  I could feel the heat of both of them.  With great pain I removed my right arm from the nest it had created around my pulsing wound and reached for the hotter and brighter celestial body.  I wrapped my hand around the knightâ€™s gauntlet, glowing white.  All feeling and pain was redirected as the hot metal burned into my fingers, soldering my quivering flesh to his hard, forged glove.  My palm gushed forth steam as it melted to the knight.  I tried to tear my arm away but the pain was even greater than submittal.  So I did my best to relax in this terrible state, for my end must certainly be drawing near.  I must have passed out for only a minute, but it could have been a day for that matter.  What must have awoken me was the intense heat building against my right cheek which was merely inches away from my attackers breastplate.  I attempted to wriggle my right arm but to my horror it had vanished into the fiend up to the elbow.  The knight was fusing me into his burning shell.  I pulled furiously to detach my forearm which was now most certainly his.  I cried out as my face pressed against his armor.  The burning reignited in my brain as it began to boil and my howling was muffled, as I no longer had my mouth.  "
24347,4256976,"17,August,2004",2004-08-17,"   This wedding was different than all the others.  It was different in the way that everyone who attended the festive event died.  Well, not everybody died.  Just everyone who ate or drank at the splendid event died but even that was a pretty large number.  The Brideâ€™s family was dead and so was the Groomâ€™s.  It would later come out that unanticipated levels of poison where incorporated into the food and drink prepared for the glorious occasion.  It would later be revealed that a wedding gift had been stolen from the Newlywedâ€™s.  However the ownership of the gift was called into question due to the unavailability of any beneficiaries.  Therefore the gift had been stolen from the State.  Investigators assigned to the case were tripled now that it was a State affair.  It would later be discovered that no one had actually died at the once happy, once tragic ceremony.  The theft was reclassified as a merely a family concern but the wheels had been set in motion.  The transfer of ownership of the family property to the State, including stolen and non-stolen wedding gifts, had already been completed due to some excellent paper pushing by government officials.  A top official made a formal apology to all in attendance who, at this time, were no longer dead but still asleep.  What began as a simple misunderstanding between the State and two families would soon boil into a stew of bad feelings when the father of the bride appeared to refuse the offer of forgiveness by declining the government officialâ€™s handshake.  Only reports of the non-death aspect of the case had been analyzed before the ill-fated apology took place.  Immediately, the clerk responsible for handling the paperwork was promoted and shipped across the ocean.  The day was declared a State holiday and all government employees were sent home with the day off with the exception of investigators assigned to the stolen property case, who were immediately paid overtime.  This however did not help uncover any clues regarding the size, shape, weight, or whereabouts of the stolen gift.  The previous owner of the gift was questioned but could provide no real insight due to the fact that he was asleep.  He was later thrown in prison for not cooperating with the State authorities.  "
24348,4256976,"17,August,2004",2004-08-17,"   The Inevitable End is the name given to the series of events which will bring about the demise of Winky and Sam but the subsequent saving the World.  A note on the World:  It exists in all time so nothing is anachronistic.  The events, vaguely prophesized by the Magnificent Cube are as follows:  Winky will fall in battle and Sam will slay The Chosen One.  This foretelling is unknown to our protagonists at this point.  A note on the foretelling: This one point may seem to fly in the face of the earlier note stating that the World exists in all time.  It doesnâ€™t.  Only events foretold by the Cube are unknown to the rest of the World until they eventually happen.  The magnitude of the Cubeâ€™s prophecies is such that each event marks a critical point in the history of the World.  The history of the World was known and catalogued at the beginning of the World by The Keeper of the Magnificent Cube.  Cube Events are so huge that all inhabitants are pretty much aware that a critical point in their history has been reached.  However, the Keeper would remark to the uninformed, â€œYeah, that was a Cube Event.â€  The Inevitable End, a mildly superfluous title after that explanation, is the final event foretold by the Cube.  The World, however, still goes on afterwards.  Sam, alone, walks the earth until his eventual unrecorded death and unattended funeral.  The Cube withers and dissolves.  The Keeper sends a copy of The History to each of the Twelve Libraries.  The World is well, good, and uneventful.  This is where we are going according to The Magnificent Cube.  A note on the Magnificent Cube: it is actually a sphere.  "
24349,4256976,"17,August,2004",2004-08-17,"   There are many characters that need to be explored.  It wouldnâ€™t be much help to list them all at the onset.  Probably the best way to learn the histories and futures of the doomed cast is to appreciate them individually at glances over an extended period of time.  But a few introductions are necessary.  What should be said upfront is that our protagonists, Winky and Sam, are compatriots and friends.  They share a destination.  They tread separate paths.  They drink, never beyond the point of hopeless desperation but occasionally enough for them to feed the animals before sleep.  To Sam, any story worth telling is worth exaggerating.  Winky prefers stripping a tale down to its most basic elements.  Sam searches for reactions.  Winky searches for truth.  Sam is drawn to the earth while Winky looks up to the sky.  But high or low, dirty or clean, happy or sad, their journeys to the same inevitable end are long and hard.  "
24350,4256976,"17,August,2004",2004-08-17,"   The fearless two are back from slumber in the murky depths with revelations and insight.  As before, the goal is neither to inspire society nor provide answers to even the most irrelevant questions.  If anything, the two would appreciate puzzling enjoyment, cautious curiosity, and a brief but kind word for all their efforts.  The scope of material may seem vast and foreboding but there will be help along the way.  The insight will occasionally be harsh but always forgiving.  So just like biting into a piece of over ripened fruit or hearing very bad experimental jazz for the first time, you probably wonâ€™t realize whatâ€™s wrong until itâ€™s too late.  "

Seriously, I'm sending you on a scavenger hunt.  In order to complete some activities I have planned for a    P O  E  T  R  Y   E  X  T R A  V A G  A  N  Z       A    next week, I need you to have some materials ready.  Your assignment is this:  Each student in the class needs to find each of the following items.  The goal is to find the objects which will be used in class (so you shouldnâ€™t need to have them in the same form to take back home), and not spend any money on them.  Look around the garbage can for the junk mail or a ""stash-it-all"" drawer for the postcards or letters, for example.  Items due in class on Monday and I will give you credit for all of your hard work.  Good luck and happy hunting!    Item list   One permanent ink marker (preferably some dark color) One t-shirt (white or light color) that fits you An old post-card (blank) An old post-card with message A very, very, very sharpened pencil At least four used postage stamps (at least 1â€ x 1â€--the larger the better)â€”on the envelopes or off Ten pieces of junk mail An old magazine (school appropriate :) Some sort of blank book A piece of wood (no larger than 1â€™ x 1â€™ x 1â€) An old calendar page (any month--bring extras if you find them) An old letter A map (can be local, national, world, etc.) A family recipe A shoebox to hold all of it (unless your piece of wood is too big--try to make it fit!)    Point #2 You should begin e-mailing me your drafts that you are beginning to finish.  Mail to:   urlLink lhager@mercer.k12.ky.us  "

Each week, I'll give you a prompt (for example, the one from yesterday) and for the other prompt, you will be invited to either post your own writing for people to read/respond to AND/or respond to a second prompt. We'll see how this works. Even though things can be read by anyone searching through the blog, I believe that keeping the response contained will make things run much more smoothly.  Thanks. Ms. H  "

Meanwhile, could those of you who DIDN'T follow the link go back and try to follow it.  It might be that the system simply has to make the connection.  Try this and see what it does.  Thanks!  "

13529,4257430,"16,August,2004",2004-08-16,"   Hi all, See, this blogging thing isn't too hard after all! Even I can do it. I hope you've made your way around online and found this journal. My intention is for us to be able to keep it as a class journal much in the way we would do if we were keeping a written, bound journal. The way I understand it (yes, I'm still trying things out here), is that after I put your email in you have to ""join."" You should have received an email ""invitation."" Then, you are able to post to this blog.  I'd like to start out by setting up a first prompt for you to respond to: how do you perceive class going so far? I'm interested, particularly, in knowing how you are responding to some of the ""freedoms"" that writing workshop allows like being able to define your own writing tasks--things that you want/need to write about, etc. How do you feel about being given writing time in class rather than it all being given as homework? What would you like to see as a feature of your class??  The other thing I'd like some feedback on (and I'm going to be asking you in class about this, too) is what you might want our webzine (and print magazine) to look like. What should its title be? We have to start thinking about how we will invite other writers to join our little party, so it's going to be important to make some of these decisions soon.  I can't tell you how long I've waited to teach a creative writing class. I am really enjoying what you've done so far. You just have to promise to push me as hard as I push you (well, maybe not that hard :)  Post your thoughts! I think I'll stumble over to the blog for portfolio_princess and journal my thoughts for the day. . . Let me know if you set up an online blog for yourself (or if you already have one you want to keep working in). I'll have to make note of the URL. Ms. H  "

13531,4257430,"22,August,2004",2004-08-22,"   For this week, I'd like you to consider this question. What is the best piece of writing you have ever done? Describe it. In what particular genre did you write? Why do you consider it your best?  "
4554,4259479,"20,August,2004",2004-08-20,"   ...on my French reading, REALLY WEIRD BOOK, RhinocÃ©ros, although i'm only like 50, 60 pages into it, i wouldn't suggest it to maintain mental health... but anyway... i woke up at 7 to go swimming.... that didn't happen, then woke up at 9h50 and i had to be at my Japanese teacher's house in Pleasant Hill at 10h00... zoomed over there feeling all gross and she stuffed me with food like i was a turkey for thanks giving or something, she doens't understand when i tell her i don't want any... and that last for like three hours.. finished up my third-year Kanji (the characters) and then came home around one or after... need to go to registration, but would rather go on monday... my mom is busy with the counselor anyway... i need to do like five loads of laundry, read at least 40 pages of french ...and study a bit of my spanish before school starts, and then i took a shower, need to eat breakfast... and mucho ist aller on (that was awesome: sp, ger, fr)   and .. later i'm goin to Robert's to watch the one and only Princess Mononoke! then chill or whatever... anyway, i'm psyched... but i still need to manage my time better... and i wont have too much to do anything before school starts cuz i work on Sat and Sun from 9-5... so not a whole lot of time to do my homework... although i will be getting much money for the amount of time i'm working... i love money... and this is Cullen REDDY, signing off with Channel CTR news...

4558,4259479,"17,August,2004",2004-08-17,"   I've decided to metion a couple songs or artists that i've discovered while i was in Europe every so often because STUPID america doesn't like good music.... well ... ...anyway, download them and see if you like...   Jamelia - Stuper Star  (it's in english, but i don't know if she's british or not, so didnt know if we'd have it here...) K Maro - Femme Like You  (all you frenchies out there, good song) Tiziano Ferro - Perverso  (there's an italian, a spanish, and a french version.... check out his other music too, good stuff)  "
4559,4259479,"17,August,2004",2004-08-17,"   So a couple days after i got back from Europe, i noticed that my hermit crabs weren't moving too much altho they didn't do too much of that in the first place... and then noticed one of the limbs fell off one of them, and i found out my first crab was dead, and then a coupel days later, the other died.... how sad.... AND THEN a couple days later i step out of the shower and notice somethign squirming on the counter, and it's one of my crabs! A miracle!  so my favorite one was still alive.... (yes i often leave dead crabs on my bethroom counter for days on end...) and then this morning i realized he was dead again.... that's sounds weird... i hate those crabs messing with my mind...  "
4560,4259479,"17,August,2004",2004-08-17,"   So summer is ending, i've been back from Europe, I still have to read that damn AP French book and do the packets, and we only have a week till school starts... but on the bright side, we're gonna be seniors! and then there's also Robert!  My really cool boyfriend in the making....Quel type!... : ) and then what's with the whole senior picnic not being a picnic and actually us going to a baseball game!?  I hate baseball! anyone else?

25491,4261141,"22,August,2004",2004-08-22,"   Well it's me again....of course!! (Nee-cole)      Well Friday I had five friends come over and hang out for a while. Then we all went to John's for the night. My dad had given me 20$ since he sponsors our team. (it's called Shotgun Shellz) We used the money to get junk food. YUM!! We stayed up until around 11 playing Halo. Then the next morning we were up, dressed, and out of the house by 9. We had to be in Winter Park, at Thumb Fu by 11:30. (we watched SWAT on the way there) We were there by 10:30 and the place was packed!! But we didn't start until around one b/c a team was coming late. There were 17 teams, each with 4 players, we have 7 but were only allowed to bring 4. We didn't get out of there until around 7. When I got home there was no one home so I ended up going to a friends again for the night. Today we finished the movie b/c we didn't have time to watch it all on the way. It was a pretty cool movie, one of my favorite action movies. Well that's it, there you have it sounds fun, huh? O, by the way we didn't do so good because the team got to pick the level and of course they picked their best, and it was best two out of three. So we didn't make it past the first round. The first time we kicked butt though!!! We'll do better next time!!!      Well, thanks for being faithful to my site!!!! Well to Mikes site but I do all the work!!! But anywho gotta run!!      This was Nicole and Mike, Love Ya'll!!  "
25492,4261141,"22,August,2004",2004-08-22,"   Hello to all and how are you? Well of course this is Nee-cole. And I am here to tell about Mike's day.   (Well yesterday and today)      Well, Mike and Baron had plan to come see me but things didn't work out. Instead they were going to go to Pinellas but that didn't work out either. See Carolyn and Travis told Baron they were going to get Suzie. So Baron decided he wanted to stay to see her I guess so anywho they ended up not going anywhere. Just stayed home and ""hung out"". Well, they showed up at church in these outfits that sound wierd Baron was sporting a Vintage suit that was pink and green plad and Mike was sporting a Vintage suit that was corduroy. (I think I spelled that right) Some ppl thought they looked good others thought not so good. (I would have been in the 2nd group) After church they went home (Jean's) and changed, then Carolyn, Suzie, Mike and Baron decided they were going to go see ""The Little Black Book"". Well Mike was paying for Baron so when they went up to the window and asked for the tickets and the chic laughed in their faces. (I would have too) After the movie walking out to the car, a bum got 50 cents off Baron. Mike stayed at Jean's for the night then went home the next morning at around 11 and was pretty tired b/c he didn't go to bed until about 3 so he took a little nap. And that's all folks.....Hope you enjoy knowing what he does everyday!! I bet it's really interesting to ya'll. LoL Well, Nicolina I am sorry that we couldn't come see you and I would have rather gone to see you, maybe sometime soon. I miss you.            Well, as interesting as his life is, my hands are tired from typing so I think I will end here... Did you like the part where they didn't want to come see me? I did, thought it was quite amusing. O yeah I forgot to metion that just know I got to talk to Mike's mom, she seems very nice. And I got to talk to my lil' sis Alyssa, she is so sweet I wish her and Lauren could change places for a while LOL!! But anywho Aloha!!        This is Nee-cole and Mike love ya'll!!        P.S. Aloha means hello and goodbye!!  "
25493,4261141,"22,August,2004",2004-08-22,"   Well it's Nee-cole again it looks like I will be doing all the writing, but he will tell me happened in his day or week or whatever. So here I am being faithful to his site and he isn't on to tell me about his day!! But I do know this:  Today, I was suppose to go see Nee-cole but things didn't work out I am so upset. I was really looking forward to seeing her, maybe soon I can. I think I will go to my room and have a good cry, yeah that sounds good.  Mike is not going to allow me to do his posts much longer!! LOL But o well I guess he would have to do them then so haha!! But ya anywho....  This was Nee-cole posting for Mike!! Love ya'll!  "
25494,4261141,"22,August,2004",2004-08-22,"   Hello to all,  Well this is acually Nee-cole writing, b/c Mike (Josephine) is too lazy to write,....so I am going to tell you about his day.  Well, the day started off great Baron woke me (Well him) up, We went to Bill's right after that, to cut up a tree. Fun Fun Fun. After that we went to Jonathan and Holly's to get rid of the deck that was moved by wonderful Charley. Baron threw me into the pool, later I tried to kick a piece of wood and I fell in again. So I got to go swimming twice today, fully clothed!! Speaking of this hurricane we are out of school for a week since, there is no electricity. Okay now back to my day....After that we came home (to Jean's) I took a shower and then Jean took me to my house and since then have been waiting on the computer hoping to get a chance to talk to Nicole. She is just a sweet person to talk to. O but i didn't get to tell you the best part Baron may allow me to ride with him, to Nicole's. I hope i get to go b/c i would love to get to see her.  Well, I hope everybody is doing okay, and Micheal is going to kick my butt!! LOL Bye, thanks for reading   Nicole, writing for Mike  "
627,4263309,"22,August,2004",2004-08-22,"   Well it is sunday morning and I'm out of cream for my coffee.  Sunday mornings are not suppose to be like that. In fact I should have been served coffee and breaky in bed by some tall good looking stud! That way the stud would have to get dressed to go for cream and not me.  At least that's the way I see it in my world. The weeks events took me to work and a funeral. A close friend of mine lost her great grandmother and the service was held on Friday.  I grew up with Shannon and have always been concidered one of the family. Shannon has a large family who are all very close and know how to celebrate life. It was wonderful to see them all and great to take a little trip down memory lane. So that is four weddings and a funeral this summer, I bet that would make a great movie! It's cold in my apartment this morning and I'm just the picture of loveliness with my flannel nighty, housecoat and sweater on. Shouldn't it be summer for pete's sake?! After I run for coffee cream I will sit and try to fiqure out how to put pictures up on this thing so stay tuned...  "
628,4263309,"18,August,2004",2004-08-18,"   Well let's see, what did I do today?  I did laundry.  Yup a productive day off. Tonight I'm going out to dinner with my son and daughter in-law in celebration of their birthdays. Paul turned 27 (that's what happens when you have children at the age of 12 and your so young and your son is so old) on the 8th of this month and Dana turns 25 on the 25th. We are going to a quaint little resturant called ""Le Speggett"". There are only about 8 tables in the place and you have to make a reservation weeks in advance. The food is to die for! Ok I better run downstairs and get my clothes out of the dryer before someone empties it and sees my large cotton panties. The last time that happened I caught the girl with them in her hand, it wasn't pretty and when I was done she was brighter pink then the colour of my briefs! As if it isn't bad enough to have to put your clean clothes into a dryer which has been filled with god knows what, you run the risk of someones paws on your nickers!  Have a great day all  "
629,4263309,"17,August,2004",2004-08-17,   Well today is the begining of my postings.

11686,4271205,"23,August,2004",2004-08-23,"   I lost my Passport and am suppose to be going on vacation in two weeks!  Now I have to have an emergency service expedite my application so that I won't miss my vacation.  I've lost my passport before, but it was taken care of for me b/c it was the fault of the airlines for losing our luggage.  Luckily we were back in the states.  And yes, I am absent minded  enough not to remember to put my Passport in my carry-on luggage or purse.  Terrible, I know.  Anyway,  here I am trying to fill out the online customer verification forms and my computer freezes.  Okay, no problem.  I'll just open another window and redo it.  Now their site is down!  I've got a headache now.  So I call the service and he says that the site is down, but I should try again in 15 minutes.  Okay, fine.   It's official.  I won't be able to get this stuff done until tommorrow, but the guy says I should still get my Passport by Sept. 1st. STRESS!  "
11687,4271205,"20,August,2004",2004-08-20,"   I auditioned for ""The Crucible"" on Monday for the part of Tituba. She is the slave in the story of The Salem Witch trials that plagued Salem, Massachusetts in the 1600's. It is a really powerful story and I thought that it would be a good piece to do to show my emotional range. Though I knew that if I was cast in You're a Good Man Charlie Brown it would be kind of hard to do both because the rehearsals would overlap. But it would have been possible.  That is, until I got an e-mail from the co-founder of the theatre company saying ""We've decided to go with another actress for Tituba. We feel she needs to be more of a middle aged woman, and you're just too young and pretty to fit that image. :- )""  Now I, like anyone else, love a good compliment. But, in this case, I think she was just trying to cushion the fact that I didn't get the part. (now would be a good time to refer to the title of my blog)   I appreciate her complimenting me to cushion the blow, but it wasn't necessary and certainly wasn't sincere. Age I can see being a problem, but make-up can make a person look the part. Just  urlLink look  at what they did to  urlLink Vanessa Williams in ""Into The Woods"" . They made her a witch. Yuk!  I am also tired of every playwright thinking that middle-aged black women are the only black actresses in the theatre. Musicals aren't so bad...at least not the modern ones. But straight plays seem to only portray the middle-aged or grandma-aged black woman b/c she is usually there to signify wisdom or culture. For example: The character of Tituba is a slave from Barbados, she represents both. So unless the director embraces non-traditional or color blind casting, it's almost a lost cause.  By the way, has anyone seen ""The Crucible""? I rented the video and watched it before I went to the audition. I thought the movie was quite good. It's stars Winona Ryder as Abigail. This time she's trying to steal someone's husband instead of clothes, but it's still and interesting movie.  "
11688,4271205,"19,August,2004",2004-08-19,"   My company is going through a restructuring because, all of a sudden, the stockholders want to know everything that's going on and what everyone's specific job description is. Apparently the dividend checks were quite healthy last go-round and they see this company as a huge asset.  It's all fine with me, but I live in the quiet part of the building and when the contractor comes in to meet with the department heads it is quite disturbing. First of all his voice is hella loud. Even with the door closed you can hear his conversation TOO loud and clear. And since he meets with everyone individually he is here all day. I was trying to write a press release earlier and mistakenly typed what he was saying b/c he was so loud! I keep meaning to bring my headphones but I am too much of a scatterbrain to remember. Luckily this only happens every other week and when he's done he'll be gone forever, or at least until the next time the stockholders want to spy.  I guess I'm a little spoiled b/c there are only two people in Advertising and we have this side of the building all to ourselves. They call us the Advertising snobs, b/c we rarely socialize with rest of the people here. But we really have no reason to. And if we do, there's always e-mail or ICQ. Hey, that's rhymes!  This makes me think of Office Space, b/c  urlLink Shawn  loves that movie. He said he gave it to his co-worker and she had to watch it two times to get it. I thought it was a funny movie. I think he likes it so much b/c he once was, or maybe still is, the guy who makes the TPS reports. He told me that his department has to watch a movie together today for some kind of B of A (Bank of America) bonding and he was going to try and slip in Office Space. The bank can be a weird place.  "
11689,4271205,"19,August,2004",2004-08-19,"   I got a call from the director of You're A Good Man, Charlie Brown last night and he offered me the role of Lucy. I wanted the role of Sally, but after thinking about it....a black girl in a blonde wig would just be wrong! Even if it is the theatre. The only reason I wanted to be Sally was so I could sing ""My New Philosophy"" anyway. But it's a really fun song. Lucy, however, is the lead female role. So I'm excited. There are only two females in the cast and four males; Charlie Brown, Schreoder, Linus, and Snoopy.  I just finished doing Cinderella at Old Courthouse Theatre in Concord. I was Joy, one of the evil stepsisters. I had fun but was kind of overshadowed b/c we had a guy in drag playing Portia, the other stepsister. He was really funny but keeping up w/ him was a workout....and I've got scars on my knees to prove it! You know Drag Queens, they are major upstagers!! Major! But the crowd loved it so I guess we did our job.  By the way ""You're A Good Man, Charlie Brown"" is a musical about the Peanuts characters. The director also told me who else was going to be in the cast. We have a very talented group, so I know that it's going to be a great show! Rehearsal starts Monday!  "
11690,4271205,"18,August,2004",2004-08-18,"   Well I finally decided to start a blog since I never have time to update my  urlLink website . Not to mention the fact that am extremely bored today. I have a lot of work on my desk, but doing it is boring me to death b/c it's monotonous search engine work.  Earlier today I decided to call my sister who just moved into a new apartment and out of my mother's house. She wasn't there but my other sister was. We talked for about 30 minutes and just as my spirits were starting to rise she tells me that she's pregnant. What! I was in disbelief!   Background info: My other sister (who's house I called) is pregnant as well. And they both aren't married and already have a child.   Now I'm thinking to myself, ""Don't they have condoms in Charleston or are you allergic to them?""  Then she tells me that she's 19 weeks. That's almost 5 months!! Why doesn't anybody ever tell me anything? If I hadn't called I would have been none the wiser. She then informs me that her and her boyfriend are getting married before the child comes. I don't quite know what I think about that yet. I like her boyfriend and all, but I'm not sure that they should be getting married just b/c they have a child on the way. Then again, what's the alternative.  My mother seems to be okay with the idea of her getting married, though I'm sure she's not really thrilled about the pregnancy. They are already living together so I guess the whole situation could be a lot worse. Oh, well. I guess I'm now preparing to be an Auntie for the 5th and 6th time.  "
5486,4280767,"21,August,2004",2004-08-21,"   got my license this morning!! I'm happy, I feel so independent-ish even though I think I'm gonna make my mom ride with me in van a bit more before I actually try to take it out by myself. But still. And my license picture isn't too bad, I look like an elf! lol...  gotta go DRIVE MYSELF (!!!) to Hobby Lobby!  "
5487,4280767,"20,August,2004",2004-08-20,"   I feel much better now...not so guilty. In another sense, I feel icky, really dizzy and my stomach's still kinda upset. but oh well. I can't believe I'm updating this again...it's the second day in a row!! of course, it is new....and I don't have to worry about anyone reading it....'spretty cool.  I can't wait for school to start, thank goodness for wednesday. Maybe I'm weird....I just want to be able to have some social contact (although, this is Recluse Lydia I'm talking about...) and stop hanging around being bored all day every day. Plus I'll get to drive, woohoo.  Speaking of driving, I should get my license tomorrow. I mean, I AM going to get my license tomorrow. I guess I should look over my rule-booky-thingy but I'm really not too nervous, I know the test and I know I'm a good driver, and I don't have to drive the manual for the test. So even though I haven't driven for a week or so, I still think I'll pass. I'd better pass, because I refuse to take the MTD and have to walk all the way to that bus stop, it's insane. sigh.  I hope my mum gets my clothing allowance taken care of tomorrow so I can get some jeans...I don't really have a pair I'm willing to wear to school. and I did my job, I figured it all out and typed it up and printed it and submitted it for her approval...so technically she should really take care of it. I wouldn't mind having some of the rest of thatstuff before school starts, either.  I wonder if she's just gonna let me use my credit card for my allowance this time. Even though it's not a cash card, but she keeps saying she trusts me, so...it's cool though, I feel so powerful with that thing. I think maybe I need to ask her to make ""emergency"" more specific, lol...  once again, I have no idea how this post ended up so long. wow.  "
5488,4280767,"19,August,2004",2004-08-19,"   so it took me forever to find a web address that was ""available"". grr, who is the world (besides me, of course) would want fasterthanaspeedingwart or gagmewithaspork or lollyronismyhero or mucwerqubinwips or any of those other crazy things I came up with!! It was so frustrating!! everyone else knows my inside jokes with myself! *sob* I feel so...so violated!!!  on a different subject, I'm feeling really horrible. Which I guess is a good thing since I'm going to to end up lying and saying I threw up and passed out and went to the emergency room, etc etc as an excuse as to why I didn't show up at the movie I was supposed to go to with Merry and Aaron today. The truth is...Merry couldn't go and I refused to go without her, aka by myself. To those people who told me to just go alone, shut up. I need a buffer, ok, I couldn't go by myself, I was already feeling sick just about the idea of going WITH MERRY. And now I feel really guilty but I can't feel TOO guilty because I understand why I did it. I know people are gonna be really fed up with me....oh well. I'm afraid to answer the phone now, I'm avoiding windows, jumping at any sound....I hate this.  I doubt I'll be updating this real often, because I have a livejournal that I really like, and then I also have a xanga, which I don't like so much...and now this, too. oh well, I like blogger, maybe I'll get around to it.  hmm, now that I've seen so many commercials with Michael Phelps in them during the Olympics, I'm starting to agree with Grace. He IS hot. If only I didn't always have to see him in speedos. *shudder* Women's trampoline is on tomorrow, I'm so excited!! Trampoline rocks.  wow, it's amazing how much I'm rambling. Possibly it's because I'm home alone and hiding, which includes sitting her in the basement with the curtains closed, not on AIM, not on MSN, avoiding windows, not answering the phone. hey!! I've just realized, it's the return of Recluse Lydia!! Recluse Lydia is a paranoid delusional freak, who has no social life and at any sign of getting one reverts back to standing people up and hiding in her basement. Recluse Lydia is a jerk and Recluse Lydia is feeling guilty and very ashamed of Recluse Lydia at the moment. Recluse Lydia wishes she could call Lisa but seeing as it's a thursday afternoon and Lisa DOES have a social life/boyfriend and Recluse Lydia does not especially want to pay the phone bill resulting from the talk she needs to have with Lisa, it is not exactly likely that Recluse Lydia will get to talk to Lisa any sooner than saturday, whcih is two days away, which mean Recluse Lydia has about 2 days of feeling horrible and not being able to vent on anyone, and will be forced to rant on her online journals, subjecting any of you poor people who are unfortunately reading this to huge paragraphs told by Recluse Lydia in the third person, further proof of her insanity and need to be put into one of those way cool padded rooms. *gasp*  wow, I'm rambling way too much....think I'm going to....leave now....not that I know what else I could do...but yeah. If you read all of this, maybe you should go see a psychiatrist...haha.  "
25162,4284264,"23,August,2004",2004-08-23,"   No preachy thoughts today. I'm tired, but I have had my favorite joke on my brain all day so I thought I'd share it. This joke does not fall into the category of crude, at least I hope it doesn't. It's a joke dependent upon your ability to read with an Irish accent... basically trill your ""r's"" and vary your inflection and you're on your way. Here goes.  An older Irish gentleman stepped off of the ship and placed his foot on American soil for the first time. It was early summer many years ago, and as the ship sailed into the harbor our hero promised himself that he would, on his first day in his new home, do something uniquely American. As he walked the streets of New York, he came upon an amazing structure... it read ""Yankee Stadium"". A smile crossed his lips, and he had found the days activity. He bought his ticket and followed the crowd in to their seats.  As he sat in the crowd, it dawned on him that he had no clue how this game was played... he had never even seen it, only heard about it. The solution came to him quickly - watch the folks around you and do as they do. After all, ""When in Rome"". The first batter stepped to the plate, the pitcher wound up and released the ball... ""CRACK""! The crowd leapt to their feet cheering the runner toward first. Our hero followed suit - ""Run, run ye varmint! Run will ye?!?!?"" A few of his neighbors snickered at his exuberance, but all in all his first game was going well. The next batter stepped up, and after 3 or 4 pitches the sound of the ball and bat colliding once again drove the crowd to their feet. ""Run!!! Run ye varmint! Run will ye?!"" The Irishman was having the time of his life... his fellow onlookers had caught some of his enthusiasm and seemed to enjoy the game all the more, partly because he was there.  Then the third batter stepped to the plate. Pitch after pitch crossed before him, until finally the umpire signaled him to take his base. The crowd applauded politely as the man began a half trot, half walk towards first... all of the crowd, that is, except our hero. He was dumbfounded. He leapt to his feet - ""RUN!!! RUN YE VARMINT!!!"". Snickers from the crowd, and a look of bewilderment on the Irishman's face. He slumped into his seat, trying to sort out what had just happened when a kindly neighbor leaned over to explain the situation. ""He doesn't have to run,"" the kindly man said, ""he's got four balls."" The Irishman's gaze fell away from the fellow fan to the field, he rose to his feet and uttered these simple words: ""Walk with pride, man. Walk with pride.""  There you have it... my favorite joke ever. I cried the first time I read it... but somehow my version is always considerably longer. At least my embellishments in this version left out the smell of hotdogs and freshly cut grass. This has brought a smile to my face all day - not sure what made me think of it, but I'm thankful for it today.  Grace &amp; Peace,  PJ  "
25163,4284264,"22,August,2004",2004-08-22,"   I've spent the better part of my adult life convinced that I was supposed to be in worship ministry, or at very least in some role that made a sizeable impact on the Kingdom.  That sense of calling has been my life preserver at times, but has at times been the stone dragging me at break-neck speed towards the bottom of the lake.   Without going into great detail on this, I am in a hard season with some of God's children... I feel like I've been beaten up, left and then beaten again.  I ended up in this situation because of my compelling need to make sweeping contributions to the Kingdom - this would be a stone situation.  I felt I could bring the gifts and talents given me by God into a notoriously hard working environment and change everything and everyone there for the good of the Kingdom.  I got in there, worked as hard as I could and tried to serve to the best of my ability; I can honestly say that I gave my best out of what I thought were Holy intentions, but here I sit with my feelings hurt and my reputation on the line.  What went wrong?  Re-read that last paragraph and notice how many ""my's"" and ""I's"" are there.   I  thought that  I  could effect change...  my  calling was to take  my  gifts and talents.  I'm finding the link between when the notion of God's call and annointing over me serves as life-preserver or stone has everything to do with... well... me.  Specifically, I am finding that when I go into opportunities with my own great plans and agendas things quickly begin crumbling around me.   Here's the challenge:  I want to be a part of the body of Christ but I have always approached my life as though it were my calling to be the twinkle in the eye of Christ.  I am naturally given to arrogance, and I confess that here for all to read, but this belief was , at least in my mind, Holy.  I was supposed to be the tool with which God would bring sweeping change and revival to His people!  As it stands now, I am not God's secret weapon... what a painful discovery.  What I am learning through this time is simply this:  if all I am ever given to serve as is a callous on the foot of Christ's presence in this world then I am blessed.  I don't have to be the ring finger or the sparkle in the eye to be a part that is necessary and beautiful.  God knows me - he knows what he made me to be and that is enough.  I can't make myself more than I was created to be, but no one can take my place in the body away from me.  Grace & Peace,  PJ  "
25164,4284264,"21,August,2004",2004-08-21,"   Refresh my memory - could Jeckyl remember the atrocities of Hyde? In the spirit of confession, I never quite got around to reading this classic in school... Nor do I remember reading the Cliff's notes. I would say that I relied on the movie, but I never remember getting around to watching it either... come to think of it, how did I ever graduate? I digress. There's a theme in these horror classics in which a transformation takes place (Werewolf, Jeckyl & Hyde, the Hulk... Michael Jackson) where a ""what have I done"" moment inevitably follows ""the change"".  I can relate to the monsters in those stories a little bit... okay, a lot bit. I am one of those guys who can be just fine one minute and then something is said or takes place that absolutely sets me off. Contrast this with Jack (my son). The boy can be smiling and giggling up a storm one minute and them BAM! (all props to Emeril), the boy is screaming like mad. Fast forward ten minutes, though, and big boy is asleep or smiling again with no recognizable sign that he was ever upset. I always have the ""What did I say or do?"" moments that follow these outbursts, but Jack is ready to be loved on and played with again almost immediately. So here's the question: when does the change take place and why?  Hypothesis: Jack screams because he has a need that he can't communicate in any other way. Once the need is met, the time of need is past and it's playtime. When I go off the deep end, it's more often than not overflow - too many annoyances and challenges have built up and I'm off. If I'm not careful this blog could get crazy long, so I'll go straight to the point: We are called to be like children, and that has a great many implications, but this one is new to me. The difference between me and my boy is this: he recognizes need as need and I bury my needs under a stack of wants and ""I deserves"". Jack's day is made by being loved, being fed and being sheltered, whereas mine is ruined if I don't get all of those things  plus  affirmation from my boss, my wife's undivided attention, the blessings from God I so richly deserve... the list goes on.  What would my life look like if I was able to approach my day with the knowledge that before my feet ever touch the floor my needs have been met? What if, instead of living and dying from sale to sale (or failure to failure) I rested in the promises of God and took the time to watch the birds of the air and notice the flowers of the field? This is  not  to say that I need not work and ""provide"" for my family, rather to say that I should recognize that my NEEDS are met. You can see how this could get lengthy, so I'll leave you to stew on that instead of trying to say it in ten other ways, as is my want (certainly not your need, however).  I don't expect that I will master this any time soon, but I do believe that there is a lesson to be learned here. HIS divine power has given us everything we need for life... for I know the plans I have for you says the Lord... you have been given a spirit not of slavehood, but of children - and THAT IS WHAT WE ARE - children of the most high God. I love the fact that my boy gets it, and I pray that he will help me recognize my needs under that pile of rubble the world tells me I ""need"". Cue Fernando Ortega's ""Give Me Jesus""... I'm out.

25165,4284264,"20,August,2004",2004-08-20,"   Okay... maybe not Waterloo, but it was close.  Picture it (Golden Girls reference there... Sophia is hysterical): Walgreens on a sticky Friday evening in August. A beautiful woman comes bounding down the toy isle toward an unsuspecting new father as he struggles to hold the child/car seat combo (see ""ton of bricks"") off of the nasty drug store floor. In her hands she carries them... the downfall of many a father's dreams, the scourge of the never-to-be future quarterback... the Care Bear. Ladies and gentlemen, I confess to you that my son is the owner of a Care Bear - Good Luck Bear as I am told. He has that one because there is a big shamrock on the front. If my boy is to grow up confused I can pray that he thinks we are Notre dame fans! Alas, I was defeated. You will be happy to know, however, that when Mama started talking about busting out the little boy Cabbage Patch demons the foot came down. Negative ghost rider, the somewhat-less-than-manly toy pattern is full.  Hallelujah for the weekend. Jack can holler all he wants tonight, because I can sleep until the Spirit moves me in the morning. If, however, he were to sleep all night but wake up at 6:00 a.m. I would be bitter... I don't want to see the clock until at least 9:00.  I have no profound wisdom for the blog today... some would say that is nothing new. I tried hard to see my world afresh today and had a few victories but many defeats. I just try to keep reminding myself to lift up my eyes. Strange that we are called to look away from the next step and lift our hands away from what ""holds us down"". Lay everything at His feet, turn your eyes toward Jesus and... well, when I develop the faith to try it for myself I'll tell you all about it. As a friend often says, you can't lead where you have not yet been. The first few steps down that road have been interesting - thanks for joining me on the journey.  Grace &amp; Peace,  PJ  "
25166,4284264,"19,August,2004",2004-08-19,"   Have you ever seen a baby pinecone? I was at Cumberland University today, trying like the dickens to sell some phones so that I can buy fun stuff for our 17-week old... and maybe a little sump'in sump'in for me (ncaa 2005 on the ps2). I was walking out with my boss after a so-so meeting and there it was - a tree full of baby pinecones. Who knew? I remember playing with them as a kid, my mom sitting them beside the fireplace... even kicking them around the yard (a poor man's soccer ball, if you will). Never, though, do I remember seeing baby pinecones.  Baby pinecones are plenty cool, but they are nothing compared to my little man. As I said, he is seventeen weeks old and is changing every day. His smiles are radiant, his eyes are as big and bright as the sky and his laugh is infectious. He is the coolest thing in the history of ever, period. Here's my fear, though: It has taken me the better part of seven years of marriage to figure out how amazing and beautiful my wife is, and I am learning that more every day. How can I, working 40+ hours a week, stressing over sales numbers and bills, insure that I will not look up years from now and be shocked to find my little man... well... a man? How can I not glance up from ""keeping my head down"" or ""my nose to the grindstone"" years from now and not find that I missed everything?  Final part of this thought: the same thing has happened in my walk with God. I lived 20+ years of life singing songs and attending services, all the while missing the bright, shining face of my Lord looking down on me - His child... his chosen. I was so busy watching for His hands to move that I never stopped to look up into His eyes. I love it when Jack looks at me and his face lights up in a huge smile. I love coming home in the afternoons and seeing my wife at the back door, babe in arms waiting for me to come in and give her a ""hoogle"" (better known as a hug). I love the notion of the God of creation singing over me and smiling as he watches me rock my son. My prayer is that my eyes will seek out the precious things God has put in my life and take them in fully.  I kind of like the fact that at 27 I am amazed at the sight of a baby pinecone... it makes me wonder what new sight awaits me tomorrow.  "
18048,4285920,"21,August,2004",2004-08-21,"   Last night i had the ""pleasure"" of chaperauing(spelling?) a Highschool dance. The school i teach at is a All boys prep school so needless to say it was a eruption of hormones on a Mt. Vesuvius sort of level. My job technically was to make sure nobody got to intimate with their partner on the dance floor. But c'mon... it's not really in my make up to be like ""hey get your hand off her ass"". Shit Go for it Lil Playa. I mean if she reaches up and smacks him across the face, that lesson will stay with the kid alot longer than if i was to scold him.  Also the young ladies at this dance were kill'n me. You would have thought it was ladies night at the mercury room by what they had on. Needless to say some of my buddies were fired up to go out afterwards, I on the other hand hit the rack because this morning we had a scrimmage down in LaMarque, Texas which is an hour away. So i figured I shouldn't expect my players to stay home and rest if im not so i packed it in much to my buddies chagrin. Im now back from the scrimmage and in search of a beer and a nap.   A burly Irishman is drinking in a bar. A tiny gay fellow sits beside him. After a few beers, the gay guy whispers, â€œDo you want a blow job?â€The gigantic man flips out, roars in anger, and tosses the little guy out of the bar, then returns to his stool.The shocked bartender says, â€œIâ€™ve never seen you react like that. What did that guy say?â€â€œDunno. Something about a job.â€  "

I almost wanted the ""crap the stripper stole my wallet"" feeling instead of the ""damn is email not enough, i must post random drivle for the internet masses"".I tried this once before but failed miserably. Now that I have something some what interesting to write about and a little more free time, i'll give it a go. Well i now have to get back to the exciting world of American History and how Columbus enslaved the indians.  There's a doctoer, a lawyer, a priest and a boy scout on a airplane. The plane is about to crash and there is only one parachute. The doctor says ""lets give it to the child, it's the humanitarian thing to do.""

Now I'm starting to think it's a curse. at the moment I'm a HighSchool football coach and my patience is wearing thin. Each day i tell these young men what to do and how to do it, but you would think i was i giving them advice on a horse at a derby race. So far I love my job. Maybe for the shear idea that from time to time some one listens to me and thinks I'm right and they recognize that. In my history class they take my word as gospell. Thats probably since i make the test. Out on the practice field the other team dictates if i did a good job or not.

7129,4287218,"22,August,2004",2004-08-22,"   And my life continues to stay full of weirdness. Last night I was pretty bored, I layed on the couch watching tv with my laptop on my lap. Then I got another email from CC. I am glad we are still friends. I missed him and Kenyon more than I realized. Kenyon can crawl already and say dada. I missed all that =(. In the end I fell asleep in bed around 3 am, while watching a movie. I kept waking up in the middle of the night feeling sick, running to the bathroom throwing up. I hardly slept again.  Today is the big day though, I hope the recording goes well for the radioshow. The intro's I got from Napalm are soooo tight! I am so happy with them. Chamelleon is making an intro for me also. He is the best. Tried to stay up to have it done for me, but he was too sleepy, did make me a shout out I can throw in the show. His song got the nr 9 spot on the top 10 request list on Royal Radio. This morning, he told me something, nobody ever told me before, not even a loved one. That meant a lot to me. He is such a good person, and I am so happy I got someone to share the same passion for music with. He always genuinely smiles with me whenever I am all excited about some music stuff. I defenitely have to shout him out tonight at the show.  I think I am done preparing everything for the show tonight so I might catch me a nap before its time to bounce. Dont forget to bring the PG cd's. Mah homies are doin da damn thang in NYC! So proud of them also.  Music was, is and will always remain my first love. It always makes me happy, keeps me happy, never disappoints me or lets me down. I love it. And thats an understatement. =) "
7130,4287218,"21,August,2004",2004-08-21,"   I just woke up. I actually slept for a change. I was watching a movie last night but I fell asleep, that hasnt happened to me in a while. Me and Devon had a huge fight just now on the phone. I hung up. Then a few later, he hit me back tellin me he sorry for hurting me and all. We had a real good talk about how this situation is. We kinda both figured out we probably dont match. I dont know, I guess its done. Blah.  The last thing I want is another insecurity about something. I already have enough insecurities to deal with, especially my health now. I have to go back to the hospital on Sept. 2nd. Do another biopsy to see if the lower tissue has cells that are effected too. Let's hope not. A few years ago I went through the same thing, alone. Now I still go through this, Alone. Nobody really cares, or maybe dont understand when I tell them. So I just dont tell them anymore. It just hurts more when you know that people know, but there is no support really. I am used to dealing with this alone so it doesnt really make a difference.  Funny how right now, after a good night sleep, my state of mind is pretty peaceful though. I have an important radioshow tomorrow so I am glad I am focused on what's important at the moment. I have to record the show and send it to Juize FM. They are interested in my (our, DJ Dynamite and myself) show. Let's hope they like the platform and decide to put the show on their station. That would be half a dream come true for me. Lord knows I worked hard enough for it...... "
7131,4287218,"20,August,2004",2004-08-20,"   I don't know what happened anymore. Last night I was real frustrated, usually a good night's sleep helps, but sleep is something I rarely get to enjoy nowadays. I set up this blog stuff to write stuff off of me, normally I start writing songs, but it seems like I am ""singing"" the same old songs over and over, so I try a different approach to deal with these feelings. Who knows, this might be a new therapeutic way of healing or maybe I should say ""improving"" the quality of my life. *shrugs*  Last night before I went to sleep (tried to that is) I talked to Tarik, a good friend. Last time we saw eachother was last month in Brooklyn. Now he moved from DC to St Maarten and spent his birthday last sunday on the beach there. I was so jealous. I am glad he had fun though. I told him about all the good things and bad things in my life going on right now. Its such an emotional rollercoaster really. Its like I can't even enjoy the good things and simply be ""happy"" about it cause the bad things are downing it so bad. So much, I don't even know how to feel anymore these days.  I always been good at business stuff, but personal stuff......blah. I just bury myself in the work I got and hopefully I dont have to deal with a personal life this way. Work keeps me happy right now. Music too as always. I just hope my health doesnt get in the way of the things I love to do. "
10214,4288065,"20,August,2004",2004-08-20,"    Howdy Yaâ€™ll,   Itâ€™s me again. I been sittinâ€™ here on my porch lookinâ€™ at all the sale papers that came in the mail. Itâ€™s time fer the youngâ€™uns to git back in school, so they got all the school stuff on sale. I never will understand what differnce a certain kind of notebook is gonna make in the way a youngâ€™un learns. I seen wired notebooks, zippered notebooks, colorful notebooks, plain notebooks, ones with movie stars pictures on â€˜em, ones with cartoons onâ€™em, and ones with ever color of the rainbow on â€˜em! They got regler pencils and fancy pencils, regler pens and colered pens and pens with special grips. Crayons now come in big boxes of 96 differnt colors, and paper is in ever color you could want to write on. They even got special stores that sell nothinâ€™ but school stuff!  They got them backpack things fer the youngâ€™uns to lug all this mess back and to in. The TV said the other day that doctors is worried about the youngâ€™uns back messinâ€™ up before they even get out of school to get a job! They just ainâ€™t no sense in any youngâ€™un totinâ€™ that much on their back! We didnâ€™t have to tote that much when we worked in the fields â€˜till we got older and big enough to handle it.  Can anybody out there prove to me that all this new fangled stuff is teachinâ€™ the youngâ€™uns any better? Most youngâ€™uns now ainâ€™t got sense enough to get out of the rain unless some game tells â€˜em to! The youngâ€™uns that make it to college are taking so long to graduate that they done got gray hair before they know what a job is! And when they do git a job, guess where they go first? To the store that sells all the school stuff so they can git fancy stuff fer their new jobs! â€˜Cept now, theyâ€™re called â€œofficeâ€ supplies! Donâ€™t make no sense to me, neither.  Since we done got all the supplies, are the teachers any better? I wonder. I see on them school calendars that they schedule teacher work days. These are days that the youngâ€™uns could be in school, but todayâ€™s teachers need the time to fix up report cards. I figered it shouldnâ€™t take â€˜em as long today â€˜cause they got them computers to do all the work. In my day, the teachers had to do the figurinâ€™ themselves, and the writinâ€™ themselves, and there werenâ€™t no such thing as settinâ€™ up an appointment to see your youngâ€™uns teacher. If you needed to see her, you just stopped by the school when you had a minute. Boy, if you try that now, theyâ€™d have you hauled off! Yet all the time you hear the teachers whininâ€™ about they cainâ€™t get the mamas and daddies involved in their youngâ€™uns schoolinâ€™! They need to learn that you cainâ€™t have it both ways. Either you want me there, or you donâ€™t. They need to learn that time is important to mamaâ€™s and daddies, too. Some mamaâ€™s got jobs, and those that donâ€™t got meals to cook, homes to clean, and probably got clothes to fold! Most daddies got jobs, too. They have to take off to go see the teacher. The least they can do is work with the man!  They need to learn that supplies donâ€™t teach the youngâ€™uns, good teachers do. What is wrong with the good, old fashioned ways of readinâ€™, writinâ€™, and arithmetic, as long as you throw in some of that computer stuff so the youngâ€™uns donâ€™t fall behind the rest of the world? Now a days, theyâ€™re teachinâ€™ girls how to be welders and boys how to cook. They got health and safety classes, babysittinâ€™ classes, and picture takinâ€™ classes. If the mamaâ€™s would teach the cookinâ€™, and daddies would teach the weldinâ€™, and we all raised our youngâ€™uns with a little common sense, and left the picture takinâ€™ as a hobby, they might find they could teach something that mattered.  Todayâ€™s youngâ€™uns ainâ€™t as dumb as most of yaâ€™ll think. They got plenty of brains to learn with. Itâ€™s just that what are we teachinâ€™ â€˜em? I was told one time to keep an open mind by some of the youngâ€™uns that I run up with. The only problem is that if your mind is always open, there ainâ€™t no tellinâ€™ who is goinâ€™ to dump what in there!   â€˜Till next time, Granâ€™ma Gertie "
10215,4288065,"20,August,2004",2004-08-20,"    Howdy Yaâ€™ll!   Welcome to the world of Granâ€™ma Gertie! I reckon I aught to interduce myself. I was borned Gertrude Maybell Smith somwheres around a hunderd years ago. I been married to the same old geezer fer what seems like forever. I got more granâ€™youngâ€™uns than a pear trees got blooms in springtime. I got my share of wrinkles, and my hairâ€™s been gray fer so long that I done fergot what color it used to be. Iâ€™ve always been a big olâ€™ strong gal. My daddy used to say it was â€˜cause I come from good stock. I was born and bred in the country, and never took a shine to the city. Except for my olâ€™ man. He was a city boy all the way, and thru and thru â€˜till I got hold of â€˜im! Had to teach him everything he knows. Now that you know a little bit about me, I reckon we can discuss a few things, you know, chew the fat a bit.  I reckon at my age, Iâ€™ll never git used to all the new things this world keeps cominâ€™ up with. Some of my granâ€™youngâ€™uns just spent around $300.00 dollars fer me a miker-wave. They said it would cook real fast. I just ainâ€™t figered out what they think a rotatinâ€™ light bulb is gonna cook! It does make a perty good shelf to put some of my what-nots on, though. I reckon Iâ€™d like the clock part too, ifâ€™n it didâ€™t blink 12:00 all the time! It seems to me that the women now-a-days have just about cut off their noses to spite their faces. What with all the new fangled gadgets and thing-a-ma-jigs they got now. Take them biscuits in a can fer instance. Now that they ainâ€™t got a use fer a rollinâ€™pin, what do they think theyâ€™re gonna WHOP their olâ€™ man with ifâ€™n he needs it? Only thing I can think of is to fix them sudden biscuits in a cast iron skillet and use that to hit him with.  They got telephones that do everything but make a phone call. I, fer one, sure donâ€™t like them answerinâ€™ machine things. I donâ€™t need some machine tellinâ€™ me to leave a message, I ainâ€™t so old I cainâ€™t call back! They got cars you have to plug in and teli-visions that you donâ€™t, addinâ€™ machines that are so little you gotta have a magnifyinâ€™ glass to use â€˜em, and radios so big it takes two people to tote â€˜em. They got perfume thatâ€™s sâ€™posed to smell like real vaniller flavorinâ€™, but they use imitation flavorinâ€™ in their cookinâ€™. They got take out food that sâ€™posed to taste like homemade, and their homemade taste like it should be took out, maybe to the dawgs!  Women used to know their place. Then some gal mustâ€™a thought we ought to get smart and start makinâ€™ us a new place. These modern women got things so messed up, Iâ€™m beginninâ€™ to wonder ifâ€™n we were better off where we were.  What with all the gadgets and such we got now, I donâ€™t know whether I wish we could go back to yesterday, or whether I should just keep hanginâ€™ on to see what the heck is next!!  â€˜Till next time, Granâ€™ma Gertie "
10216,4288065,"20,August,2004",2004-08-20,"    Autumn Afternoon  As I sit on the front porch using the last of the dayâ€™s light to glance over the evening paper, I feel the slight chill that has crept into the air. I have spent the late afternoon watching the golden brown leaves of the sycamore tree float slowly and gracefully to the ground. The pine straw is a bit heavy on the now browning grass in my front yard. I know I shouldnâ€™t be wasting my time just sitting on the front porch. I know I should be in the yard raking up the leaves as they fall. I just canâ€™t bring myself to leave my perch. I, after all, have a perfect autumn view. I can sit quietly listening to the birds getting ready to nest at evening light. I can watch the squirrels preparing themselves for the fast approaching winter. I can see the pink shimmer of an autumn evening sunset. I can smell the soft fragrance of a fireplace beginning to burn. I feel the cold breath of winter beginning to creep into the fast approaching night. My toes, poking out of the sandals that I have lived in since April, are suddenly quite nippy.  I know that soon, I will wake up to a yard that has been diamond studded with the first frost. All the leaves will have finally found their final resting place in my front yard. The children will be catching the school bus in the early twilight of morning wearing new sweaters and jackets. Thanksgiving and Christmas decorations will soon be showing up, glowing brightly in windows and dancing across lawns. The sound of chainsaws whining and axes cracking will be echoing across the neighborhood announcing the golden glow of fires and the perfume of smoke to come.  I almost hate to think about removing the fallen leaves from the yard. They are a signal of the coming changes. The slow, methodical grace of the leaves falling down is as graceful as the soft, gray, billowing of smoke coming up from the chimneys. The newly grounded leaves are the signal that winter is fast approaching. They act as a reminder to get out your winter coats and blankets. They tell you to winterize the lawn mower, to break out the rakes and leaf bags, and get the yard ready for colder weather. Listen to them.  I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll worry about the leaves today. I may not worry about them tomorrow, either. I may just spend the early fall sitting on my front porch. Just sitting and watching as the season shows her finest colors and changes moods as quick as the fall wind blows.  Then again, I may not have to rake them. Maybe there will be a good strong wind to blow them all away into the oblivion of my next door neighbors yard. I never liked her anyway. "
10217,4288065,"20,August,2004",2004-08-20,"    Tombstone Of A Home   Where there now stands a lonesome chimney, there once was a home. The chimney is all that remains as a testimonial that once upon a time, someone cared. With loving hands, each brick was carefully lain in a mortar of mud. Even though all traces of the home have long since disappeared, the chimney still proudly stands.  How many cold mornings did this chimney serve itâ€™s purpose? How many children were warmed by itâ€™s hearth? How many times has it warmed both soul and bottom, faces and hearts? How many times did the children of itâ€™s past warm their hands before going out into the cold, perhaps to school or to do their chores? How many times has a father warmed his feet and hands after working in the fields? How many clothes did the mother press with the flatirons that were heated here? How many ? How much? How many times? So many questions, so much history.  The lonesome chimney now stands as a grave marker in time. It has many memories that it could tell. It makes a person wonder if it had a mantle. If so, were the family portraits there? Maybe a bud vase of wildflowers given by a child. Think of the labor that went into the building of this chimney, and also of the building of the home and family that it warmed. It now serves as a reminder that long ago, someoneâ€™s father was young and strong enough to cut and split the wood for itâ€™s use. That long ago, someoneâ€™s mother was young and strong enough to keep that fire burning brightly.  The outline of the home can still be seen if you look hard enough and possibly have a little imagination. If you listen long enough, you can almost hear the voices and laughter of the family that once lived here. You can see where there might have been a rope swing tied in the ancient oak that still stands in what must have been the front yard. If you are lucky enough to be here in springtime, you may see some of the mothers now wild gladiola and tulip bulbs peeking through the soil. You can imagine where the clothesline was, where the garden, chicken coop, and hog pen must have been. You can see what could have been the childrenâ€™s favorite place to play, and where the mother kept watch over them. If you listen closely enough, you may even be able to hear the family dog scratching out a cool place in the sand under the porch that once stood here.  The mother and father that once lived here grew old and watched as they slowly lost everything. They were no longer young and strong enough for the old house. Life had called their children into a different way of life. Not better, not worse, just different. The children rarely visited after they grew up and moved away. Sometimes, the old couple would receive a photograph or letter from the grandchildren, but not very often. You know how busy our lives can be. The children decided that they were too old to remain in the house. Sometimes, the roof would leak and the cold breath of winter would come creeping in the cracks around the doors. After a lot of convincing, the couple was moved into a â€œretirementâ€ home. It was here that they passed away. The children never returned to the old home place.  Almost like a person, a home needs love to survive. When no one cared anymore, slowly, board by board, and nail by nail, the old house lost itâ€™s strength and gave up. No more laughter would fill itâ€™s rooms, no more dinners in itâ€™s kitchen, no more fires would burn. Maybe the chimney still stands in the hopes that someday, maybe a family will return. Maybe they will see how well it has stood the test of time and rebuild a new home around it. In the meantime, the lonesome chimney will continue to stand proudly, with the memories of the past. Always and always, forever hoping. "
10218,4288065,"20,August,2004",2004-08-20,"    If Only They Could Talk   I have always been what you could call a yard sale shopper. I cannot count the Saturday mornings spent with my family looking for that perfect bargain. I have furnished my home, bought gifts, clothed my entire family, met many interesting people, and saved plenty of money in the end. An estate sale, though, is an altogether different story.  For those who do not know, a yard sale is when people are cleaning out closets, re-arranging, moving, or making room for new things. They are held on lawns, porches, garages, or sometimes in living rooms when the weather is too cold or rainy. They are held in every month, with spring and summer being the best. They are held in big cities and small towns, and in neighborhoods everywhere. An estate sale, on the other hand, is often just as it says - the selling of a persons estate after death. Perhaps I have a melancholy view, but so be it.  I have attended several estate sales with my mother. She quite enjoys them, and has a different view than I. She feels it is a privilege to be able to purchase treasures that the family doesnâ€™t want or need. I feel it is an invasion into a persons personal life. Just a way for the adult children to dispose of family â€œjunkâ€ so as to settle everything before they return to their busy lives. I wonder if they would feel the same way if these items accumulated over the years could talk? If they knew the rich memories behind all of the family junk. If they knew what each piece had meant to the family member.....  Hello, I am  Grandfather Clock . I guess you could say I kept the time of this family, not just in minutes and hours, but in memories, too. It was me that father watched as each child was born into this family of mine. It was I who counted the time before the children went off to school, and before father went to work. My numbers taught the children to count. It was I that let out the chimes to signal bedtimes and curfews. Often, I was hated by the children because I signaled the end of some enjoyment, or the beginning of some dreaded chore. Over the years, Iâ€™ve seen the children come and grow and move away. It was I that was stopped when father passed away. I didnâ€™t know then if Iâ€™d ever run again, but just as life kept on, so have I. Simply standing in this hallway, ticking away the minutes of this families life. Now that mother has passed away, our home is being separated and sold. I wish I could tell them all the things I remember. My memories are for sale at the price of $ 55.00.  I am  Miss Mirror . I have hung in this hallway for over fifty years. I was a present from father to mother. He used to stand in front of me, with his hands wrapped around mother, and tell her how beautiful she was. Iâ€™ve seen so many smiles! Iâ€™ve watched as mother fixed her hair before going to church on Sundays. Iâ€™ve watched father check his tie. I watched as son and daughter primped and checked their looks before dates, prom nights, and weddings. I saw the children grow from babies amazed at their reflections, to proud adults. Iâ€™ve also seen the tears when the family was told of brothers death in a war, of sisters car crash, and all the little arguments of a family. Iâ€™ve seen so much, but can tell them so little. Iâ€™m not worn out or used up, but I guess Iâ€™m useless to son and daughter. If only they could unlock the memories I have. My price is only $ 35.00.  I am  Mrs. Rocker . Iâ€™m the one who watched sleeping babies in mothers arms. I remember all the nights of colic, fevers, chicken pox, and broken hearts. I remember all the sleepless nights mother spent with me while waiting for some member of the family to return safely home. Iâ€™m the one who stayed up with father when he sorted out problems ranging from a disagreement with mother, to how to pay for daughters wedding. Iâ€™ve seen more worry than most of the house, but Iâ€™ve seen plenty of joy, too! Like the time mother discovered sons first tooth while nursing him right here! And the time mother discovered what it felt like to rock a grandchild for the first time. So many memories wrapped up for the small price of $ 45.00.  I am  Mr. Hammer . I supposedly belonged to father, but spent most of my time with mother. Oh, sure, father used me from time to time. To fix a few things like the nail in the front steps that keeps coming up, or putting up targets for sons first BB gun. Mostly though, I was used by mother. To open stuck windows, open paint can lids, and pull out old nails. I was once used to threaten a sewing machine that wouldnâ€™t cooperate with mother while she was making a quilt for daughters wedding! Iâ€™ve had a few new handles over the years, but I work just like new. It seems with my experience, I would be worth more that the price tag of $ 2.00.  My name is  Ladle , and I guess Iâ€™m the speaker for the kitchen crew. I assume we are the least thought of because we are the cheapest priced. We range from a dime to a dollar. We all wonder if son and daughter remember all the after school snacks, sleep-over party favors, birthday cakes, and Sunday dinners that came from us and mother. Nothing could make us feel better than to see their smiling faces after they had finished eating mothers homemade cookies or special Saturday muffins. The things she made for this family were pure labors of love. The kitchen was so hot in the summer. We didnâ€™t have fans or air conditioning. Mother always made things from scratch, never from a box. Everything in this kitchen speaks of her love for this family. We wonder if our new families will have that same love, or will we be considered outdated and thrown away at the end of this sale. If only we could talk!  With the breakdown of the family unit, it seems to me that some of us have forgotten just what the word family means. Think about your life. About your parents and your childrenâ€™s lives. Will your children hold memories, or an estate sale price tag at the end of your life? How about you? Will you hold a tag, or will you remember the smiles of a gift given? You know, the trinket box you gave to your mother when you were little? Will you remember the fishing trips with you father when you see his old tackle box, or will you see the price of a lure? Look in your home today. Remember where you got each little knick-knack, each picture. Sure, some things may have no sentimental value, but what about the things that do? Think about these things the next time you see.......  *ESTATE SALE* 1234 ANY STREET YOUR TOWN, USA SATURDAY 9AM TO 2 PM "
24301,4293254,"23,August,2004",2004-08-23,"   I'm glad in a sense my masks aren't working, but in another I wish I'd stop crying. I'm coming off as pissed off to some teachers. Yes I am down. I'm down, that my boyfriend is leaving for Elon this weekend. His parent's won't let him have the fucking car even though he's paid at least a good $1000 on it. And it's not like they need it either considering they have two cars already. I'm overwhelmed by my honors classes and I doubt the homework will be letting up anytime soon. I know I'm screwed for this year. I'm going to end up at the bottom of my class I see it already. I'm a failure. I wish they'd stop posting grades because I compare myself to others(even though the names aren't listed). I see it already. Branded across my forehead: FAILURE AT LIFE! I can't believe what I've become. I love my hate myself and hate myself all in one futile breath. Is this all I think to myself, before I pull my face out from the pillow in the morning. Sometimes I wish I could lie there all day. Somedays I think I'm dead walking around in some girls body, then again maybe I am... Maybe this is just the clueless ramblings of my depression. Why am I this way? Am I getting suicidal I think to myself? I constantly think of placing the knife into my veins over and over again until I'm drenched in blood. Is this a beautiful thought? I don't know. This quickly moves out of my head. I'm better now, I don't want to return to the places I've been I can do better than THAT. I'm soooo fucked up right now, then again, when will I not be fucked up? -Nikki "
24302,4293254,"20,August,2004",2004-08-20,"   Hello to the World that doesn't know I exist, Today, when I went into to Chemistry I Honors we were suppose to turn in our measuring the thickness of foil project(which I pretty much felt like I did the whole project), a couple of the people in my group came up to me and asked if I had turned it in. When I replied with a quiet ""yes,"" they didn't respond or anything they just walked away. I didn't receive a thanks or anything. This is after I discovered how to find out how thick a piece of foil is by doing research, typing up and editing all the bull shit they screwed up on, and so forth. Maybe I am being a little hasty, but my time is very valuable to me. Last night I didn't have time to finish all my homework because I was editing ""OUR"" paper. I though a group paper, was suppose to be a group ""effort."" Next time I'm doing the work on my own. Christ, I might as well. -Nikki "

At church I only had one kid in my room which I was glad because if I had more I'd probably loose them and their parents would be very afraid. My psychologist told me I need to think of positive things I like about myself: I like: that I look older than my age, my hair, my smile, my eyes, you know something I never realized this, but I think the reason why my mind is always thinking about kind of sad things is because I kind of enjoy thinking about my life... I mean my life is like the average american family. Which says a lot for society. Hmmm.... Woah... Off topic AGAIN!!! Anyways I have some Honors reading assignments I have to do so I better go.

Or for Mrs. Kraft? For the school? Or for who? -I broke down today at school though, I started crying in the hallway, what was I crying over? Stress I suppose, and I was extremly overwhelmed. My homework is rough, not rough, but when it adds up in all 7 classes it covers my night. Boy, am I glad I don't have a job I'd be screwed over. I'll stick with Church. I'm so depressed right now...

Why is life so fucking difficult? I mean yes I know ""no body said life was going to be easy,"" but fuck how in the great glorius world could so much drama and shit happen to me. Let's see... Both of my brothers suffer from different forms of schizophrenia along with depression, my mom has MS and refuses to use her crutches even when she's in extreme pain, my father is so fucked up he doesn't realize others have feelings and has so many money problems I don't even want to think about it. God, you know, sometimes I look around at people and think why do you have it so fucking good? Who said you could have everyone worship you? I have an idea next time your MOM HAS TROUBLE WALKING OR IS HAVING SPASMS YOU CAN TAKE THE DAY OFF FROM SCHOOL TO TAKE CARE OF HER? HOW 'BOUT THAT UH?? You know WHAT AND THE NEXT TIME A TEACHER SAYS THEIR TIME IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN MINE I CAN TELL THEM WHAT I'M GIVING UP TO BE THERE, because you know what- they've had their parent's their parent's have supported them, but what about me? ASS HOLESS, ASS HOLES!!! ALSO NEXT TIME I WORK MY ASS OFF AT CHURCH I HOPE EVERYONE NOTICES THE SHIT I GO THROUGH FOR ALL YOU PEOPLE BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT I WORK SO DAMN HARD TO GET THE MONEY I GET, SO DON'T WHINE AND BITCH ABOUT HOW LITTLE OF A PAYCHECK YOU GOT, BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT MY PARENTS DON'T HAVE THE MONEY YOUR FAMILIES HAVE? SO TAKE A STEP BACK AND LOOK AT ALL THE FUCKING THINGS YOU HAVE THAT YOU HAVE THAT I DON'T AND YOU KNOW WHAT, STOP BITCHING ABOUT HOW YOUR PARENT'S SUCK BECAUSE ONE DAY YOU will need them more than ever, and you know what they'll be gone. Why am I sitting here writing such an angry letter to the world, a huge part of it is because I'd like to be said ""goodbye"" to or invited to go along with some of you guys to the things you do? You know what I don't hate you, I'm jealous of everything that you have that I don't. Lisa- I'm jealous that your dad cares about you enough to look at you, and that people are constantly taking care of you, even though this is also a bad thing. Sofie- Your slimness, and occassionally your humor even though it can be brutal. Miranda- Your so sweet,and kind and I think you really do love yourself deep down. Sara G.- Your parents even though you hate them soooo much they are able to be REAL with you, and tell you what they think, oh and lets not forget that its good to have our baby fat! Karen- Your ability to keep a secret, and hold it... I will finish this later.. I do love you all but please realize I'm human too... love,Nikki "

I got to school around 8 am and then left around 4pm in the evening. Mom and I headed to the bank because on tuesday the atm ate my check without crediting my account. After taking care of that we drove my Wendy's to pick up something. God I hate fast food, it's so greasy, but we didn't have time to make anything, so I settled for a small burger, fries and a frosty. After wiping off the grease I finally ate my food. Stopped in at home to change then we went back to DSA (my school) for Orientation. Orientation was okay, but didn't realize until later that I didn't get Chemistry Honors like I had signed up for which makes me ANGRY!!! But I put in a drop add form and I'm a little worried might change the status of my Honors Envir. Science Class, but I was told it wouldn't. Anywho, later when I got home I talked to John on the phone for a little while. I really enjoyed it, I couldn't stop laughing, we're going to go bar hopping on Sunday! YAHOO! lol Anyways I have to go, I'm sitting on my floor in the buff, so yeah, I'm hungry... lol buh bye love,Nikki "

Well at 4pm I headed over to my mom's work and about 5 mins later headed over to Carrboro for my writing class. I was late for my writing class by about 20 mins. as usual. After the class ended around 6pm I had to wait around for an hour. During that hour I was learning or rather attempting to learn how to hemp... geez I suck at hemping. Sorry John, I had a cool idea for a new bracelet for you too... That's another thing, I was thinking alot today about how it turned out I wasn't going to be able to go to game night right after I promised John S. I'd come. My mom is having issues though right now with what John and I had talked about. Hmmm.... Anywho .... I'm really tired and I have to go to school again tomorrow to continue working and organizing the newspaper stuff so I better go to bed... hehehe GO TO BED... With who?? no one :( lol love,Nikki "
24308,4293254,"03,August,2004",2004-08-03,"   I can't believe all the crazy things that happened this past weekend. The weird part of it is, is that everything is working out okay, I guess. It seems interesting the way Sofie called me a blabber mouth a while ago, and then wonders why she ""bothers"" me. I guess why Sofie suddenly comes to mind is because of all the people invovled in this situation I think she could be the one to ""handle"" it better. I understand where Drew came from, yes he did break a few bonds, but it's not like John didn't already know who liked him. It's rather obvious. The thing is, is that I don't think people realized how close John and Nicole were because the way everyone is acting right after they broke up is insane. I don't know this is just my opinion, maybe I'm rather confused. All I know is I care about John and I hope he takes his time recooperating. love,Nikki "

She's lovely and I hope she likes the house as much as we do.  We were thinking of getting someone for the furnished third bedroom and I put a advert up at the local university. The first, and only response so far was from this total idiot. I will copy my advert and then the email conversation between myself and the idiot below it.   ROOM AVAILABLE Single room in extremely sunny house is available. Room is furnished with dresser, bed and wardrobe. Room would suit a mature, independent person. Room is in a lovely furnished, spacious home with a deck, 2 living areas, back yard and lots of Sun. $120 including: phone rental, power, gas and basics such as dishwashing liquid etc. (Toll calls excluded.)

We are both meat eaters but as we wouldn't be sharing food we wouldn't have a problem unless you did? We are just moving in so we were thinking of having people through next week sometime. Would you be available?       idiot says:  yes, is there anywhere to park my car around there!!!! I just got it towed away!!!!!       My response:  Yes, there are car parks available outside on the street. My partner has a vehicle which we park on the street and we find it very safe.  We have had a few people come through and have a look so it would be a good idea if you are interested to come have a look in the next 2 afternoons before we make a decision.  Today or tomorrow between 4:30 and 6:30 is best for us. Email me back with a time if you can make it.        idiot says:   alright then where do I go, how about 3?        My response:  No, that's not good for us because we will be at work. Can you make a time between 4:30 - 6:30 possibly like I originally said.      I give up, I tried to give him the benefit of the doubt but this guy is just a totally twit and obviously have terrible communication skills and pays no attention to details. I think I decided to give up when he asked if he could come over at 3 when I had said in the previous email It had to between 4:30 and 6:30.   "

Sorry Joe..He.    We struggled through the weather, boxes and boxes of items, large heavy furniture and millions of steps for two days, I was almost happy to come to work this morning.    Its all been worth it because we have found possibly one of the nicest places in the area ( in our price range of course ). It has two large living areas, a super huge bedroom, 2 sunny spare rooms , heaps and heaps of sun and best of all a deck that looks out over Evans bay. We are really stoked.   "

21519,4312005,"23,August,2004",2004-08-23,"   Olympics are being held in Greece, that's one of our neighbors, one of our bordering countries. Albanians have had a long big time, mainly informal conflict with Greeks. Itâ€™s all about territorial subjects; Greeks claim that actually the southern part of Albania is Greek, while Albanians (Tchams) were kicked out of northern Greece with their houses burnt 100 or so years ago.  Relationships between Albania and Greece looked like were going to get better after the elections in Greece, because the new-coming Greek Prime Minister claimed that Albanian immigrants (theyâ€™re a lot) would have a better treatment after he came in power. He came in power but there was not any big change.  So what does it have to do with Olympics?  One Albanian athlete and two Albanian weightlifters played as Greeks at the current Olympics, as they have been doing for 10 years by now. You have Mirela Manjani, that holds (till 1 year ago, I donâ€™t know about now) the Pike-throwing world Record. Pirro Dhima (naturalized as Spyros Dimas in Greece), who won some weightlifting gold medals in the last two Olympics and won bronze this year. And last but not least, Luan Shabani (Leonidas Sabanis I think :D) who is also a great medal holder, but who  unfortunately  was disqualified for doping (everyone was happy in Tirana about that).  Yes, Greece offers them much more money that Albania does. Yes, Greece gives them much better ways to train that Albania does. Yes, Greece gives them the Greek nationality which is much more useful that the Albanian one. But that does not mean you have to revolutionize your nationality. Mr. Dimas stated that he is proud to be Greek; reality check Spyros, you were born in Albania, like it or not you had and will have Albanian blood in your body for all your life, you are Albanian.  In the other side you can see Slave athletes playing for Greece. Well they never say they are Greek. Actually they always say they are from Serbia or Macedonia or every other country they are from. They accept the fact that they are playing for Greece, and they like it, but they donâ€™t fuck with their nationality.  Last paragraph is about the Greek team that takes part in the Olympics that are being held in Athens (Greece). Out of 8 weightlifters that take part in the Greek team, only 2 of them are Greeks. And what about the Greek baseball team? There is no one there who was actually born in Greeceâ€¦That makes you think :)!  Thatâ€™s it for now!  j. "

21521,4312005,"23,August,2004",2004-08-23,"   Itâ€™s an original title, isnâ€™t it?  Well the thing is this, people in Albania, and mainly in the Balkans consider drinking coffee a sport :). Every teenager has more-or-less the same agenda during summer afternoons. At about 18:00 you start getting yourself prepared for going out. You will need 15 minutes if you are a male and an hour or so if u are a female.  Than you go out of your home, take either a bus or a taxi, and go to ""The Block"". Yeah it looks like a fancy name, actually it was the place where communist leaders had their homes during the communist regime here, today it is totally transformed..! After you arrive at ""The Block"" and meet your friends, you go to your favorite bar/coffee-shop/cafÃ© and stay there for at least 1 hour and a half. And what do you do? Just chat!  So how will I survive without my 1~2 daily coffee-drinking hours? Where will I find a place to spend at least half an hour drinking a damn cup of coffee so I will feel like home...Will I really have time for that?  j. "
21522,4312005,"23,August,2004",2004-08-23,"   Hi Everyone (anyone)!      It's 3:53 in the morning at this moment, and I just decided i have to start a blog! I live in Tirana, Albania. I have been living here for 6325 days, 151800 hours...I was actually born here :)! Well here it comes, i'm moving to Toronto, Canada the 8th of September...  This is just the first post but i would like to say so many things. I'm sure a lot of people will not consider my moving a big deal. I think that's normal. At this precise moment, i don't consider it a big deal neither so your question will be: -""Than, why are you creating this blog?"". Well the answer for me is simple. I'm sure that when i will actually go to Toronto and settle there my feelings, my emotions, my thoughts about this moving will change.  I love Tirana. I love Albania. I love Albanian. I love Albanians. But i'm bored of each of them.  So the imminent result of this blog will be to describe my last 14 or so days in Tirana, and than my new life in Toronto.  That's it for the first post!  j. "

9350,4312209,"23,August,2004",2004-08-23,"   A long time ago, somewhere in Europe, There is a big town called, Luxtenberg, it is where the King lives, it is the heart of most activities and the place where important people and the wise goes to. Gwerlexine is the second biggest city. It existed a day walking to the East of Luxtenberg, pass the Green temple, and another day through the Brivisile, little village that famous for the grape wine.      Ethan used to live in the Louisene village, in the south of Gwerlexine, before the village was flattened to the ground of the earth, by the Saverest's soldiers. The Louisene was a place where some wizards and witches used as a meeting point, because of some mystical athmosphere in the area. Ethan is an orphane now. He was eight when he left home. His parents where accused as wizards, and so they were assasinated. Ethan was saved, by a man. Somehow, this man, has mysterious and wild look in his eyes. He has the eyes that challange others. He is tall and average in size. This man grabbed Ethan into his black cloak. He was hooded, may be that's why no one saw them, that was what Ethan thought. He didn't say a word. His hand covered Ethans mouth, so that he won't scream. When the Louisene was burnt, he grabbed Ethan's father's necklace and put it around Ethan's neck, gave him a little smile and left whithin the shadow in the forest. Ethan was confused. He saw something flew over the air, towards him. It was a scrap of paper with notes.. it says :      East is where you suppose to go river will guide you so do the truth faithful and loyality are the keys find the door of wise and wisdom      Ethan stood for a while, and he decided to go to the Owlhom river. It's the river where he used to go to. Ethan is bright and full of curiousity, and adventurous spirit. He walks into the forest without fear, but curiousity. He found the Owlhom river. He looks down into the water. There is only his reflection. He looks in once again, and surprised because he saw another face looks back at him. That face is as clear as the river, with blue and silvery scales, whole black eyes and fish like face.      ""Dear boy, are you Ethan?"" Ethan is a little hesitate to answer,"".. Yes i am.. sir.."" ""I've been told to guide you to the east city, Gwerlexine. now, my name is Edourise. Ethan, would be be kind enough to show me your necklace?"" So Ethan shows him the necklace. It took the shape of an small blade, with a gemstone. It was half blue and half orange, blended in between.  "
