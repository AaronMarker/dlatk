3215,4088894,2004-07-30,"I have been a member of the Dragonswood site for quite a while now & am pleased to say that recently, I was asked to write a regular column for their magazine (which, incidentally, is now available in some shops over in the USA & even NZ, as well as quite a few here in the UK). My first column is in the latest issue (out for Lammas & Mabon) & *puffs out chest with pride* is one of the featured articles mentioned on the front cover. I'm pleased as punch over that, I have to say, as this is my first professional writing venture (I've only ever written items for Triptych which I produce myself before now). Anyway, I thought I'd pop the article up here too & provide a link to the Dragonswood website, where you can order the magazine direct from them:  urlLink http://www.dragonswood.org.uk/index.php    THE ARTICLE:  Simple Witchery By Mabon   What is Simple Witchery?  As long as I can remember, Iâve always liked to keep things as simple as possible â I never saw the point in taking a complicated route if a simpler one presented itself to me. This isnât laziness, just common sense, from my point of view. Itâs something that has bothered me for a long time, this need people often seem to feel to complicate things which neednât be so hard, and so I set out to boil things down to their barest components, take out all things unnecessary & just get things done.  This is, essentially, what Simple Witchery is all about; leaving out all the extraneous information & implements, taking advantage of what we have ready to hand, & simply enjoying the flow of things. I hope that with this column, I can share some of this with all of you, & perhaps even get you thinking of ways to simplify things in your own, unique way!   Why Simple Witchery?  When you lift out all the superfluous items, you are left with the most important element of the Craft. Which element is that? Earth? Air? Fire or Water? Perhaps Spirit? No, none of these. The most important element is always YOU; the person living it & experiencing all it has to offer. When you learn to rely on yourself & your own abilities, you learn that nothing is impossible, you can do anything you set your mind to. Thatâs what itâs all about; setting your mind to something & getting it done.  For example, I donât use a wand in any or my work. Yes, I own one â a very ornate & beautiful one which was given to me by a very close friend â but I see it as purely a decoration for my home & it sits on a cherry wood stand atop my bookcase, where I can see it whenever I look up. It has never & will never be used by me or anyone else. Why? Because it doesnât need to be. I have no need of a wand when I have myself. Besides, what if at some point I had to cast in an emergency & found myself without my wand, what would I do? Panic? Well, thatâs not really very sensible, is it? Iâd do whatever needed to be done without my wand & it would work every bit as well as it would while using a wand!  Basically, all you need to get yourself started is focus of will & energy. Once you get the hang of that, thereâll be no holding you back & no end to the things you can accomplish. Over the coming issues, Iâll be exploring more of Simple Witchery &, hopefully, taking you along for the ride. I really hope youâll find it fun!   Tâis the Seasonâ¦  These are some very simple rituals for the coming Sabbats â ones I use myself. I hope youâll enjoy them.   Lammas (1st August)  Lammas is the first of the harvest festivals & celebrates the beginning of us reaping what we have sown earlier in the year. It is traditionally a time for feasting, having fun, & preparing ourselves for a little more hard work before the harvest is done!   On the Altar:  Large beeswax candle Lengths of green & red cord Wine, bread & honey   The Ritual:  Cleanse and cast the circle.Light the beeswax candle. Knot the piece of red cord and pass it over the candle, circling the base. Think of all that is passing and the sacrifices you have made. Give them up freely as you pass the red cord over the flame. Knot the green cord and pass it over the candle to lie on top of the red cord. This represents the achievements which will be built on your sacrifices â your harvest. Consecrate the wine and drink in honour of the Sun's power and your own achievements. Consecrate the bread and honey, and take them to the four corners saying:  'This is my offering;   This is my sacrifice.'  (Move round the circle deosil (clockwise) starting at North) Spread the honey on the bread. Eat and drink, communing with the season, saving some to put into the Earth as an offering later. Close the circle.   Mabon (22nd September)  Mabon is the Autumnal Equinox; a time of balance between darkness & light. But after this, the days will begin to grow shorter & the nights will draw in earlier. As the second of the harvest festivals, we celebrate it with the many orchard fruits which are now in season.   On the Altar:  An ear of corn Dried leaves A deep purple candle Wine & bread   The Ritual:  Cleanse and cast the circle.Light the purple candle and think about the meaning of the season. Name the dried leaves for anything to be swept out of your life. Drop them deliberately to the floor to be swept up later (keep them to scatter into running water). Pick up the corn and say:  'The God has descended into the land.   Now he makes His journey into the Underworld.   Days grow dim, nights grow long, but we do not weep,   For behold, he has left his seed as a promise of his return!'  Take the corn and bread deosil (clockwise) round the circle, stopping at each corner and saying:  'This is the seed and this is my harvest.'  Direct healing thoughts towards any part of the world where there is famine. Eat the bread and drink to the Lord and Lady. Close the circle.   Seasonal Project:   Goddess Eye  A Goddess eye is said to watch over & protect the home, & makes a wonderful gift for a like-minded friend. Making something yourself means it is very personal & the effort put into it gives it that little bit extra power. Hang it in the window to catch the light.  Materials required:  2 sticks on roughly equal length Yarn or embroidery threads of various colours Scissors (to cut the threads of course!)  Method:  Make a slipknot on the end of the thread you will use for the centre of the cross & slide the loop over the 2 sticks. Once the thread is centred, pull the knot tight & spread the stick arms out into the form of a cross. Wrap the thread diagonally over the centre twice for each side (NW-SE, then NE-SW) Start wrapping the thread around the sticks (moving deosil around the eye). Start at one point, move the thread over the stick, come round the back crossing over the front & move onto the next arm, keeping the thread tight. When you want to change to another colour, hide the knot at the back of the stick so the ends can't be seen. When you're finished, double-loop the thread over the last arm. You can decorate the ends of the arms with leather, beads or feathers â however you like. To hang the eye up, add a loop in the same colour as the thread nearest the outer edge, by pushing the ends through the eye (about an inch or so down the arm) from the front, then pushing the ends back through to the front again higher up, then tying a knot to form a loop. This should hold the eye upright when it's hung up.   Kitchen Witch   Herb Scented Flat Bread  This flatbread doesn't contain yeast, so it's quick and simple to make. You can substitute your favourite herbs for the ones suggested. A delicious recipe to use for ritual or any time. Makes 3.  Ingredients:  1 cup plus 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon finely chopped fresh sage 1 teaspoon finely chopped fresh chives 1 teaspoon finely chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley 2 1/2 tablespoons vegetable shortening 3 tablespoons milk 1/2 teaspoon coarse salt, for sprinkling 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, for brushing  1. In the bowl of a food processor, combine the flour, baking powder, salt, sage, chives, and parsley; process for 5 seconds to combine. Add vegetable shortening and process until well combined, about 15 seconds. Add milk and 2 tablespoons water, and process until the dough comes together, about 7 seconds.  2. Transfer dough to a lightly-flowered surface and knead for about 1 minute, forming it into a ball. Cover with plastic wrap and let stand for 30 minutes.  3. Heat the over to 200Â° with a baking sheet set on the rack. Heat a medium cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat until very hot. Meanwhile, cut the dough into 3 equal pieces and form each piece into a ball. On a lightly floured surface, roll one of the pieces of dough out into a very thin circle (it should be less than 1/16 inch thick and about 6 1/2 inches in diameter). Using a fork, prick the dough 7 or 8 times. Lightly brush one side of the dough with olive oil and sprinkle it lightly with salt.  4. Transfer round of dough, with the oiled side down, to the hot skillet and reduce heat to medium; cook until surface is covered with golden to dark-brown speckles, about 1 to 2 minutes on each side. If the flatbread begins to burn, lower the heat and continue to cook.  5. Remove bread from skillet and transfer to the baking sheet in the oven. Repeat the rolling and cooking process with the remaining 2 pieces of dough.  6. Cut the bread into wedges with a pizza wheel or sharp knife, and serve warm.",female,27,indUnk,Libra,1
3216,4088894,2004-07-30,"Well, this weekend is going to me quadrupally special for me: Not only is it a full moon tomorrow night, but it is also a blue moon (the second full moon in a calendar month). Then on Sunday it is Lammas (one of the eight Sabbats in the Wheel of the Year) AND my first wedding anniversary!  Yes, one year ago, Dale & I both stood up in front of a bunch of our friends & family to say words along the lines of ""I do"". Where has the time gone? It's quite literally flown by so fast that I can scarcely believe it. It certainly doesn't feel like a year already. It was odd enough last month when I realised that my best friend, Sarah, had been married a whole year (there was a whole spate of weddings last summer, you see!) & now it's MY turn. I can honestly say it's been fantastic so far, but people keep asking how it feels to be married & all I can say is that it doesn't really feel any different to us than we did before! We were already living together & both knew we wanted to spend the rest of our lives together - it was just a case of formalising it & making it legal. Perhaps I feel a little more secure now, but other than that, it's exactly the same. Just as well I was happy enough before, isn't it?  So, Dale & I are returning to the hotel where the deed was done, for dinner & an overnight stay, with breakfast in bed, to celebrate.  Anyway, other than our anniversary, I have the other important celebration to think about - Lammas! A little information is possibly called for here, I suppose. Lammas is the first of the three harvest festivals (the fifth of the year as a whole) & is generally held on or around 1st August. It celebrates the harvesting of the first crops as well as the first fruition of projects begun at the start of the year - we reap as we sow. It is also known as Lughnassadh (pronounced Loo-nah-sah) - the feast of the God, Lugh, who is sacrificed as he is cut down with the corn & reborn as the bread, providing food for all.  Some traditional associations are:  Traditional Foods:  Apples, Grains, Breads and Berries.  Herbs and Flowers:  All Grains, Grapes, Heather, Blackberries, Sloe, Crab Apples, Pears.  Incense:  Aloes, Rose, Sandalwood. Sacred GemstoneCarnelian.  Special Activities:  As summer passes, many Pagans celebrate this time to remember its warmth and bounty in a celebrated feast shared with family or Coven members. Save and plant the seeds from the fruits consumed during the feast or ritual. If they sprout, grow the plant or tree with love and as a symbol of your connection with the Lord and Lady. Walk through the fields and orchards or spend time along springs, creeks, rivers, ponds and lakes reflecting on the bounty and love of the Lord and Lady.  I've never been much of a one to go in for long rituals, so the one I use (when I use one at all) goes along these lines:   On the Altar:  Large beeswax candle Lengths of green & red cord Wine, bread & honey   The Ritual:  Cleanse and cast the circle. Light the beeswax candle. Knot the piece of red cord and pass it over the candle, circling the base. Think of all that is passing and the sacrifices you have made. Give them up freely as you pass the red cord over the flame. Knot the green cord and pass it over the candle to lie on top of the red cord. This represents the achievements which will be built on your sacrifices â your harvest.  Consecrate the wine and drink in honour of the Sun's power and your own achievements. Consecrate the bread and honey, and take them to the four corners saying: 'This is my offering; This is my sacrifice.' (start at the North then move round the circle deosil) Spread the honey on the bread. Eat and drink, communing with the season, saving some to put into the Earth as an offering later. Close the circle.  I don't think I'll be performing a ritual this year, so I'll probably just spend some time outside, somewhere green, & meditate a while instead - the Lord & Lady seem to be happy enough with that arrangement, so it should be more than enough.  I wish you all a special Blue Moon celebration & a fruitful harvest this Lammas! Blessings, Mab.",female,27,indUnk,Libra,1
3217,4088894,2004-07-30,"Well, I've never run a blog before, but I guess a wee introduction would probably be the best place to start, so here goes:  I'm a 27 year old married female who happens to be a practicing solitary Witch & have been for around 13 years now. I've forged my own Path along the way; a Path I call Simple Witchery. So, what does that mean, exactly? Well, I boil everything down to its barest components & take out all the extraneous bumf & hooha, so that what is left is the barest of essentials. I don't go in for big, fancy rituals & ceremonies - most of my magick takes place in the kitchen or the bathroom & is very firmly based in the mundane - it's a part of my everyday life, not something I do on the weekends or a couple of evenings a month. I am very much interested in spellcraft - the science of magick - & also the artsy-craftsy side of it (ie making things to use as part of a spell, such as poppets, amulets, talismans, or just the little things like a bag to put all the components in!). I'm also very interested in the use of herbs in healing.  Outside of my Craft interests, I am an avid reader - everything from horror to fantasy, comedy to biography - I just devour them all! I also spend a fair bit of time writing, not just calligraphy (which I love), but I edit a small local Pagan newsletter (Triptych) & also write a regular column for Dragonswood magazine. Music plays a huge part in my life - my husband plays guitar & sings, while I just sing - we spend a lot of time listening to rock & metal music (our favourite band is Dream Theater). Movies are another shared interest - just about any genre you care to name is represented in our DVD collection.  And that's a brief introduction to ME. No doubt as I write more, more will be revealed...",female,27,indUnk,Libra,1
3218,4088894,2004-08-20,"Well, I've attempted, several times lately, to make an entry, but for some reason, the net seems to see me as the enemy lately & keeps booting me off without complying with my meagre requests!  Karl has begun work on the site construction for Lone Witch, so Esk & I will be getting together with him tomorrow night to work on the design & layout some.  I can hardly wait to see these first stages complete & then move onto a working version so we can get started!  It's going to take quite a while to transfer all the existing files from the old Yahoo group to the new site & get all the existing members over there & settled in.  Then we have to wait for the new members to start arriving...  Watched aprogramme on the Aberdeen Witch Trials this evening.  Although it didn't give much more information than I already knew, it was quite interesting & I've recorderd it for a pal in America who has a connection to Aberdeen & the whole Witch Trials thing (that was how we met online, actually!).  I think he'll find it quite absorbing...  In between all this, I've begun a new regime - in an attempt to shift this last half stone to get to my target weight, I have started a fitness routine.  I originally decided on swimming twice a week & visiting the gym once a week too.  Unfortunately, my gym plans have been scuppered for now, as they aren't giving any more inductions for the equipment till the new term starts (so I'll have to wait a few weeks till all the students get back).  Anyway, I've been swimming twice this week & have realised that the only reason anyone LIKES exercising is that it feels so good when you STOP!  I never realised how blissful a shower could feel - sinking into a bath is usually my choice, but after a hard sesh in the pool, the shower feels like paradise!  ""So, why don't you just use magick to get rid of the flab, Mab?"" I hear the cynics cry!  Well, it's like this; I've always held that real Witchcraft is knowing when to use magick & when not to.  For instance, if I decided to just try & magick away the weight it couldn't work - you have to put in the effort.  Magick always takes the path of least resistance, so if you cast a spell to lose weight but then pig out, it ain't gonna work!  If, however, you put in the effort, cut down on the fat & do some exercise, then cast a spell to help keep you focused, enhance your willpower & boost your energy, then you'd be onto a winner.  This is exactly what I've done & let me tell you, I'm feeling better than I've felt in a VERY long time.  I'm already feeling more energetic & although my arms ache from all the swimming, I'm already feeling healthier & satisfied that I'm doing what I can to get into good shape.  Although it doesn't half get you knackered!",female,27,indUnk,Libra,1
3219,4088894,2004-08-13,"Well, that was my first week back at work & I discover the senior secretary is pregnant, so come February, I'll have even MORE work to contend with! Been rushed off my feet all week long & am SO glad it's Friday night now & I have the whole weekend at my disposal. So, what shall I do with my time?  Well, this Witch has decided she's getting a little flabby & could do with some toning up, so I've decided to check out the gym facilities at the University along with the pool there. I'll be dragging poor Esk up there to check it out with me too. Have decided on an action plan: I will swim twice a week on Tuesday & Thursday nights after work, & go to the gym on Saturdays. That way I'll be nice & trim by Yule & able to wear a slinky little number for New Year - HURRAH!  ""So, why don't you just use Magick to fight your flab, Mab?"" I hear the cynics sneer! Well, I've always thought that Witchcraft is about knowing WHEN to use magick & when NOT to. The thing about Magick is that it follows the path of least resistance, so if you're not willing to put in the work, you'll get nowhere very fast! So, I'll go to the gym &amp; work my butt off & maybe part way through, when I'm getting bored & sick of it, I'll do a little something to strengthen my resolve & give my willpower an extra boost - THAT'S the most effective way to do it (from my own past experience, that is!). Plus, this way I get to buy myself a new swimming costume & a cute little work-out outfit too - LOL!  I'm going to ask Karl about doing a session on the new site tomorrow night too. I'd like to see how we're progressing & get an estimate on when things should be ready to test out. Reckon Esk will want to come round for that too - we're both just so excited about the whole project!  Then on Sunday, I think I shall have a rest - kick back & watch a movie on our new wide-screen TV & shiny new DVD player with Dale, & generally do nothing much at all. I reckon I deserve a rest after the week I've had!  Another thing today was the discussion over at Lone Witch about it being Friday 13th - we're any of us superstitious about it or did we feel more unlucky on that day? The resounding answer, overall, was a big ""NO!"". Personally, I've always rather LIKED Friday 13th! I've always been rather fond of the number 13 anyway & Friday is practically the weekend, so what's NOT to like? So, I've never felt more unlucky on Friday 13th than any other day - I see no reason for it.  And I'm not afraid to walk under ladders either - LOL!",female,27,indUnk,Libra,1
3220,4088894,2004-08-06,"So, Esk came round this evening & we discussed our plans for the new Lone Witch site with my hubby & bruv-in-law, just throwing around our options on how to include everything we want to be part of the new site. Ended up with both of them saying they'd have a go to see what they could come up with, so we'll have a choice to look at - hurrah!  It's all getting rather exciting now, knowing that pretty soon we'll have a site to call our own. Of course, all this means that we will effectively be going ""back to school"" to learn how to maintain the site & sort out all those little problems that are bound to crop up. Really, it's going to have to be the simplest possible format as we're both complete thickies when it comes to the net (kind of strange that 2 such techno-inepts should decide to build their own site!).  Anyway, after being friends for 15 years now, Esk & I are discovering that we really DO think alike & are coming up with the same ideas at the same time & kind of freaking out the boys a little by completing each other's sentences & speaking at the same time. Well, after that amount of time in each other's company, I suppose this kind of thing has to be expected really. We've started looking at styles of layouts & ideas for artwork now - by the time we're done, this site is going to be HUGE!!!  Better think about getting some sleep as tomorrow will be a very busy day in Aberdeen - the International Children's Festival is on, it's Tartan Day, the International Market will be there, the circus is in town along with the God Squad down at the beach. And Esk & I are also going on one of the Haunted Aberdeen tours tomorrow afternoon, so all in all, a pretty packed day full stop!",female,27,indUnk,Libra,1
3221,4088894,2004-08-03,"Well, I've registered a domain name for Lone Witch & building of the site will commence as of tonight!  Esk & I have wanted to do this for quite some time, but now that the domain name is registered, it feels a lot more 'real' - like it's actually going to happen at long last.  No longer will be have to put up with the finicky Ya-hell!  We'll be setting up forums, files, calander, database, etc, & it will be all-singing, all-dancing!  A whole new beginning for the Lone Witch Group - we'll be able to expand & do anything we please with it.  I'm so excited I've practically been jumping up & down non-stop since last night!  It'll be a hard slog, but worth it in the long run, I reckon...",female,27,indUnk,Libra,1
3222,4088894,2004-08-03,"Well, after a lovely weekend celebrating so much, here I am, back at my computer once more. The Lammas/Mabon issue of Dragonswood magazine is now on the shelves in our local Pagan shop (I've had to buy a spare copy to send to my mother as my 1st column appears in it &, to my delight & surprise, is credited on the front cover!). So, now I have to begin work on the NEXT column in time for the Samhain/Yule issue. Well, I say 'being', it just needs proof reading & tightening up a bit & it's good to go!  I've updated the Lone Witch sister site  urlLink http://www.lonewitch.blinks.net/  & also my own personal site  urlLink http://www.mabon-online.blinks.net/  ready for Mabon which is the next holiday on the Wheel of the Year, & now I must get cracking on the Mabon issue of Triptych so I can get it on the shelves at Kabbalah in plenty of time.  Kabbalah is our local Pagan shop, run by Elaine & has many wondrous goodies for the discerning Witch in Aberdeen. Actually, its the only shop of its type in the city at the moment & it has everything from herbs & incense to books & altar tools. Not only that, but the staff are wonderful too - always ready for a friendly chat on any subject under the sun. I remember interviewing Elaine for an early issue of Triptych (back when it didn't have a name & was just the Lone Witch Newsletter) & she said she didn't think they'd do an online shop at all, but now, things have changed, & she has a lovely little site for ordering all the things you might want online:  urlLink http://www.kabbalahshop.co.uk/   Lastly of all, I have prepared for the coming Sabbat (which is my namesake) by creating a whole new look for myself. Gone are the long blonde locks - replaced by a short, choppy crop with which I am delighted. So, now that my head is no longer bogged down by the weight of all that hair, perhaps I shall be inspired to write something really special for Triptych!",female,27,indUnk,Libra,1
8926,3673762,2004-06-25,"I brought them both home with me this evening. (Technically last night, since it is now well past midnight.)  Pippi was waiting for me in the children's section of my local Big Chain bookstore. I had sat at the kiddie table to flip through Ed Emberley's drawing books. Pippi caught my eye from a discarded stack of books across the table, when I paused to sip my Starbucks coffee. I loved her when I was a kid, and my hand automatically reached out for her cheery face on the book's cover.  I had forgotten she is the strongest girl in the world, has her own house, and is an orphan. Just like ME! I'm tempted to dye my (graying) hair red, but I'll compromise by wearing pig tails now and then.  Pippi had me reminiscing past joys, so I sprung for a compilation CD of Kitaro's music from the 70s and 80s. I've lusted for that album since a boyfriend played the cassette version in his truck for me, at his farm in Grand Forks, North Dakota, in 1988. We discussed romance to Kitaro's pulsing accompaniment. The music stayed with me, the boyfriend didn't, thank goodness.  Better go beddie-bye before I spill too much information here.

8927,3673762,2004-06-23,"With the death of my brother last month, I have no immediate family. I had been trying to call him, to wish him Happy Easter and Birthday in April, then to see how he was in May. I kept leaving messages.  Not until that day in May that a nurse called to tell me he had died a few hours earlier, did I know he had moved twice this year. I try not to be angry...""If only someone had called me back to let me know he had moved, I could have talked to him one last time...."" I immediately got on a plane and flew to where he was. I buried him near my parents. Thatâs about all I have the emotional stamina to say about it tonight.  With his death all my immediate family are gone.  So for a while I holed up. I read, wrote, and wallowed. It makes no sense to me that I should be w/o family at such a young age. I've done everything right as a loyal and compassionte being, and it's no joke that most people who meet me like me. I like people too, hence my profile, ""loner who likes people."" (More on that in a future post.)  And as I've learned well, each time there is death near me, a friend or two or three, will drop from the radar. I've had enough practice not to take this personally. Meanwhile, others have stepped forward in unexpected support and generosity. The last two afternoons I was treated to coffee and chat by new acquaintances. I doubt these will become serious friendships, but I am glad to learn once again that when some fall away, either in death or because they don't want to be around a person who is hurting, there are many angels willing to step in.  I almost gave up again. I decided to become a hermit, far beyond my usual loner self. Yet that pebble of courage that always grinds into my heel when I take a step kept prodding me. For a week, at least, I'm trying to play in the friendship game again.  A funny part of my coffee dates with these two women was that I listened to them talk about their love lives. Hearing their joys and sorrows, and offering ideas as asked, made me feel alive and hopeful; for love, even lost love, is the breath of life. We talked little of my situation. For me, that was a relief; a mental vacation. I told them so.  My life is changing. I have always been a loner. I want to be different than I've been in that regard, but I think the programming is hard wired. I prefer it.  This book perks me up when I start telling people off in my mind for what my emotional center registers as abandonment:  Anyway: The Paradoxical Commandments:  Finding Personal Meaning in a Crazy World   by Kent M. Keith  People will leave in various ways. I'm a true friend anyway. Others stay, and love me no matter how life turns. I am grateful.",female,47,Arts,Virgo,1

Why do I have to be an orphan at such a young age?"" There's no answer.     So I'll follow your advice, and continue to live the happiest life I know how.

The Oscar-winning film, released last year, was based on the true story of Aileen Wuornos, a serial killer in Florida in the 80s and 90s.  What does this have to do with Google? Photos of Aileen. Her famous, chilling, brown-eyed stare was captured by actor Charlize Theron in the movie, and it was  scary . Wanting to know if the effect was movie magic, or real life, I looked up Wuornos on Google.  After reading several articles on her, I clicked the Images feature just above the search text. Let me tell you, I was not disappointed. Take a look:  urlLink   Brown Eyes      See Rome and Die  Who said that? Iâll have to search later. But Aileen inspired me to remember the quote.

I told my friend, âNo way, there are laws and agenciesâ¦.â He explained a friend of his who was terminally ill paid in advance for it all, and it was âdirt cheapâ (pardon pun) to the tune of $600 USD, including picking up the body. As Iâd just paid thousands, I found the idea appealing. Iâll leave it to you to search for that one, and I donât recommend looking for images. Unless they are of âHappy Acresâ.

Secondly, I've quite possibly had the best week ever.    As of last Sunday, my mom and I have been house sitting at her bosse's house due to the fact that they're in Utah for a softball tournament, and the two dogs that they have need to be taken care of.  I figured this would be a good time to invite Allie over, since I hadn't seen her in the first two weeks she was in AZ because I'm an idiot.  Here's the basic run down of week:    Monday - Nothing too interesting.  The oh-so original sit on your ass and do nothing day.    Tuesday - First day with Allie.  We went out to an Italian resturant (the name of which escapes me at the moment) first, and then headed out to AZ Mills, where we spent about two hours, despite the fact that we only went into two stores.    Wednesday - Movie night.  We rented Butterfly Effect, which was suprisingly good.  Since when could Kutcher act?  After the movie, Allie and I sat and talked for two-ish hours.  Needless to say, that was much fun.    Thursday/Friday - See Monday.    Today - Woke up, walked the dogs, and then got ready for a whole day with Allie.  Picked her up around eleven, and then went out for breakfast at Dennies.  Afterwards, we went to the mall again.  However, this time we went to Superstition Springs instead of AZ Mills.  I think she was mad at me for a bit when I bought her a book she wanted, even though she had the money to pay for it, though.  I do what I can.  We had planned on going to Polar Ice; but with Dennies and the mall, there was no time to get there for public skating.  Instead, we came back to the house and swam for bit.  Then I got to spend some quality time with my one and only until she had to leave.    Now I have to wait until Wednesday to see her again, and she leaves on Thursday... I really don't know what I'm going to do without her.  There'll be next summer, though.  I'll be heading out to Europe with Allie, my 8th grade social studies teacher, and a group of some other kids that I don't know for three weeks.  That's still a long way away, though.

19894,3016686,2004-03-31,"Everybody knows that I love pop music and treat it with the same passion and critical ear that I would any other type of music.    Janet Jackson has always been a really solid pop artist. Her CDs between 1986 and 1993 were  perfect . Now, post  nipplegate ,  when Janet should be seeking to regain credibility (malfunction, my ass!), she releases the turd that is ""Damita Jo."" Poor J-Ho seems to have fallen victim to the same Diva Curse that afflicted Madonna, Mary J. Blige and many others recently. This CD is a bunch of underbaked midtempos and finger-snap-beat sex ballads that sound like rejects from her '93 ""Janet"" CD.   Her usual lame-o interludes are here too: last time it was between-take Fran Drescher imitations and this time it's faux interviews about her history. A last-minute attempt to string this record into some kind of autobiographical narrative?   This would be fine if you were a HOOKER and your life revolved around giving head in parked cars.  How many Janet tracks do we need that give her explicit instructions on oral love? Especially if said ""head"" belongs to jheri-curled midget maestro Jermaine Dupree?  Blech.    Is this all she has to say at 37 years old?  Come back to the rhythm nation, Janet Jackson, Janet Jackson!    The single ""I Want You"" is somewhat of an Alicia Keys ripoff, but it does have a sort of lush, carefree sweetness. I particularly like the ""have your way with me"" bridge, which is a tasty come-on, but not dirrrty.  There are maybe 4 other tracks worthy of Janet and the rest is craven drivel.

19897,3016686,2004-03-27,"I am afraid to say that ""Patience"" requires some. It's in sore need of editing. Like most CDs now, it's too long - there are 14 or 15 songs and most are about 6 minutes long.   ""Patience"" sounds like the studio creation of a man who has not set foot outside his house in the past 5 or 6 years (apparently too busy rolling doobies).  It has a very airless, studio-sealed quality.  The arrangements don't  breathe  the way they did on ""Listen Without Prejudice.""  They are  grooves  more than  songs .  Havng said that, he adds several songs to his ""canon"" (!):  ""Amazing"" is  not , but it's better than Madonna's song of the same name. It's a sweet, midtempo pop love song that would sound great on radio, if they'd ever play it. ""Precious Box"" is one of the best songs GM has ever written - a bit of social commentary about pop culture / media in the new century.  It would have sounded truly contemporary in  2001 , but it's still propulsive and hooky. Great for night driving.  ""My Mother Had A Brother"" is a sad song about George's gay uncle killing himself the day George was born.  It's really personal - a message to his dead mother and uncle. It's also one of his finest ballads. The whole record seems very personal:  there are happy memories of his Wham! days (""Round Here"") and learn-from-me warnings to a younger generation about self-respect (the excellent ""Cars And Trains"").  Worst song:  Aside from the previously released craptastic ""Freek 04"" (which sounds just like ""Freeek"" which should have been called ""Freeek93""it's so clunkily dated) , the worst song is ""American Angel"" - the gayest song ever recorded.  It's for George's Texan boyfriend and it features gushingly bad lines like this:    Through all of those battles then you came Stepped out of the fading light Said, âBaby I'm American, dry your eyes again, Because I'm here to save your lifeâ   Thank you, Lord God King Bufu. I wish I could say I loved this CD. GM's voice sounds terrific, but most of the songs are just a little bit dated, without being classic. In fact they're bloated, like GM's tummy.

It's unexpected too - the previously obtuse  John Frusciante  (of Red Hot Chili Peppers / toothless addict fame) has released a beautiful new CD called ""Shadows Collide With People""   Seems like he's taken quite a leap with this record.  According to Lisa, his last solo records were unlistenable noise / noodlings. This one is chock full of strong melodies, Cali alt-pop-rock arrangements and surprisingly good singing.  It's a wee bit too long- 19 tracks, including some instrumentals, that could have been cut by about 4.  The details are there too: the sparing use of vocoder on ""The Slaughter"" intro, the strong vocals on ""Carvel"" and the lovely eat-your-heart-out-Richard-Ashcroft lyrics / music of ""Ricky."" The sound of the CD is reminiscent of the very good 2002 RHCP record ""By The Way"" - minus their lingering funk and occasionally irritating Anthony Keidis raps.

I had never heard of him until that movie, so I guess Pedro's idea worked.  He's a Brazilian singer who has been a beloved star for about 35 years.    This week he released an English language CD called ""A Foreign Sound."" It intrigued me because of its various covers:  Nirvana's ""Come As You Are,"" Talking Heads ""Nothing But Flowers"" mixed with ""Cry Me A River"" and Cole Porter's ""So In Love,"" among others.  One song that works well for me is the schmaltzy 70's hit ""Feelings"" - once done to great effect by Lindsey Wagner on the Bionic Woman.  (Jamie Summers went uncercover in a beauty pageant and this song was her talent act, but I digress...)  Caetano's voice is perfect for this song because he never allows it to go over the top. It's actually subtle. Less successful is his version of one of my favorite songs, ""Nature Boy.""

I don't usually  speak  to famous people when I see them, though I do tend to look them in the eye. But I always said that if I ever met Michele Martin of ABC News (""This Week"") and PBS (""Washington Week""), that I would tell her what a  right-on  woman I think she is. I had a whole 30-second speech planned out.   Yesterday, June 17, on my way home, my moment arrived. The lovely Michele Martin was getting into a cab near the ABC studios off of Conn Ave and was talking to 2 teenage girls standing about 10 feet away from her. Not sure who they were, but I don't think they were her kids (she just had a baby). I tried  ever so  to be polite and not interrupt, so I slowed way down, waiting for my window of opportunity. When it became clear they weren't going to stop talking, I went for broke. Standing in the middle of the street between Filene's and The Mayflower I rooted myself into the cement, pointed at her (which caught her eye) and screamed  I love you - you ROCK!  (emphasis on rock). She was about 20 feet away and looked at me and yelled back -not missing a beat-  ""Thank  you, but don't tell me, tell them!"" nodding to the girls. I have no idea who they were, but the girls didn't see me and I just kept going.  It was not your usual DC encounter, but I think I made my point, albeit looking like a slightly crazed fan in the process.

19935,3016686,2004-06-11,"So I have just come from seeing  urlLink Madonnaâs show  where we were a part of what she called the best crowd of the tour so far. Sadly, we had CRAP seats up high on the side of the stage, so I missed much of the show as it was intended to be seen. We were the mizzies up there - les miserables â who got half a show. Missed the  urlLink whole opening segment . Thank God for the video screen.  My favorites: ""Vogue"" was the opener, a Dangerous Liaisons version with impossible looking  urlLink yoga poses . Very  urlLink bendy ! Her  urlLink costume  was great (Lacroix sweetie?) and she looked really beautiful on the screen. Not sure about up close!   ""Mother and Father"" is an 80's electroclash song on the new record, but itâs turned into a big mid-tempo centerpiece in this show. Great singing on this one, despite the fact she didnât cut the ridiculous rap bit, which includes such genius rhymes as: ""My father had to go to work / I used to think he was a jerk.""   ""Crazy For Youâ was one of the most emotional songs, at least for anyone who is old enough to remember when that song came out. She was  urlLink alone  a lot more on the stage this tour, perhaps b/c she is damn old and cannot do the constant dancing. The result was more of a connection with the audience. I suppose âImagineâ (yes, that one) was supposed to be the emotional centerpiece, but - as always - the gears do show.  People admire Madonna's work ethic because you can SEE it - see her working. Thatâs not really the way it should be, but it's part of her charm.  On ""Imagine"" she did a good job, but she was trying too hard and the song lost something for me (aside from the fact it's just an overheard song).  âCrazy For Youâ was more about her singing to the audience without appearing to think about it so much.  GREAT version of  â urlLink American Life ,â a song I dislike. Very heavy metal, but we werenât able to really get the full effect of the visuals from our seats. It was silly and serious at the same time.    Not so great: I totally disliked the whole  urlLink circus part  of the show, which was Vegas kitschy and too Janet Jackson for my taste. She did the AWFUL âHanky Pankyâ and a strange, jazzy version of ""Deeper And Deeper"" The oddest part here was how she performed âDie Another Dayâ in this circus costume - didnât work.    The  urlLink finale  was ""Music:"" and ""Holiday"" with both changed a little bit, but neither quite as the Drowned World Tour versions.  Why do the same finale on this tour?   Fave dance moves: one of the songs had a momentary tango with Madonna and 5 men, but they were all attached: she danced with one and the others gripped each other's arms. It probably looked strange at eye level, but was really clever form the nosebleeds (ah-ha!).  âPapa Donât Preachâ had a sort of ring-around-the-rosie bit that finished the song with them holding hands and spinning as the lights went down. V good.  The dancers in this show are athletes who have to do amazing feats: scary extreme skateboarding, drum'n'bugle-esque gun twirling, breakdancing, dancing with  urlLink sticks , scary trapeze work.   On ""Into The Groove"" they had the num chuck things but nobody knocked out their own teeth. How they live through each night I don't know.  From our seats we could also see that the floor was constantly opening and sinking and rising, which must be another hazard.  An onstage conveyor belt made for some cool moves (borrowed from her '87 tour) and the  urlLink bagpiperâs  dancing was a surprise.   On her last tour, my favorite song was La Isla Bonita because a) it was an oldie and b) it was sweet and she seemed to be enjoying herself.  This WHOLE show is like that.

When you find a singer as good as kd, you need to also find songs worthy of her voice. She does that consistently on this album ( urlLink samples here ).  kd's Joni Mitchell covers here are very faithful. On ""Jericho,"" a song about maintaining a relationship, kd sounds as if she'd stepped into the 1970's to use Joni's arranger.

It's true that kd emphasizes the pop in folk/pop, but on Jane's record ""The Valley"" is a bit meandering and her it is concise. The hook is elegant because it's used so sparingly in both versions. ""Love Is Everything"" is just a  majestic  breakup song - I don't quite like the way kd changes the words in the bridge (see lyric booklet and compare), but her voice was made to belt this song.

Damon Gough's songs wind around like a slow, drunken drivers who have no home or destination. Perhaps the genius  About A Boy  soundtrack ( AAB ) succeeded because he had such a specific assignment?  Write about A, B and C and intersperse it with sweet little instrumentals.       urlLink ""Easy Love""  sounds like it could have been on  AAB  - it's plaintive and honest. Likewise,  urlLink ""The Year Of The Rat""  is a worthy first single. It' s classic BDB. He even manages to pull off a children's choir, which usually makes a song sound cloying. In this case, the kiddies sibilant ""everybody needsh to know itsh the year of the rat"" is endearing.

Sex and violence are two completely different things and should not be mixed unless it's agreed upon by two adults prior to jumping into (or being pushed onto) the bed.

Mom was thrilled and loved her and had me do a lot of free cat sitting when she was out of town. Well, mom's bf didn't like the cat and mom decided she didn't want it anymore so instead of working to get it a new home, she dumped it at the Animal Shelter where it will probably be put down or traumatized further for being abandoned. It makes me so mad.  You know, mankind domesticated an animal, there was an implicit promise that we would take care of the animal as we made it impossible for that species to take care of itself sufficiently, especially after we declaw (or whatever) the poor thing. For me, a pet is like a member of the family. God, you know, it makes me wonder if I had been a willful child if she woulda dumped me off somewhere.

BTW, here is something interesting I've read...Hope you like it too:   ""The seasons, in fact, teach us two lessons that both steady and chastise: all things must pass, and all things shall return. They tell us that every new beginning brings us closer to an end, and every elegy has withing it the echo (and the promise) of a future celebration. They say that love that seems eternal now may soon be a distant memory; and that a new love may come along to revive our sense of eternity. They teach us that suffering is inevitable, and in that inevitability is a constancy that helps take the edge off suffering. We cherish flowers more than evergreens, precisely because they do not last.   Season instruct us, then. In a subtler way of being; they initiate us into a process more universal than the New Year and more flexible than moons. All of us have our own calendars, and all of us think in terms of spring cleaning or fall fashions, But seasons induct us into a world of divisions that are never hard and fast (soft and slow, rather); they offer lessons about constancy and flux, and show us that there are some things- for all our fears of global warming and a nuclear winter- we cannot much affect. Seasons teach us about transitions, for winter elides into spring as gently as remorse into regret, or adolescence into youth. And just when we assume that winter is gone, an unseasonable blizzard will come down to remind us we were wrong.""  There, that's it. Quite a long piece. Those Lit pupils should be able to understand it better, I suppose.

As far as the eye can tell, there was nothing wrong with the ship. The cargo, supplies, and personal belongings were still on the Marie Celeste. Evidence aboard showed that the Marie Celeste had clearly been abandoned quickly.

You see, it is 10:30 now and in a half an hour, I would be lying soundly in my bed, dreaming whatever it is that I would be dreaming. lolz.  First of all, my little sister enter this National Story Telling Competition, and for some strange reason, actually came in first. After think about this unlikely incident, I have come to a few conclusions: 1)Her school bribed the judges. 2)There was a mixup in the prize department and the top prize was given to them by mistake. 3)She really was that good. O.o Go on, take a wild guess as to which is the correct reason. :P In all likelihood, you would be able to read about her in the newspapers in the days to come, so do keep an eye out. :D  Aww, darn! I'm almost out of time! So here is a quick quote, this time taken from Scott Adams, the author of Dilbert.  "" I don't know why everyone says poverty can't be eliminated. The solution is obvious to me. All it takes is what bankers call the :""miracle of compound interest."" This requires a long-term approach to the problem, but its fairly foolproof if you're patient. All you do is give each poor person a dollar. There are only about 5 billion poor people, so this is quite affordable as a percentage of the worldwide GNP. That dollar is deposited in a special bank account for each of the poor people with the idea that it stays there for generations collection interest. The number of poor people doubles every twenty years, but the value of money doubles every ten years, assuming it is well invested, so the gap will close. In 4000 years, the descendants of the poor people will be allowed to go to the bank and asked for their money. The bank will inform them that the dollar was taken in fees 4000 years ago, and the balance of all their accounts is zero. At this point, the poor people will kill the bankers and steal all the money in the bank, thus ending poverty completely.""  -Scott Adams, The Dilbert Future.  Okay, its now 11.

A most unexpected person came along too - Renee! I was really surprised that she was there. Anyway, back to the show. ""The Spook Show"" isn't bad to watch...The tricks the magician made were quite predictable, but nonetheless entertaining. There is, of course, always a trick involved, but yet we humans still watch a ""magic"" show to see a trick done well. It is just one of those things that humans do...Even if you have seen lots of magic shows and are able to tell what the next trick's going to be just by looking at the props on stage. :P  After watching the show, I went back home to sleep. Well, duh. Did you expect me to sleep in the streets? Ha.  Well, today we had our mork test on Social Studies and History. I hope that I would do well...I really do...It will show just how good I am....Or how bad I am, depending on how you look at it. lolz.

If you've watched the live telecast of the whole event, I suppose that you would have noticed that Mr. Lee was extremely nervous when he beening sworn in...So nervous that he placed his hand down before it was done! I imagine that he must be so embarrassed! lolz. But, when he came up to deliver his speech, he did it with such grace and tact that even I would be hard-pressed to outdo him....Why are you looking at me like that?

Really a nice show...The begining is a little boring, but it gets better as it progresses. Long live Gundam Seed!!!  Ahhh, didn't do much today...Spent the whole day watching Gundam Seed. The are a few loopholes though. For example, when the Aegis Gundam attached itself to Strike and blew itself up, how did Kira get to Lucas's house at PLANT? And the ArchAngel...It was able to defend itself so well in the begining of the series...Then, after it was repaired at Orb, its hull could be torn apart by a single missile. lolz.

Alvin Inc. apologies for any inconvenience caused by this lapse in duty. :P  Right! Yesterday, my school celebrated National Day. Mostly what we did was watch the uniformed groups march into the quadrangle, after which we sang the National Anthem. Then the uniformed groups marched off, after which the Girls Brigade performed a complicated drill. They pulled it off quite well, though a few missteps did pop up here and there. I suppose that this is to be expected. After all, they are only human. :P  Now take a wild guess as to what happened next. Yup! Got it in one. We started singing the national day songs. Every year it is the same old story. Every year we do the same thing on National Day. Wonât it ever change? Oh botherâ¦. Anyway, we had our Thanksgiving Festival today. All in all, its not badâ¦Though it got quite boring in parts.  :D The band played really well, in my option.  Shuyi did a great job singing in the choir. I canât even begin to imagine the amount of guts it took for her to stand there and sing like it is nobodyâs business. Nicely done, Shuyi!  Haiz, next week we would be having another mock test...This time it is Social Studies and History...Again! Apparently, the school feels that we aren't good enough at our combined humanities, so they are trying to give us lots of practice before the Prelims and the Os. Haiz...  Another thing I've noticed...Why do we always say ""The school"" this and ""The school"" that when what we really want to say is that the people in charge of the school is the ones who came up with the decision. The school is just a building, a pile of bricks and mortar all placed in a fashion which would allow it to support the weight of all the students. It is not a sentential being. It does not think. So why do we always say that it is the school which came up with the decision? Even I am guilty of doing this. I don't know...I suppose that it is just one of those things.  Okay here is the quote of the day:  In fact, the mere act of opening the box will determine the state of the cat, although in this case there were three determinate states the cat could be in: these being Alive, Dead, and Bloody Furious. -- Schrodinger's Moggy explained (Terry Pratchett, Lords and Ladies)  Ah, too bored liao.

47558,743739,2004-07-11,"QUICK, click  urlLink HERE     Ok, with that out of the way, let me tell you about last week. Last week I had the privilege of attending Falls Creek with Glenstone Baptist Church. This was I believe my 9th year at Falls Creek, being a sponsor for six of those. Although I am cheating on one of the years, I only spent a day and a half at FC last year and I was probably technically a guest, but in my eyes I am always in charge so who cares.   Hey, back to what is important. We had 3 salvations last week, which was awesome, and if any of those three are reading this, I want you to know I am proud of you and praying that you continue to grow in your relationship with Jesus. We also had a student commit her life to ministry. To this student all I can say is I know what lies ahead for you, and I am sorry.  For those of you who can't tell, I'm kidding. When called to it, there is nothing better than full time ministry.    In addition, I grew personally in my walk with God. Last week was a time of teaching for me, I taught the morning in cabin studies, and a time of prayer. While it was great to be teaching again, most of my growth came in the area of prayer. For many of us prayer is something that we do because we are supposed to, and then we sit back and hope God answers it. However I got to experience prayer as an exciting thing, and I got to see very quick results from it. Nothing is as exciting as knowing that you prayed for something one night, and then seeing it happen the next day.   Well it's time to pack for camp this week, we leave early tomorrow. For those of you who went to camp with me last week, feel free to post a comment below, I promise Asa dosn't bite.....often. You can just say hi, or even share your experiences from camp if you wish. Also, in addition to commenting, be in prayer for me and my church during the next week. Specifically pray that we see God's power in the area of salvations, just like we did last week.   Until I get back next week remember, same bat time, same bat channel.   Yeah, I had to do that",male,24,Student,Sagittarius,0

47566,743739,2004-08-02,"So let me see how much of my trip I remember; at the same time recording it for future generations.   Thursday (July 22)  All day spent traveling.  We ended up in Flagstaff AZ, the most expensive hotel city in American.  Ok, probably not, but when did the truth matter here?  Friday  Hey look, another driving day, but this time with flair.  After buying cheap gas in Kingman AZ, we headed north to see Hoover Dam.  This was also our first time to drive through a security checkpoint.  Apparently we didn't look like we intended to blow up the dam, and was allowed to drive across.  This was also the day to see Death Valley.  All I can say is appropriate name. Hey, did you know there are no roads going across central California?  Not even minor ones like we guessed there had to be.  So, we got to go north all the way past Yosemite and take a road that looks nice and straight on the map.  On the map.  Stupid map.  So its 11 pm and we are winding through curves going up and down mountains amazed that we haven't passed a town with a gas station in a long time.  a long time.  And yes, for those of you who can guess where this is leading, I can now say that I have been stranded for 2+ hours in a national forest in California.  Special thanks to Daniel Lions for helping us out there.  Saturday Ok, so really that last think carried over into Saturday and we got to Oakland at 9 in the morning.  The baseball game was an afternoon game so we took a short nap and then proceeded to Network Associates Coliseum.  Yes, the stadium is as awful as you have heard.  However it was nice to see other A's fans.  Also it was a 6-2 Oakland win, with Kotsey hitting 2 home runs and Dotel pitching the ninth (three straight strike outs).  More importantly, I am now a 1989 World Series Champion and I have the ring to prove it.  Take that, San Fran Giants.  Oh, also I burnt my head during this game.  Not Fun.  Sunday Church at Harvest something in Fremont CA.  Good praise and worship.  The pastor delivered a good message, but is younger and still needs some polish.  All and All a great experience. After church we headed over to Fishermens wharf.  Pier 39 I believe.  Let me tell you, I have never seen so many shops crammed into such a small space and the crab was amazing.  Yes those of you that I talk to often will hear about the crab, then hear about the crab, and possibly hear about the crab some more.  OH, I almost forgot.  We took the Bay Bridge to get to San Fran (where the wharf is).  Awesome experience, out of the three bay bridges we took, this was my favorite.  Of course I am bias by memories of the quake hitting this bridge during the 1989 World Series (which I won). After fishermen's wharf, we drove over the Golden Gate Bridge.  This was nice, but the fog was heavy.  This kinda made it cool, but also made it impossible to see the top of the cables supporting the bridge. Heading north, we crossed back over the third northern bridge that I can't remember the name of.  Awesome.  This bridge was huge.  Yeah, thats all I'm going to say.  Monday If I was as cool as Willie Nelson, I would sing about being on the road again.  Instead I will just relate that we drove through Sequoia National Park, giant trees and nice mountains, on the way to Phoenix.  Another late night as we arrived at the hotel at 3am, I believe.  Tuesday Tuesday I slept.  Oh yeah and ate TCBY yogurt, losing that was the worst thing that ever happened to Stillwater.  Wednesday Umm yeah, more sleeping and TCBY that night.   Thursday Ill let you use your imagination, and yes, more TCBY.  Friday Mexico Day.  Yes, a quick jaunt into Mexico.  Also we saw the cacti at Saguaro National Park.  And driving, ended the day in Las Cruces New Mexico.  Saturday So driving through NM is boring.  The day ended in Amarillo Tx.  Some good bar b q and TCBY led us into bed time.  Oh yes, also I got to listen to the A's beating the rangers on rangers radio, that was fun.  Sunday Trinity Fellowship Church in Amarillo.  Rodger Hodges church, and if you don't know who Rodger Hodges, shame on you.  BTW Martin, he is the worship leader there.  So of course great praise and worship, Good message, then a 5 hour drive home.   So all in all it was a great trip.  Phoenix was a disappointment, my only plans were to see Bill Heaton, a local youth minister I once worked for, but our schedules never worked out for that to happen.  I must say it is great to be back home.  Even though the month started with two youth camps, only one was with ""MY"" group =), so I'm starting to feel separated from them (not necessarily saying that is bad).

68200,4198746,2004-08-12,"For many of us, who live in Louisiana, tomorrow is the first day of school. The first day of a fresh start to prove to everyone, our teachers, parents, and fellow friends, how intelligent we are. Many people look forward to this day, to see friends again or to show off their new clothes, shoes, etc. I, however, view it as just another day at school. There's nothing really special about it. What does this day have over any other day of the school year? I say there are only three instances where the day is different: 1. any day before a holiday 2. the last day of school 3. the day of an exam or report card. Why would anyone think the first day of school as an exciting day. It signals the start of going back to school for 180, or less, days. To me the first day of school is just like a Monday. Luckily, this is my last year. Hope all of you have a great year in high school or college.",male,17,Student,Aries,0

I will never play no chip value poker. I don't see what's the point of not making the chips worth something. If you can't tell my by now, I lost. I guess it's the fact that I, at first, have the better hand then everyone else gets lucky and ends up beating me. To cap off the night it's raining. What a great fucking day.

105336,3670229,2004-06-28,"Ok, I'm gonna write this one in english, just in case a fellow American comes here.  I have seen the last movie of Michael Moore yesterday but before commenting directly on that I would like to talk about a converstation I had Saturday night with some American friends. In Seattle, most people I know and see are ""liberals"" and so they definitely want to get rid of Bush in November election. Hence, they were telling me things like ""I don't know if I am gonna see this movie, I know already that Bush is a complete asshole etc..."". I imagine they don't want to hear again about some of the stories the film talks about, like the 2000 election and Bush's ""coup"". And they said they don't think this movie was going to change anything on the way people are going to vote in November.  Then, I came to see that movie the day after (yesterday), and I must say I don't think they were right about the movie. I think it can definitely change the way one sees Bush, and the American political system as a whole, also. I was really hurt by that movie, and I am not a particularly sensible person. I already knew of many facts the movie talks about (like the Carlyle group or BinLaden's and Bush's families relationships). I had seen, when I was still in France, a documentary on that, which was more documented and precise than Moore's movie but much colder and far less moving. But Farenheit 9/11 is not only about facts, even if it states the most brutal ones, it is about men in war, men that decide of wars, and men that actually do war, basically the young and poor unemployed people of the United-States.  It reminds me of this Bob Dylan song ( urlLink Masters of War ), which seems to be fairly naive when you listen to the lyrics. Go and see Moore's movie, and you will find those lyrics are far from naive ...  Finally, before seeing that movie, I did not understand why it has won the ""Palme d'Or"" at last Cannes Festival, now that I've seen it, I definitely understand the decision of the jury. When a film can move you as this one has moved me, it deserves that kind of prizes and that many many people go and see it.",male,26,Science,Leo,0

106583,3900039,2004-07-24,"So today Courtney and I went to Collin's house to swim. I got there first so I just let myself in and everything 'cause I assumed he still was out of town. But I noticed shoes and a pillow and some odd placed things....so I kept calling him and there was no answer, so I went downstairs to his room and there was the boy and his dog fast asleep. It was one of the all time cutest things I've ever seen. He woke up shortly and I switched his laundry for him. Court and I swam and when we came back in Quentin had arrived. Then Court and I went to get ice cream(and to see Bryan oh so cute). Christina showed up at Collin's while we were gone and called to ask for ice cream too and it was a bad mess....we had so much ice cream all over the car, just a huge sticky melting mess, and then we didn't get Quentin any and I was afraid he would be upset, but he seemed fine(we are on good terms, I'm glad). Kaitlin also came over and Collin had a mini-reunion with all us. Then I sent him back off on his way to Portland with Mindy to catch a flight to Colorado for a family reunion. I seriously haven't seen him hardly at all, but he will be back for good in a week. Thank goodness... I'm having major Collin withdrawls....which is probably why I'm at his house with out him and we will prolly have a party here tonight. well not a party...more like a get together with the gang to swim and have a fire haha!

106587,3900039,2004-07-18,"Carol put a song on her blog about missing people who are no longer in your life. I recently had a conversation with someone I had not talked to in a long time and it made me realize how much I truly miss him, and missed missing him. So this is a sorry to him and the others that have somehow over time become to be a past and not a present part of my life...   Scott:  Thank you so much for caring about me and praying for me when we were younger. Tears come to my eyes just remembering the times in my life when you would pray for me and bring hope back into my eyes. You are an amazing person in every way and I hope your future remains as bright as you make it out to be. You are so optimistic and I love that about you. You have not changed in the year that we havent had an indepth conversation, and I hope you never do. I wish you luck on your wish to become a pastor; you would make a great one, and I would know as you were my own little pastor(Jeremiah 29:11, I still have it memorized). I am so sorry that high school and my own self conciousness and busyness has drawn us apart from eachother. I really wish things had worked out differently. You will always be special to me.   Ryan:  Although I have already repaired our friendship and been forgiven for the time I did ignore you and let what other people think get in the way of us, I want to say sorry again. There was a whole two years between our strong friendship and I want you to know that I feel very badly  for making you 'non-existant' during that time and I never will try to rid you from my life. It obviously didn't work the first time, so I'm sure there is a reason why you are in my life and I will just sit back and let myself enjoy having such a fun great person in my life. I love you, Ry, and look forward to getting closer to my best friend, if that's even possible.   Tiffani:  We've been through a lot, and I'm glad I had someone there. I know you and I will always be best friends and we will always love eachother, but I also know there are things we just can't change and that there will always be a odd distance between us. I am sorry I could not be there for as much as you needed and I know you tried your hardest. I do not blame you for anything Fani and I love you dearly. Life is already separating us, and I hate it, but I don't know how to stop it. I just pray that we will always know how special our friendship was, and that it's not our faults that things didn't go our way. God has his reasons. I will never forget you.   Baily:  I'm sorry that I never took the time to get to know you, and that i judged you tremendously during the short time I did know you. I am sorry that I have much anger still and no one to take it out on but you. I know I shouldn't blame you but it's difficult not to. I know you would never have intended to hurt anyone you loved, but it is hard to look back at everything Tiff went through and blame no one.   Moyer:  I know we have never talked about it, so I guess I'm just assuming what made us grow apart, but I also know my assumption has a lot to back it up. I am sorry for what I did to you, and I know it was wrong and I regret it more than you can ever understand. I'm sure college also took it's toll on our friendship, but I know that Tyler and I were probably a bigger reason. I was a fool, and I can only look back on it now and apologize to you.   Quentin:  I took a long time, but I am glad both of us have finally grown up and gotten over all the cruel things we did to eachother. There are many things I regret, but many things about our relationship and history that have helped me to grow and mature. I am sorry for the process of doing so. I know things will never be the same and as hard as we try we will never be as close of friends as we once were and that there are many things I did that you were undeserving of, and for that I apologize.   Jacob:  Thank you for everything, including forcing me to realize I could live without you and I didn't need to depend so much on only one person. The end of our friendship made me realize how many more people I had in my life to love. I wish you well in your life. I am trying my hardest to move on and I'm sorry for needing to know more from you than you want to give. I know things will never be the same, and that makes it hard to forgive.   Zach:  I do not know how much I hurt you, or if I even did, but I know some of the things I did to you were wrong and for that I apologize. You hurt me also, but I have moved on, and I hope you have done the same. There was a time in my life that you were important, and I'm sorry that it is no more. Thank you for the fun times we had. I learned alot from our relationship.   Sierra, Autumn, Summer, Jennie, Jamie, Haley:  You are all my most prominent grade school memories. I'm sorry that as we continued with school and grew up we lost contact and our friendships. I wish you all well in life.  Brittany:  I wish I had tried harder to save our friendship back in seventh grade. You were a very important part of my life when I was young and I apologize for throwing that away.   Ricky:  You hurt me tremendously during the short time we were friends, but I want to let you know I have moved on and that I only wish you happiness and hope you are safe and well. I'm sorry that circumstances at the time only made us hurt eachother. I'm sorry that I will regret every memory I have of you for the rest of my life, and I wish I had been strong enough to change that.  Most of these people will never read these, but no one has any clue how much more of a relief it is just to get it out somehow.",female,17,Student,Leo,1
106588,3900039,2004-07-17,"I said I was going to put a picture of my dear friend Carol on here so I might as well write a whole post on her. Carol and I have know eachother a lot longer than we have been friends. Our mom's were teachers at the same school, so we had some contact with eachother. She thought I was a tomboy(cause I was with boys all the time...) and I thought she was a snob. In eighth grade we became friends...I don't know how, lots of mutual friends I guess, and she realized I was just a flirt and not a tomboy, ha.  She is one of the most inspiriational people I have ever met. She has stood as such a great example for me so many times. She has helped me through some of the darkest times in my life, and been there every step of the way, no matter how difficult or stubborn I got, and I can't say that for very many people. I've never found anything to complain about or get annoyed with about Carol, and you have to admit that's rare when it comes to your friends because you are with them so often you have to have the little tiny things that drive you crazy.    I love you Carol, and I know you know that I would do anything and everything possible for you if you ever needed it, but I want to say it anyway. You just flat out are a wonderful amazing human being and I can't begin to express how much I care for you and your wellbeing and happiness. I do not know where I would be with out you. You once had to tell me to hang on and that things would get better because you would make them. At the time all I needed to hear was that. So hang in there, friend, things will get better, and I will make them. I love you.     urlLink",female,17,Student,Leo,1

I want it to stop, but I can't make it. I don't do this, I don't fall in love, especially not when it's impossible, yet I find myself searching for every possible way to talk to him or see him. It's crazy, and it's driving me crazy. I tell myself it won't work and I should give up and stop, but then the what ifs always come back, and he isn't exactly helping my efforts. So far the only red flag is the distance, and I've already made my excuse to ignore that... and for some reason I can't ignore all the reasons in the back of my mind that are making me strongly consider it... I'm crazy... but then something will stand out to me that makes me think I'm not...  A long time ago, my youth pastor taught a lesson on marriage and dating and all that. It was very good and I remember much of it(sadly I didn't think the same at the time). He had us make a list of the qualities we wanted our future spouses to have. Of course some of them were very superficial and immature(as I was in junior high), but most were not. I switched rooms with my parents a while ago and went through tons of old stuff(i'm a keeper..not a throwing away kind of person), and low and behold I found this list... and the part that scares me the most, this person has a lot of the qualities I listed as a naive thirteen year old. Whether that means at thirteen I knew what I wanted or at almost seventeen I'm still imature and materialistic, I do not know, but I hope the former. It just creeps me out... I don't like the idea that I might be becoming a stupid teenage girl who is infatuated to the point she thinks she might actually... I can't even say it... bottom line: I'm crazy.",female,17,Student,Leo,1

To think this time in only a year(which isnt as long as it seems, considering how fast all of high school went) my friends and I will be saying goodbye and living on our own. I might have to actually learn how to fold my own burritos... The other day I lost my license and had to go to the DMV, my most unfavorite place, and get a new one. My parents also mentioned my registration was up. They wrote me a blank check and told me to go, and I started bawling and wanted them to come with me, which is something I never do. I am used to doing things on my own, and generally prefer it. I acted like a baby and refused to go without them holding my hand. I don't want to grow up yet... I love just getting to sleep in when I want and call my friends and go float or randomly go camping. I love being able to spend someone else's money and the biggest consequence be having to return whatever I bought. I love only having to make easy decisions like what I want to wear today or whether I'm going to do my homework or not, not decisions like what bills to pay with this paycheck or which groceries are necessary or how I'm going to pay for college or who I'm going to marry or where I'm going to live. Right now, it feels like my friends are all I have, and I know in a year, I might have to start all over in that department. And it frightens me... As badly as I want to be on my own and have a house and a family and a career, I am scared of the process of getting there. I have an issue with happiness I think... I've gotten to the point where I don't really believe in it, just the idea that I can create my own little happiness world where I can pretend everything works. But now I'm afraid that if I really were happy or I got happiness out of anything, I wouldn't be able to recongize it...and I'd push it away like I've done so many times before.",female,17,Student,Leo,1

I arranged to meet him after work and bring him to this optical shop which alot of my friends swear that its CHEAP AND GOOD..haha  To my surprise, my brother reached my office at 530 sharp..wow..something different. Before 530, I was actually panicking in the office, because things has not been good between us.

Is there a thing call everlasting love? Wat is meant by everlasting love? A relationship which eventually leads to marriage? or A short relationship which last for less than a year..but that year was the happiest times that you ever have. But come again, if that year was the happiest period of time? How come the relationship didn't last? Seriously speaking, I have never dared to tell people around me abt everlasting relationships because there's no such thing as finding THE ONE. I think I will only know it when I'm old and feeble yet this guy can still hold my hand and walk around the streets. That's probably when I know that I've found the right one.   So what can I conclude? Marriage's a gamble? Something which you won't know whether you lost or win until old? We never know what a new relationship or a ending of a relationship might bring us...good or bad we never know. But the most important thing is to move on wif life. Gals wont' die without man..and man won't die without gals either..at this time in this day, everyone is independent. There's no longer such thing as guys must work hard so that next time can support the family, and there's no such things like as a woman you must follow what the man says. Times has changed..probably it has also changed our persepective on relationship...such changes have shaped the society and improve the economy but it has also changed the way people regard relationships..

Good money earned today because they paid me 15 bucks to drink some beverages and tell them whether its yummy or not. The whole process took me less than half an hour@!!..Good money heh...$$  After the survey, I went to AMK..because my naive brother bought a mobile phone from this mobile shop there and he kind of got cheated. The guy withheld the original nokia battery and gave him some compatible ones claiming that the compatible ones were better. Bullshit man, they probably take the original one and sell it to other ppl and make some money out of it. The phone came without a warrranty card somemore~ When I went down, the shop was a big one but then alot of young man with long bleached hair and tattooed arms..kind of scary though but hey..I'm not goody two shoes all the time. Luckily, they replaced the batteries with the original ones and gave me the warranty card if not..I'm gonna complain to CASE..after AMK yea..I""m back in the office at Bugis. It seems like I've done alot of travelling today~~  Later, I will be goin to Shaun's place for some potluck party. Not really a big party, but only Shaun, Jeff and their secondary school friends and myself. Kind of weird going because I don't even know their friends. My main worry is being feel left out.

Ya..its easy for me to try to get one to forgive the mistakes made by another one. Probably if it happens to me, I may not be that forgiving already. So for this, I'm not going to get J to forgive Y. All I can do is ask J to be fair to Y by reading her emails and reply if possible. If can't reply, then never mind. Y please understand afterall I'm closer to J and I can understand how hurt and angry J is.  What moved me was the way Y told me how sorry she was and how determined she is to changed. I told her the most impt thing is to change for herself and her family but not for anyone. Because in years to come if she realise that the one that she is changing for does not appreciate her effort..she will definitely have hatred..for him. Just like me. You know something, Y you do remind me of myself during my younger days..okie not that I'm very old..but years ago I was like you..fickle minded..not sure what I wanted.. and in turn I've hurt someone....and tell you the truth..I changed becausse of him..but after a few years..I realised that he didnt quite appreciate it at all..so now what..I hate that guy..but I think now..I'm already neutral abt it. Not much hatred..but just kind of sad to lose someone this way. So Y please..change for yourself..not others. If you determined..you will be able to do it.   As for J, you have been one of the few good friends who have stayed by my side for the past few years braving through winds and storms (wa..drama..) and of course not forgetting S..you were there for me too. I would say you two are one of the few friends which I want to keep for life. The trip from City Hall to Jurong East Mrt and from there back to the bustop to wait for bus 198 was hilarious. Hahaha..yea..I think you are right J accountants are crazy. Hahahaa....I hope you won't really mind me being friends with Y..:) and I do look forward to a few more good years of craziness..hahahahahahhaa  Seeing what happen between this two friends, somehow it really affected me very much. It suddenly brings me back to think..how easy it is for two to get together..not only as bfs or gfs..but also as friends..and how easy it is for one to spoil the relationship/friendship. It did dwell on me..that sometimes you must not take friends or ppl around you for granted...cos you never know..every little action that you do may just hurt them deeply.....it may be easy for them to forgive you for your action..but the truth is its difficult to forget.",female,23,Accounting,Sagittarius,1

118232,2938302,2004-06-18,"These few days had been terrible, especially today. I woke up alot of time last night because my eyes itch. This morning when I woke up my eye was really really swollen, red and painful. IT was really bad that I had to scream for my mother. I then started crying. For that moment I was really afraid that the worst feared situation is here..retinal detachment. But I guess not becuase I could still see clearly but still I was really scared so decided to take a day off and went to see my doctor. Doctor say its just some irritation Phew...yea laugh at me for being paranoid but you can't blame me for thinking this way.  After what my eye doctors told me recently I've been trying to surf the web to see what's retinal detachment. And its as follows..I've decided to put it here for ppl to see so as to spread the word around because I think it happens to anyone who has high myphoia and not only me.   Retinal Detachment      Normal Vision   The retina is the nerve cell layer of the eye and acts much like film in a camera. When light enters the eye, it passes through the cornea and lens and is focused onto the retina. The retina transforms the light energy into vision and sends the information back to the brain through the optic nerve. The macula is the sensitive, central part of the retina and provides for sharp, detailed vision.      Retinal Detachment   In retinal detachment, the retina separates from the outer layers of the eye thus losing its function. If not treated early, retinal detachment may lead to impairment or complete loss of vision.    Cause   Most retinal detachments are preceded by one or more tears or holes in the retina. Fluid passes through these openings and separates the retina from the adjacent layers of the eye.   Near-sighted individuals are more commonly affected due to thinning of the retina. Holes or tears can then develop in the thinned retina.   The vitreous (gel fluid in the eye) also plays a significant role by causing tugging on the retina especially when shrinkage occurs. Cataract surgery can also be a precipitating cause. A positive family history of retinal detachment is another risk factor.   A combination of factors is usually responsible for retinal detachment. Retinal detachments can also be caused by other diseases in the eye such as tumours, severe inflammations, or complications of diabetes.    Symptoms   Middle-aged and older persons may see floating black spots called floaters and flashes of light. In most cases, these symptoms do not indicate serious problems. In some eyes, the sudden appearance of spots or flashes of light may herald the onset of retinal detachment. A thorough examination of the retina by an ophthalmologist after dilatation of the pupil is necessary to determine the cause of the symptoms.   Some retinal detachments can proceed unnoticed until a large section of the retina is detached. In these instances, patients may notice the appearance of a dark shadow in some parts of their vision. Further development of the retinal detachment will blur central vision and create significant sight loss in the affected eye.   A few detachments may occur suddenly and the patient will experience a total loss of vision in one eye. Similar rapid loss of vision may also be caused by bleeding into the vitreous which may happen when the retina is torn.    Treatment   If the retina is torn but detachment has not yet occurred, prompt treatment may prevent the occurrence of a complete detachment. Once the retina becomes detached, it must be repaired surgically.    Laser Photocoagulation  When new small retinal tears are found with little or no nearby retinal detachment, the tears are sometimes sealed with a laser light. The laser places small burns around the edge of the tear. These produce scars that seal the edges of the tear and prevent fluid from passing through and collecting under the retina.    Freezing or Cryopexy   Freezing through the sclera (white of the eye) behind a retinal tear will also stimulate scar formation and seal down the edges.    Surgical Repair   Successful reattachment of the retina consists of sealing the retinal tear with a silicone material which is sutured to the sclera (white of the eye) to indent the eye ball inwards. Freezing applications are then used to bind the retina to the underlying layers.   Newer procedures have been developed to achieve the same result using the injection of a gas into the eye in suitable cases. The surgery may be performed under local or general anaesthesia depending on the procedure, age and general health of the patient.   In more complex retinal detachments, it may be necessary to use a technique called vitrectomy. This operation removes the vitreous body from the eye. In some cases, when the detached retina itself is severely shrunken or scarred, air or gas may have to be used to fill the vitreous cavity temporarily.    Prognosis   Over 90% of all retinal detachments can be reattached by modern surgical techniques. Occasionally, more than one operation may be required. The degree of vision which finally returns about six months after successful surgery depends upon a number of factors.   * This is a general guide. If in doubt, please consult your doctor.",female,23,Accounting,Sagittarius,1

118234,2938302,2004-06-08,"Been feeling moody ever since I came back from my doctor's appointment on Wednesday. My eyes are getting from bad to worst. Most shocking news that the doctors told me..my retinals are weak, there is a very high chance of getting retinal detachment. So I asked the doctor what could be done to prevent this from happening. The doctor then told me to go back on 7 July 2004 to see another doctor who specialised in retinal detachments to decide if it is advisable to go for an op to prevent it from happening. Upon hearing that, I lost all my mood by hey I know retinal detachment is not really rare. I know it happens to people like me who has high mypoia but you can't help feeling worried abt it because its my EYES that I'm talking about here. And if you have been to see an eye doctor before you will know how terrible it feels to have those strong bright lights shining right into your eyes. Its just so..so..glaring and you have to follow the instructions and its so tedious..""look at my right ear..look upper right, extreme right,..bottom right.."" all these instructions I can even memorise them. And its not just doing one time on each eye. I have to do two times for each eye..and worst still sometimes more than that. Yea I know I got to be patient, but its really glaring and painful.

129573,3424020,2004-05-22,"all my relatives were quite proud of when i decided to stop the nasty habit. but i have definitely felt the need to relieve myself, and since i have quit growing pot, smoking seems to be the easiest, legal way to pursue my human drug abuse behavior. 1st fag - things tend to increase in complexity and the always present feeling of strangeness within me is getting stronger. sometimes i like to use the notion of being out of sync with reality.  currently my diploma thesis fills every hour of my day, even when i am not writing. it is about dsp algorithms realized with dedicated floating point hardware, and the goal is to do it as generic as possible in a hdl of my choice. although through most of my university time vhdl has been the dominant hdl, verilog has been present since the early 80s, however the inflexibility quickly led me back to vhdl. my field of interest can be described by hardware/software systems engineering, and considering my grades i am a first class hardware geek. One of my dreams has always been this one big bang scientific thesis to end my studies and begin my diversified work in a renowned high tech company. dreams tend to fulfill themselves the way they want, they develop their own personality along the way.  2nd fag - when i did the necessary research for my thesis i skimmed through every possibly related book in the library of our institute. needless to say i read the majority of them already during the past 3 years. because one of my co-workers is a registered ieee member he has web access to all scientific papers related to computer science. this was the material i desperately needed: thousands of papers directly dealing with floating point hardware. concisely presented, fascinating material - i already envisioned my big bang thesis.  3rd fag - now what could possibly irritate me in a way so that i start smoking after all this time? it is my personal insight that with my current scientific knowledge i wont ever be able to produce a thesis competing with the papers i have read on ieee. i always experienced that mankind's knowledge was hard to grasp as a whole, however now, trying to implement the already existing mathematical facts into high performance silicon, it just seems impossible. along the way of this perception process i must have lost my motivation and now deadlines concerning my thesis are closing in and i am thinking of packing in on my scientific career. metal bands like amon amarth have strengthened me, but now their lyrics raise the wish to just run off into the woods and live like a human being is meant to live - hunting for food, basking under the blue sky, not fearing death as it is the natural effect of life.  4th fag - i am 23 now and when i just continue my life the way i did, the feeling to be out of sync with reality will inescapably increase. science and politics are more connected than i originally anticipated. every society tries to breed a scientific elite to prevail in future conflicts. perhaps all these new opinions of mine evolved by reading ""The Selfish Gene"" by Richard Dawkins which explores the relatively new field of memetics. every idea, every opinion, every kind of art represents a meme spreading itself throughout the human race infesting our brains. the ultimate impetus of such memes is, like genes, domination through reproduction. in my opinion the ongoing search in every human being for a sense in life is obstructed by the complexity of the currently circulating memes. when every meme occupies a certain amount of brain capacity according to its complexity, then the individual search for truth is somewhat limited. the more we allow foreign memes to infest our brains the more we adopt to foreign truths making them our own.",male,23,Technology,Pisces,0

130038,4094511,2004-07-30,"There are funnier things in life than those that last comics stand with. The real joke of living, is getting along. Rodney King, is not my hero, as so I hope he is not yours. His message, however a ringing bell in the backs of our ears, just behind the eardrum. The bell begins to take shape at birth, and eventually in life, as the Liberty Bell it cracks. Why can't we all just get along? Honestly, why?  I am not a genius, though my IQ argues this with me. Not that, yet also not a moron. Yes, I claim to be a fool, but that is a birth right. I can easily see why we do not get along, will not get along, and cannot get along. We have different ideas of love, religion, philosophy, art, entertainment, and even pet peeves o'plenty. This in itself is not such a bad thing. It creates our diversity, which in many ways simply just makes life all the more interesting. We, however feel this blustering, ecumenical need to trample, crucify, and destroy the feelings of others.  Scenario: You think that love does not exist. You want to live you life and bed whomever, whenever, no strings attached. This does not give you the right to approach in desire to obstruct the life of someone who believes in love, and is in love. That being said, you figure that everybody should feel as you do towards the idea of love, so in turn you are doing this ""lover"" a favor by destroying his hopes. You spoon feed your conscious on empty words from a bad episode on Beverly Hills 90210, or some sleazy soap opera. Well, maybe is life were rehearsed, edited, shot for time, and scored you would be doing us a favor. Ultimately, however life is not a movie. If it were, might not you be the villain? Do you like being the villain? Have you always had fantasies about being Bluto when Popeye never finds Spinach? Does this entertain you? Do you need to create a website, where you bed wed mothers? Is that hour (if you are lucky) of pleasure which is not supreme to the million other hours you have done this, worth crushing the spirit of some young husband, who would be a better husband has his wife not read a Harlequin Romance novel and could not measure him to Bartholomew David Anglosberg (the stud from the book). Do you even know what the word Harlequin means? With Webster, and Doubleday by my side I certainly do. Harlequins are clowns, or buffoons. Your assumption has surely made a harlequin out of you.  Another scenario: I personally find atheism to be a very inarticulate, unlearned, lazy, and egotistical way to believe. I am a Christian. If I tell you that your beliefs make you a buffoon (there is that word again), I will be strung up to the proverb's post and burned like Joan of Arc. Though, you personally as a ""non-conformist"" (also known as someone who conformed to nonconformity which basically makes you conform anyway...hmmmm), decide that any faith is a joke. You find it amusing to trample persons of faith with your uneducated and Xeroxed approved rhetoric. This time however I am a villain, because you are speaking with a unique tongue (or so society would proclaim). Unique, give me a break, most of the atheist approach is an overused series of arguments formed by people who's knowledge then, would make yours now, look as if it couldn't fill a hollow water melon seed.  Then there is abortion, cloning, gun control, death penalty, and several other life philosophies. On each side of each argument are more uneducated esteem juiced beef cakes to make the head's head explode. We call people on the opposite side of us ignorant. Yet, the very definition of ignorance is a condition of misinformation. In this case I have to ask.....How does one know which is being played. We all come to our conclusions based on the knowledge we have. Who is to say which knowledge is truth? Couldn't we all be brainwashed to some degree? If one man reads ten books nine of which are fictional, and another reads one book of nonfiction, which man is more informed? Think about that. A degree from Yale, could ultimately be a degree of dung that money has made into fertilizer. Therefore a degree from Crustation Corner High School, may be fertilizer, though people keeping stepping in it, and calling it dung.  Ultimately in everything all we really have to go on in all opinions, beliefs, and ways of life , is faith. Faith is all we have. Face it, we may all be fool of dung, our faith is what fertilizes us and makes us grow. So in this, should we not respect the faiths of others, and discuss our differences, yet tread lighter on theirs.

Life is grand, the fool is galloping through a life, where his debts are yet repaid.  I had a conversation with a man today. We both spoke the universal language of beauty. He asked me how my love life was, and I told him of my gorgeous treasure. I asked him of his, and he told me of a gorgeous diamond. Jaded, as I usually am it was today that I understood, all me are struck by beauty. While beauty comes in many different shapes and sizes, and is truly in the eyes of the beholder...the beheld are almost gods or goddesses (depending of your preference) to our small worlds. Which leads me to another point, it's really not a small world after all. The world is only small when we make it so. When we surround ourselves with beauty, love, laughter, fresh air, and hints of God, the world is huge. The air is so abundant that we can't breathe enough. The trees are so green that they take on an unnamed color. The sky is so blue, that heaven seems to be a calm and peaceful ocean, that we all dare sail.  We are the sons of no one? Not quite, we are the sons of this world, its creator, and even its bad seed. However, we are bastards of young. Fatherless to the thought of aging. For life is indeed eternal, even to the atheist.

148015,4194617,2004-08-16,"The Oregon Zoo, to which my lovely wife and I are members, has a couple of good things to do to beat the summer heat. One of our favs is the Polar Bear exhibit. On a hot summer day, they're likely to be swimming, and it's a hoot to watch them from underground. They are great, hairy, graceful behemoths in the water. Kids tend to crowd the windows and bang on the glass, which their idiot parents freely allow. I don't let that bad behavior to spoil my experience but as a result, I do find myself planting myself in front of windows and other views with no guilt, even though I block it for others for a brief time- it's just a self-defense thing.   The other fav of mine is the Lorikeets, whom you can feed for $1. They are colorful and noisy, and not afraid to take what they want. They'll also poop on unsuspecting bystanders so you have to watch out. People love to give small children food cups for the birds, only to watch the more timid kids wail in fear when the birds dive in for the food.   Kids are also frequently frightened by the Himalamazon thrill ride, which is kind of a movie/roller coaster combo. I like it because it is air-conditioned excitement - we went with my brother in-law yesterday and because the kid beside him cried and his seat had to be stopped, we all 3 got another free ride. Wahoo!   In the cool bat cave, the fox bats will happily dine on fruit and broccoli, as well as try to mate. I saw one male try to move in behind a female and mate with her, but she reached up between her legs and nipped his little balls and put an end to that. I had to laugh - she plainly said, ""Take that, you impudent little bugger!""  Some people say the zoo is for little kids, but my wife and I disagree. It's plainly for adults who love animals and nature and for older and braver kids.",female,47,Education,Cancer,1

We took the venerable Yellow Line down to Waterfront Park and joined the throngs for some excellent King salmon in Pinot Gris huckleberry sauce, some fondue in a tiny bread bowl (from a German restaraunt called the ""Berlin Inn"" that claims it will hosting ""Barktoberfest"" in a few weeks), some very tasty Marionberry pie and some excellent zydeco. It's all about ""Brand Oregon"" this year, and berries were represented very well. It's so good!   I swear I've never seen so many Hawaiian shirts.

148017,4194617,2004-08-14,"Last night my sweetie got off early from work and we celebrated by going to the ""Lovely Hula Hands"" restaraunt off super trendy Mississippi Avenue. It's a remodeled house kind of not near anything, really - hard to find unless you spot its bright pink exterior as you happen to be driving by on the way to somewhere else. It was lovely food, don't know whose hula hands prepared it.  Then we drove out into the Gorge on the Old Scenic Highway, which is still scenic even at night. We stopped at a small park up a few hundred feet elevation from the Columbia River called ""Women's Forum Park"" (odd name), because it had a low-lit spot for looking at the stars. It was just 20 miles out of Portland, but what a difference it makes to be away from all that light pollution! We lay on our backs in the grass and snuggled as we watched the meteors zip by, and tried to keep over over-excited dog from barking at everyone else.   Our sweet dog is a 70-pound, gorgeous chocolate lab mix from the Multnomah County Animal Shelter. We love her dearly. Although she gets taken to Portland Parks routinely, she almost never goes out at night, and the spookiness of the dark brought out her inner watchdog. She just wouldn't settle down and shut up. After a spell of trying to amuse herself by lying on her back in imitation of us, she grew bored and kept standing over us and goofily looking down in our faces and blocking our view as we tried to look up at the stars, walking on our heads and other body parts, and tangling us up in her leash. She finished her evening banished to the back of the car.   Nonetheless, it was most romantic and a wonderful August evening.",female,47,Education,Cancer,1

Oh, and that pesky situation in the middle east.   Anyway, for those of us actually paying attention, we enjoyed a very interesting juxtaposition of styles. Bush played to a small group of invitation-only small business owners in Beaverton. Kerry held a huge rally in Portland's Waterfront Park to which anyone could come. There were lots of body blows, hair pulling and illegal chair usages.

148020,4194617,2004-08-11,"Today is the second day of a ""severe smog alert"" here in the City of Roses. I could see it, taste it and even feel the weight of it on the drive home from Salem - a brown haze that obliterated the views of the mountains, reminded me of L.A., and caused me to want to drive like some kind of crazed fiend to get out of it and stop contributing to it. The sick thing is, our air quality is still rated ""good"". Compared to what?! I shudder to think.  Nothing sours my psyche more, because I've always felt a slightly smug little spark of joy knowing that the air quality here has always been better than most other places I've lived in my life. It is due in part to a series of 90+ degree days - another thing people don't think about when they imagine Portland. But, an arid desert we do become each summer. It is normally a coolish green city with lots of trees and fresh air and more than its fair share of misty rain.   Simultaneouly, and perhaps even more frightening, global warming is being blamed for the new dead zone that covers an alarming range of Oregon coastline. Everything in its path is killed due to oxygen depleted cold waters that creep up from the deep. It's kind of like all those deaths caused by earthquakes near ancient lakes that are filled with toxic gasses trapped near the lakebed an held in place by algea.   Yuck.

148021,4194617,2004-08-11,"When my lovely lesbian wife and I first moved to the Rose City, we lived in a trendy NE neighborhood. It was, by PDX standards, a pain in the ass. Too crowded, too noisy, piggish neighbors, and way too much traffic. Given that Bridgetown is one easy place to get around, that's saying something.  Soon, we came to our senses and moved to what is rapidly becoming another trendy neighborhood. Now we live in hot hot hot Overlook. We are rather pleased with ourselves for picking so well (although we still have some piggish neighbors).  Yes, we lucky denizens of NoPo (that's North Portland to the less hip among us) get to ride the newly opened Light Rail line, a line colored yellow for cheerfulness and optimism. The line has all sorts of cool art embedded in it, on the stations, along the sidelines, in the accompanying new businesses, and there's even poetry on the inside of the trains. It gives us something to look at while we are trying to avoid making eye contact with the crazy/drunk/hostile homeless person sitting across from us.  It is the yellow line of hope that will take me down to the Waterfront on Friday to see John Kerry stumping in Stumptown. I understand such luminaries as Jon Bon Jovie and Leonarda diCaprio (or ""de Craprio"" as someone once called him) will be joining the party. I'm happy to have them join the dogpile and all, but neither of these glam fellows exactly appeals to the prototypical Portland dweller's sense of style. We're quirky here and we like things a little dark around the edges; not too easily accessed; not too marketable by the mainstream.",female,47,Education,Cancer,1

We stayed there for like five mintues then we all piled into Munjal's Mom's minivan. Alfred and I were talking in teh back and Jeff kept tell us to shut up... but i didn't see teh reason:). We arrived at our destination (which was teh Computer Fair)  at about 11:30. There was a Cheerleading Compitition going on or something because there was ALOT of Cheerleaders(about 500-600). Munjal and Jeff got lucky and didn't have to pay the $8 entrance fee but me and Alfred weren't so lucky. Once we got in the fair we walked around the booths and noticed there was a Adult Section, we were tempted to go in (no one was looks and i think no one cared either... What a country!!!) We walked around somemore.About 12:00 i made my first purchase, which was a 450 watt power supply(Which is a vast improvment over my old 300 watt power supply). After about 15mintues of more walking and mulling around we went to the other building (hehehe). I kept telling Alfred not to mess with the Asains because you never know if they know Karate or some other Marital Arts to kick your ass with. Then Alfred thought of asking all the salepeople if all the prices were in American Currency, it was funny for a while then it got kinda old (but funny nonetheless). I found a table where they were selling Tri-flame lighters, I was pondering whether or not just to take it and walk away but i deicided to be a good kid and pay for it (besides it was cheap any ways,$3!!!!). So me and Alfred walked outside because Munjal and Jeff went to find a Dual-layer DVD burner. Then me and Alfred went to the table were the lighters were and bought Alfred one. On the way back from that raunting trip i found a wire-less keyboard and mouse for $30 but i only had $22, so Alfred was a good friend and spotted me $8 :). After the Computer Fair we came to my house. my Grandma ordered pizza and then we had the bright idea to go to Seven-Eleven which is about 1/4 mile away from my house up a very very slight incline over a stretch of road about 1000 feet it might be yards i don't know...When we came back i took  a picture for his fake Canadian school ID.

158485,4121937,2004-08-04,"In Johannesburg electric fencing seems to be the norm, and I always believed that is was not necessary down here in Cape Town. We don't live in an upmarket suburb, but close to town and houses here are not cheap, but then they aren't cheap anywhere in Cape Town anymore.    We have quite a few families living in our road, with lots of little kids, and the domestics all know each other, go to the park or the local cafe together, and walk to the station after work. So it's not like it's a deserted road during the day which would kind of be more enticing for burglars.    It all started a few weeks ago, the first incident was that our domestic worker was in the house when somebody was trying to kick down our back door. We have great alarming and panic buttons all over, so she reacted fast and the guy ran off.    Two weeks later, same kind of scenario, but she now saw the guy, a person wearing a balaclava and carrying a panga knife. Again she reacted and the police arrived quickly as did the armed response. No sign of the guy though.    Last week it got considerably worse. Our nanny was putting our smallest child down for a nap, walked back to the kitchen to see a man in the house. She screamed, he turned around saw her, started cursing her, grabbed a knife out of his socks or shoes and walked toward her. She ran, screaming, opened the front door, activated the panics, - all the neighbours came out, and actually saw the guy face to face as he ran off down the road. He of course wasn't caught, but I don't even care about that. Our little one woke up in midst of all the screaming and he is still not well, he keeps talking about it and waking up at night. I just get really mad, the bastards, coming into the house like that.    However, we were all truly shaken and made some frantic phonecalls to a whole lot of customers and withing 24 hours we had the whole bloody place surrounded by electric fencing. All modern, connected to alarms, panics, sirens, armed response etc. Doesn't look as bad as I feared, and worth the peace of course.   Haven't bothered putting up warning signs yet, and am secretly hoping someone will come and try climb over the walls again.

158486,4121937,2004-08-03,"Having grown up in Germany, a country that prides itself on efficiency and cleanliness, living in South Africa, with all kind of bugs being part of life, can sometimes be a bit taxing. Well so I thought, I never realized how bad it can get.   Until   Saturday morning.    We live in Cape Town, and it is winter here, and very cold and rainy. So this very vibey, trendy restaurant in town, decided to hold a Christmas in July charity ball. Beautifully organised, the whole place set out in glittering, shiny Christmas decorations, a marquee in front of it, with a stage and dance floor. Lots of entertainment, magicians that come to the table, body painted ""artists"" twisting and doing yoga kind of movements for you. Music, food stations, everything. Came at a fee, but the proceeds go to a charity for Aids orphans, so every penny was worth spent.    As I'm not very good at doing my own hair I booked an appointment in a salon for a wash and blow dry. Normal thing. I had been a few days before. When I arrived, I saw the stylist look up from her magazine with a more than usual ""I've been waiting for you"" look. Just something in her eyes made me think: what's that about, I'm not late..   Instead of sending me straight to the basin for the wash thing, she said, ""have a seat.""    ""I noticed you have a very dry scalp."" She continued. Then she started examining my hair, putting clips in it, moving strands of hair around and then turning to her collegue, calling her over. The funky purple haired collegue came over, took a look, nodded - and left. Just like that.    I felt my heart beat go up, we do live in Africa and I have 3 children, two of which are at school. And when people start investigating your hair like that, you kind of have an inkling of what the hell is going on.    ""I'm awfully sorry, but you have nits in your hair"" -    Yes,you heard right, nits as in lice! OHHH my God. It all came to me in an instant. There had been an outbreak of lice at one of my kids schools, and we had struggled to get rid of it, I won't bore you with the details. Of course, I never, ever ,thought that I could catch it, and I wasn't sure who to kill first, or if I should just drop dead myself, right there.    ""You are kidding? Nits? That can't be! Are you sure? "" I asked. The stylist continued to tell me that,apparently they had had a problem at the salon, that there had been some kind of lice epidemic, and that a few of their ""ladies"" had been affected. - Didn't believe a word. She just said that to make me feel better, or to try and pretend that this was no big deal. But she didn't fool me. Sweet as she was. She kind of apologized that she was not able to touch my hair and could I please go home and sort it out. I kind of pretended I didn't know what to do, and she filled me in that the pharmacists have special shampoos etc.    I then asked her how on earth I can get up and leave without dying of embarrassment, and she assured me that no-one knew and I could just go. LOL. Another lie. ALL the stylists knew,I'm sure.    Well, I just got up with my messy, nit infested hair and walked out.    Outside I immediately grabbed my mobile phone and called my husband who was at a play center for little kids called Dingy Dungles in our family, better known as Jimmy Jungles in the adult world.    He answered and asked me how things were. I gave him hell, telling him that I was not good at all, that we can cancel the bloody ball, and that I was going to kill each of the three kids, and that it was his fault for having so many kids and that he chose a bad school which was lice infested.    He knows me well, and loves me, he started laughing, and said buy the lice stuff and I'll meet you at home and I will help you get the nits out.    So I bought some lice killing new age plus lice spray, a nailpolish which was on sale, a conditioner, a bubble bath at the pharmacy. On my way to the parking lot I bought a pair of black and silver highheels ( also on sale).    At home, my husband swore I had nothing of the sorts in my hair, while pulling little bits of ""dry scalp"" out..    I landed up putting rollers in my hair and wasn't to unhappy with my appearence in the end, considering the circumstances.    So we went to the ball and it was great, although it was also not what it was supposed to be, but that's a story for another day....   Oh, I won't even bother mentioning what I discovered when I checked the two older kids hair... Fact is, the pharmacy scored when my husband hotfooted it there to do another purchase. :)   I don't know if I will ever go back to that hairdresser though, I'm still trying to figure out a story I can tell them when I go back.

167658,878542,2002-09-30,"The Below post, besides a desperate grab for webspace, whilst getting kicked out of the Library(which is apparently closing earlier on weekends now..  ) is an illustration of what I call a nested context. Don't bother googling, I'm pretty sure it's a neologism. Basically, this is a simple way of looking at the larger environment which thoughts and concepts live in. If you're familiar with the concept of memes, it's a little easier to explain. In fact, if you aren't, please go read on  urlLink  that. .   A nested context is like a matrioska doll. Each memeplex of ideas is contained within another, with the top layer reacting against your base personality. In the below example, Zen is the outermost layer. Not Zen Buddhism as such, but a derivative state of mind or rather, no-mind. It's a mental stance I assume when I'm preparing to do some mental work. So all the contextual feelings and concepts related to this Zen state fill my mind. And then, the next layer, I attempt to focus. Focusing your mind, for me, is a specific process, where I deliberately set aside most concious processes, in a very specific and identifiable mental action. Leaving only the next conceptual layer.   Which is Python. When I think of Python, I'm filled with concepts I've learned recently, code I admire, code I plan to write, and documentation I've read recently. I then turn to my Code, the second to last layer, and possibly the most specific. The code in front of me, completes my focusing of mind, and is where I do most of my work. But there is another layer, of Application, which is the larger purpose of that code. I tend to vacillitate between these two layers, but neither is far from my mind.   Now, obviously, this is not a rigid or literal construction of mind. If I were to be shocked, and lose concentration, I would not, for example, find myself in a higher level of the nested context. But rather this is a way of representing both the process of thought, and of the elements that make up concious processes. And it may be useful to you as a tool, for analysing the real source of thought. Now, I could expand the nested context, and include even more outward layers, all the way to basic processes of mind, but I limited my radius of attention in this case, in order to illustrate the concept. You may expand with this technique as far as convenience and your own knowledge of cognitive science allow.",male,23,Technology,Leo,0
167659,878542,2002-09-25,"I'm going to include a post of mine to  urlLink SL4 . This is because it encapsulates an opinion of mine rather well, and I have no wish to rehash the topic. This occurred because of a discussion on the above forum, where it was claimed that psycho-active substances, such as DMT, LSD, or non-hallucinagins such as MDMA, could represent a method of 'mind-expansion' or creative enlightenment. I am not opposed to drug use, I see it as a victimless activity, and people should be allowed to do whatever they wish to themselves if they possess an understanding of the consequences.   What I am opposed to, is irrational behavior, and misrepresentation of irrational behavior as superior to, or even alternative to, rational thought and behavior. With that in mind, I'm going to repost my rebuttal to an apologist for mind-expansive drug use. In an earlier post, he basically re-submits Dr. Leary's suggestion that hallucinagins can function on the level of a re-organization of mental state, which can have beneficial effects in terms of insights, moral transcencion and lasting attitude adjustment. my reply follows.   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------   I am not a neurochemical professional, even so, as an interested bystander, I am struck by the way that this thread has progressed, with very little attention having been given to the relative biological danger inherent in most of the drugs under discussion.   MDMA and it's parent MDA, which David Cake upholds as ""quite reasonable for particular purposes"" is a stimulant, and a relative of the extraordinarily negative Methamphetamine or ""Crystal Meth"". Even excluding the research of Dr. George Ricaurte of John Hopkins, which suggests that significant 'structural' damage is incurred through MDMA use over time, we know that MDMA plays a major role as a serotonin re-uptake inhibitor, and the relatively negative neurochemical effects of this are well documented.   In order to explain my objections to LSD, often touted as a very safe drug, as it is neither openly neurotoxic, nor does it have well understood side effects, I'm going to adopt a more narrative tone. Having been involved with drugs in my youth, I can say with some certainty that there are few, if any, effects, culture, or side-effects of common psychoactive drugs which I have not experienced or witnessed first-hand. This experience makes me doubt people who use arguments to the effect of ""If you haven't tried drugs, you can't talk about them"". In my experience, people who are involved in drugs gain no special knowledge of the safety, chemical aftereffects, or effect upon intelligence of the drugs, which they believe they are electing to experience.   These ""observers"" are collecting their special information with minds that they are simultaneously dosing with unknown levels of psychoactive drugs, many of which are psychologically and physically addictive. The mind is a delicate thing. Our primitive cerebrums only weakly support rationality under the best conditions, and screwing around with hormonal or chemical balances within that complex system has predictable results. Most drug users I have observed are under the impression that the insights they produced while under the influence of psychoactive substances were intensely moving, complex and significant, and that as they 'come down' they lose the ability to appreciate or comprehend their previous insights. Some of their conclusions are, I submit, very weird. Few appeared to me to be either coherent or inspired instead appearing as permutations, distortions or even perversions of earlier insights held by the user, or at best irrational concatenations.   The claim of LSD ""opening up one's mind"" or allowing ""new insights"" is a result I lay mostly upon the fact that it functions both as a seratonin analogue and increases dopamine production significantly. Both of these clinical effects lead towards premature, unwarranted and precipitate instigation of mental closure, which leads the subject to assume that since mental closure is reached, a conclusion must have been forthcoming. Since memories are filed according to the observerï¿½s interpretation of events, the subject remembers such moments as possessing great clarity and insight, when in fact the biological structures for detecting clarity of thought and mental completion are merely being triggered inappropriately.   The negative side affects of LSD (other than it appears not infrequently to inspire irrational behavior and beliefs, bad-trip nightmares, self-mutilation, and dangerous behavior) lie in the fact that it functions both as a serotonin re-uptake inhibitor, and is psychologically addictive. (I consider most addictions to be bad news, as they introduce irrational behavior, and introduces a new thought factor not grounded in reality basis, aside for the desire to repeat the experience).   This above discussion ignores the fact that most psychoactive substances are illegal in many countries, and because of this available drugs tend to be of uncertain composition, and often arbitrary dosage. The wisdom of ingesting completely unknown substances advertised as psychoactive drugs, obtained from people who smuggle, steal, murder, and occasionally write incoherent poetry is a decision, which under these circumstances cannot be entirely separated from the inherent toxicity of the supposed makeup of said drugs.

167660,878542,2002-09-23,"Once more into the breach, as the internet has not yet been restored to my household.   The wonder of the Library is that it's almost free. What you give up, is privacy and a little bit of pride. It's always amusing to see the difference between Barnes & Noble, with it's pristine carpets, new books, wide selection, designer coffee, and the Public Library, with it's dingy carpets,unilluminating help, and ratty reference section. The Library can sometimes have works the store does not, but the funding tends to even it out a little bit.  The perfect marriage between these is the University Library. With the mandate to support their local scholars, a budget to match, and the subscriptions to research periodicals a mad scientist can envy, the University Library is a much more pleasant place to steal internet access, and get a little real-worldish research in. It's sad that when I was a child, my mother was always telling me to get my face out of the book and join the real world. Now I see books, and think of them as more real than where I usually am.   In other news, a recent brush with the  urlLink MAN  has given me a new respect for the powers that be. In respect for that, I've upped my PGP Key size, and renewed my CCW. Kidding aside, I would like to say one thing. It is a dangerous thing when people need not take responsibility for their actions personally. Hierarchy and impersonal organizations allow one to ""just follow orders"" or be ""defending the country"". As Bertrand Russel once observed ""murder is against the law everywhere, unless it is in large numbers to the sound of trumpets and flags."". Be wary of allowing someone to do for a government or organization, what you could not concience allowing him to do for himself. For he is still doing it, in his name's or another.

Now, as much as I love the internet, I'm not sure it will replace the lovely ambience inherent in stacks and stacks of books. The problem, is that it's lovely if you know where your desired information is. But if you're searching for information in a library, why it's the most frustrating thing in the world. By the end of your search for a decent book, you're making plans to forcibly install a  urlLink Google  interface.   But it's not all bad. Being a physical person, there has always been something reassuring about the weight and heft of a book in my hands.

167662,878542,2002-09-18,"I've decided to make my first real post on this blog on the subject of rational thought. On  urlLink SL4  there has been a recent flurry of activity on the subject of rational thought, what it means to be rational, and whether there exist arational/irrational sources of evidence.   The nature of this discussion leads to very high tempers, so I'm going try a different tack. I'm going to use the microuniverse of  MineSweeper . Now, MineSweeper is a popular computer game(though not nearly as popular as Solitaire, unfortunately) largely because it comes bundled with lots of Operating Systems. Every Window's package I've ever had the privilige to attempt to use came with one; The Red Hat/KDE package I'm using now came with an implementation; OSX has it's own, IIRC; if you're really without minesweeper, you poor baby, get it  urlLink here.  this is a java game, but it works pretty well.  Minesweeper is an entirely regular and understandable game with completely understandable underlying rules. What concerns me in this discussion, is the way people play and understand it. The information provided to you in a standard minesweeper game is sufficient to solve it, given that you survive long enough to gather some lower bound of information. In fact, most minesweeper games appear to contain the most risk in the first 5 clicks or so. However, the important losses occur after the first 5 clicks, when the game has progressed, yet the player still loses, in spite of, or perhaps because of the information s/he has.   In order to solve this mystery, play a couple of games of minesweeper. Now, when you were playing, after a while, were you absolutely sure you were right, when you clicked on a mine and ended your game?(this paragraph assumes you lost at least once, if you did not, you are either a rational reasoner, or you've already mentally solved minesweeper; go away) . Now, this uncertainty is because you aren't playing Minesweeper as an entirely rational process. I'll explain.   Minesweeper's simple rules lead to interactions, which lead to the numbers and blanks you reveal by clicking. Analysing those numbers and blanks, within that context, gives you information. A rational process is one that takes information about the world(in this case, minesweeper) and assigns it strengths and priorities in keeping with actual facts. ((ex: a 1 implies there is only one mine within 1 block, that's a certainty; you've never seen a mine be in the upper left hand corner, that's fantastically unlikely to be right, and doesn't include a reason why there wouldnt' be, so there is no chance that it's right for the right reasons; ergo, you can rely on the former, but the latter is a fools bargain)). Rational processes are not wrong. They are in line with reality, and thus the world(minesweeper). If you recieve a wrong result, either your process is not rational, you executed your process incorrectly, or you applied your process inappropriately. Irrational Processes, like praying for a blank block, selecting the four corners, blind guessing, or always selecting to the left may in fact succeed occasionally, and may out of statistical anomaly even make more than 50% success. But you are not making the right block choices for real reasons. Irrational actions don't take information, make justified conclusions from that, and generalize, as rational processes do, they either act on information that is invented, percieved(but not extant) patterns, or simple whim.   Only rational processes can allow one to win a game of minesweeper reliably, because rational processes are in line 100% with the larger universe. Minesweeper is very simple, and it's easy to see what processes are rational or not, because irrational ones lead to ended games.   Generalize to the Real World. Suddenly, the nature of the argument changes. What constitutes a justifiable conclusion from evidence? What's really evidence? What about people who seem to have powers or knowledges from elsewhere?(supernaturalism) It seems like the world is too much to deal with 100% certainty.   The real answer is that it's not actually any more complicated to make individual decisions rationally. Lets look at what carries over from Minesweeper.   1. Only one real world. There is only one minesweeper board, and wishing for another arrangement won't change where the mines are. The only way you get anywhere is by abiding by that arrangement, and reacting to it. The world is the same. There is only one physical world you live in. The people next door live in the same world. Soliphists(people who believe the universe to be imaginary) still get killed by trucks. And no amount of wishing or hoping, or thinking seems to change anything about the world.  2.   The world is consistent. The relationships within minesweeper, the way numbers translate into mines and blocks, never changes. Next game, the mines don't give different results, and patterns within one game that are applicable, still apply within the next. The world is the same. Gravity remains constant, fields interact the same way, day to day. There is no such thing as a physics of epochs. Time periods always were and always will be subject to the same basic rules. That said, somethings are very variable. Social structures, human relationships, these are high-level dependent structures that change through time, just as the individual positions of mines between games. But there is an underlying consistency that continues throughout.  3. Truth is self-supporting. If something works within minesweeper, it works for a reason. There are no supernatural elements. The real world has phenomena, and all such phenomena, and all objects within the real world, follow rules. If something is true, the surrounding environment reflects this. True facts is the only supportable objects, because all other facts support them.   Rational thought is not a force, it's not an object, and it's not a person. It is a special kind of relationship, between evidence, behavior, and conclusion. A formal exegesis of this relationship exists, it's called the Bayesian Probability Theorem. Basically, this theorem describes how you relate different kinds of evidence into a cohesive conclusion, that remains inline with the universe. (if you are not familiar with the theorem, start  urlLink here ). My friend  urlLink Eliezer Yudkowsky  is what you would formally call a Bayesian Rationalist.(he considers the Bayesian Evidencial process superior to the more traditional Popperian approach). But I would call him a BPT enthusiast. He invokes the BPT at almost every opportunity, citing it as the basis of rationality. As a detail-oriented person, I must disagree. The Bayesian Probability Theorem is not the well from which rationality springs, nor is it the basis of all rational thought. It is a formalization of the relationship that Evidence has to Conclusion within said rational thought.   Formalism aside, Rational conclusions are the only conclusions worth making, because they're the conclusions that work the most. If you aren't using your best judgement, you may as well give up. Otherwise your making the wrong decisions for the wrong reasons, even if you occasionally get lucky. And as my friend Eliezer says. ""That's worse than nothing.""",male,23,Technology,Leo,0

167666,878542,2002-10-17,"Some time ago, I noticed that conflict resolution, in order to be successful, often requires that the resolving party be familiar with the nature and character of conflict.   Accordingly, I have researched the matter, and it seems nearly universal. So I am led to an inescapable conclusion, that the successful avoidance and resolution of conflict in my future will require my familiarity and skill with the tools and techniques of conflict, which, for the purposes of discussion will involve hostile intelligences of peer level. (The possibility of hostile intelligences of infra-justin level, and super-justin level are fundamentally different problems and require different solutions.(peer level in this case encompasses the multitude of human level opponnents at this point. I see no reason or inclination to expand this range further, as both a dog bent upon my destruction, and a hostile transhuman seem to bear no real insight in mentioning.))  It is helpful to remember and injunction of Nietzche: ""When fighting monsters, one must take care not to become a monster oneself"".   However, in order to fully understand threats, one must delve (perhaps dangerously) into the psychology, and application of  violence .   Violence is something human beings and most mammals are very good at, generally. Our evolutionary history is littered with violent adaptations and such nasty things. Interestingly however, the more structured complicated forms of violence that our abstract reasoning allows us to achieve, like wars, terrorism, and taxes appear to follow similar patterns to the more simple mammal to mammal violence our species developed with. Given this surface similarity, investigating the roots of violence leads one to the urge to categorize. I dont' like categorizing, I think axioms and similar nonsense simplify and badly fit the situations one finds oneself experiencing. However, it's occasionally useful to have rules of thumb to apply.   There are seemingly two basic strategies within violence of various brands.    1. Playing to Advantages You Have;  This is a relatively straightforward strategy, you have reach, so you stay far, you have money, so you force your opponnent into a bidding war. Forcing the conflict into arenas where you have relative strengths can take many forms, and it behooves you to employ variations on this theme whenever possible, because it increases your applied force, much like a machine of war.     2. Playing to Their Disadvantage; Similarly, the opposite strategem is to force the conflict into arenas where your opponnent has relative weaknesses, such as pressing a lanky opponent into a corner, or shifting the conflict with a generalist to a specific domain where you hold superiority, like commodity trading vs. money markets.   Perversely, stronger opponnents are better off with strategems within 2. Because their greater resource or skill allows them to force opponnents into unwise arenas more easily, with fewer risks. Weaker opponents are better off in 1. as evidenced by the success of forms like Guerrilla warfare, because weak opponnents cannot employ strategies which rely on the stronger opponent to take actions which may endanger the Stronger. The risk of forcing a move is often too costly for a weaker opponent to bear.  Context is important. A weaker boxer often plays strategem 2, because boxing is a fluid sport, where forcing moves is relatively simple. Whereas weaker economic powers almost always play 1. because economics moves relatively slowly, and interactions are weaker, making feints and leading motions more difficult to successfully complete.   Keep in mind that the proper application of the knowledge of conflict is to end it. No thinking being deserves suffering, and the most capable party is also the most responsible.

No.  Outlawpoet Daily is a way for me to muse online, and contains a lot of assumptions. An invisible audience is one of them, and I edit accordingly. I also add far more context than I find it neccesary to think about. And finally, sometimes I say or wonder about things that I dont' actually believe, as a method of exploration, or to expand a line of thought that I usually leave unturned.   Plus, I find it more useful to adopt multiple points of view for the purposes of my own edification.   So do not think my play indicates my true nature or opinion.

167668,878542,2002-10-07,"On being an artist   An artist, particularly a visual one, is something I am particularly proud of being. This is not a pride proportional to my talent, as a pride of achievement is, but a pride that is a little more involved. This may be because of my approach, and may be because I am dissatisfied with my current skill, but believe my progress is sufficient to reach a level satisfactory to such a pride. I am not certain.  Artistry, unfortunately, is usually approached in an intellectual manner with more pretension than skill, and certainly more holism than reductionism. Which leads to unbalanced big theories of artistry that center around the artist being a mutant genius afloat in a sea of experience among the morons and pharisees, inevitably.(If that sentence didn't resonate with you, you haven't read much art theory or worldview statements by artists)   The big issue with Art is communication. It's a transmissive medium, as I see it, and it's purpose is dirtied otherwise. The largest technical issue with making art, is icons, and your mind's predilectation for making them. For example, when you see a tree, rarely do you conciously explore it's details, edges, proportions, and colours. You rather, measure the tree in a basic and self-impactful way, and replace it in your map of the area with a simplified version based on your basic icon for a tree. Which is why when children start drawing, they invariably start with stick figures and similar. Their internal icons are very simple, and almost universal. Autistic children, lacking some higher-order integrative faculties, often are 'good' artists, because they sit and regurgitate details, forming complex pictures from memories. dwelling on details, rather than icons significant to themselves.  The problem is that our internal models rarely interact with other people or even ourselves. To combat being a bad artist in this way, you have two choices. You can force yourself to notice detail, proportion, and line, as a concious-level process, while you make art. This is a reciprocating process, where you duplicate detail, check your art, duplicate another detail, and so on. The other route, which almost all artists do, conciously or not, is to increase the detail level of your internal models of things you see. The more you do art, the more you will notice detail, until you hold your personal limit of visual detail without overloading your working memory. Very good artists often start with very complex internal visual models, others develop them through practice. Both approaches are valid, and both are usually pursued by artists, to varying degrees of reliance and skill. The mechanics of pen, brush, stylus, claymould, and blowtorch control are largely incidental and handled by specialized parts of your brain that everybody has anyway. Artistic talent is largely that of model complexity, and mental techniques for complexity management.   The really tricky bit is then taking the talent, and moving it to an art piece. This largely involves reverse-engineering the detail and line of the displayed object, and re-inserting your removed iconography and emotional subtext, without destroying the integrity of the picture, balancing detail and abstraction in an effort to both resonate and be recognized. The visual mediums have their own vocabulary, and it is within your choices as an artist, to determine which vocabularies you use. Realistic Art uses the terms and icons all are familiar with, objects and people, all close within normative reality, limiting the amount of icon work, and subtext you may insert. Abstract art often takes advantage of vocabularies not everyone has, limiting the potential audience, and how specific you can be, but allowing far more subtext and iconography to be inserted.  Artistic quality of a specific piece is a separate notion entirely, and rest on too many factors for me to lay bare. If I do get any closer to doing so personally, you'll be the first to know.    I've used iconography and several other words recklessly and outside their usual definitions, for this I apologise, and I promise I'm not a pretensetic artist with a tendency for neologisms, just a hapless prole at a librarium without a thesaral reference.",male,23,Technology,Leo,0
167669,878542,2002-10-01,"Given our current cognitive architecture, the level of self knowledge that is achievable depends a great deal on your awareness of that architecture. The structure and source of your mind/brain, is one of the central tenets of any philosophy of self that hopes to have any success in allowing real introspection. Understanding your biological basis is the first step to transcending it in a substantial way. (Yes, I did just use the word transcend, please do not misunderstand, This is not an endorsement of the emotional context that the concept of transcension finds itself in these days, it's just the only appropriate word. When your biological substrate is that of a social predator that's sole evolutionary purpose is to have complexly successful progeny, and lots of them, doing maths, and building houses,  can all be understood as transcending your design. Real Transcendence, manipulating your substrate, channeling and directing your evolutionary impulses, only comes with understanding, and effort. Unfortunately, we're not at a place where we can flip switches and get better. It takes real time to become aware of the processes of your mind, and move them closer to where you want to be.)  With that in mind, I'd like to discuss daily life. Daily, or moment to moment, is the way most people really experience life. Noble thoughts, and works of poetry can have great emotional impact, but ideas only alter a person, when they begin to intrude upon their actions and a decisions in a detailed way. The Ideas of Rationality, of the Scientific Method, of Altruism, and of Transhumanity, can have great emotional impact, but in many cases, I see it having little impact on daily life. People continue doing their jobs, and driving their cars, and may make plans to do things, but rarely get up the next day and alter. It may be that rationalist thought has a weakness, which prevents it from deeply affecting the majority of humans who encounter it. I'm tempted to say this is a weakness of the human design, that our cognitive architecture is too specialized towards our context and evolutionary environment to embrace rational ways of thinking.  But it is more likely that as a memetic trigger, the concept of rationalism has been missing something in it's presentation to most people.   A major, if informal objection to the way I think and formalize and act, is that it has little passion or inspiration. I invariably disagree, and say that I feel very strongly about the things I do and think. But the point is well-taken. I come across to people as dry or unfeeling so often, that there appears to be a pattern I am unable as of yet to correct for. I am not unfeeling. But communication is one of my claimed strengths, and I am evidently failing to communicate. It has it's roots, I think, in the emotional quality of poetry vs. Scientific Journalism. It is said, usually by proponents of emotional quality, that less is more. Perhaps it is the endless qualifications and adjunct specifications that kills the 'passion' of my positions. Or perhaps it's the bad formation. Usually, when I am writing or talking, the subject has a quality of exploration. Because I range so far afield, when I do spend time on a specifics, often, it's for the first time. So my speaking or writing is always littered with new ideas, expressed well or badly, or limpingly explored. Perhaps it is this quality that seems to make my rationalism passionless. Example: Richard Feynman, perhaps one of the best scientific authors I've ever read. His deep understanding of physics paradoxically allowed him to make some concepts absurdly simple, and easy to understand. His talks and writing are both full of excitement and passion, and almost always well thought out. Perhaps as a function then, understanding always progresses towards poetry, simple, exact, and emotional.   I'm not certain, but I don't it's quite that simple. It never is, in my experience. The truth is likely halfway between, that rationalist thought has never really been presented clearly, only being represented in human beings, whose understanding of it has been flawed and oppositional. And our poor evolved brain seems likely to defend against any incursion by concepts that are unrelated to reproductive fitness. Lucky and strange that such mishmashes of adaptations and instincts could  converge upon the tenet of rational thought. That doing the right things for the right reasons is more effective and powerful than any shortcut of knee-jerk reactions.

167671,878542,2002-11-06,"Less than three hundred years ago, the most powerful people in the world were monarchs and nobles, in Europe and Asia, who controlled what today would be billions of dollars in land, resources, buildings, and even people. These lucky few lived as the dreams of poorer men died around them, and they enjoyed power, prestige and the fulfillment of nearly every wish.  But despite their wealth, their power, and their position over others these men almost all died before their fiftieth year. Many did not know how to read, or the rules of simple mathematics. Few had seen more than one hundred square miles of the world, and none ever traveled faster than twenty miles an hour. Their wealth and position could not buy them what their society did not know, or had not yet achieved. A lower middle class individual in a industrialized nation in this year 2002 is comparitively more wealthy than the most fabulously rich king fifteen generations ago. Such an individual is afforded more choice in cuisine, a vastly superior education and medical care, more comfortable housing with temperature control, can travel around the world with sufficient preparation and saving, and communicate instantly with people around the world, though telephone and the internet. If this individual envies the past king's great mansion or many servants, they may save their wages for a year, and go check into a illustrious hotel or resort, where even Louis the Sun King would be flattered by bustling servants, beautiful artwork, and sumptious surroundings. Furthermore, our industrious vacationer can exchange one resort for another each year, experiencing new and more novel surroundings, and enriching each experience comparitively; though our king has his palace year round, it remains the same, and will for generations. And to heap insult upon this injurious comparison with the proud King, this man of 2002 will have nearly twice the good King's lifetime to enjoy all these advantages, and will remain healthy and well-heeled for most of his life.  While our King has great personal wealth, he lacks greatly in societal wealth: the relative commons of a society, it's technology, resources, and behavioral norms. Small inequalities in societal wealth can be made up in personal wealth, such as wealthy scions in impoverished nations today, who live quite well, even by American standards. But a great inequality in societal wealth provides our proverbial modern man with things a past King simply cannot have, and never will, thoughout the entirety of his short, if prestigious life.  Real wealth is capability, not resources. We measure men in dollars because in the short term, this determines what you can accomplish. But society changes and evolves, and in the longer consideration, the two are no longer the same.  To maximize your real wealth, a balance must be struck, between advancing your personal wealth, and contributing to societal wealth. Personal wealth provides you with comforts, luxuries, and increased capability. Societal wealth is the marketplace from which these things must be bought. If the marketplace is too poor, no amount of money will suffice to purchase what you desire. Conversely, the richest society in the world does you no good if you do not have sufficient coin to enter in.  Occasionally, the universe has a sale, and it is possible to buy a great deal of societal wealth with less effort than is usual. These moments ring down in history, because they are rich in advancement, and the opportunity for the creation of heroes and grand figures. Sixty years ago, a scientist invested less than 10 years of research and production, and saved future billions of lives, when he discovered a vaccine for the great scourge of polio, now almost unknown. Further in scientific history, a Dr. Nobel, sick at heart for his invention of nitro-glicerine which became TNT, offered up some of his uneasy wealth for the inspiration and reward of scientists who furthered humanity, indirectly contributing to some of the most influencial and beneficial accomplishments of humanity(including the aforementioned vaccine). Not only did these men do their neighbors a great service, they helped themselves by contributing to the society that surrounded them, affording themselves new abilities, and greater wealth.  The most critical point in history is always now, because in this fleeting moment, we have the opportunity to effect change, seize opportunities, and grow as individuals in ways that will never be available again. So, with this knowledge, know that there is no more pressing concern than to contribute to our societal wealth at this moment. Contributing to organizations and projects that advance the case of humanity allows you to increase your wealth, in ways that simply amassing more personal wealth does not. It helps you to build a world where your dollars are worth more. Where you can do things that you cannot do now, with any amount of money. Where you may live to enjoy these things longer.  There is no reliable way to calculate absolutely how much you invest in societal wealth, or what you will recieve in return. In this way it is very similar to business investing. Poor investment in charities,  medical technologies, or other contributions to those around you are not any better than investing in poor companies or employees. Finding the right way to contribute to the right causes is paramount in receiving a real and tangible return on your investment.  Archimedes is supposed to have said, ""But give me a lever and a place to stand, and I will move the world."". By contributing to efforts to better society, you change the place you live, exchanging it for an improved version, concurrently improving your own station. The accelerating change that our society undergoes ensures that this improvement does not long wait. One thousand dollars buys an ever more capable car or computer, flies you further in a better plane, buys you more competent medical treatment, cooks you safer and more varied foods.

167708,878542,2003-05-20,"Strangely, it seems that the more competent or knowledgable I become, the more hesitant I am about the subject. Certainly, over the last two years I've become vastly more uncertain about myself, my thoughts, my core competences. So what's the limiting case? Is total competence an absolute freezeup? Or is the trend hyperbolic?   I think that knowing more makes it more difficult to make decisions for good simple reasons in some cases, and vastly easier in others. The deciding environmental factor appears to be whether the decision regards a finite deterministic plan, or a creative unbounded one. Creative tasks actually get harder the more information you're trying to include. Engineering gets easier because your bag of preset tricks is larger.   So what's the solution? If competence leads to problems in creativity, and anticompetence leads to issues with design, is it simply a two directional tradeoff, with no shortcuts?   Well, things aren't that simple. But one good way to keep yourself from becoming too competent, is to learn in new areas. increasing your total bag of tricks, whilst making you magically a rank newbie in some area. This doesn't solve the underlying problem, but it helps psychologically to have something you can do.   Real creativity is of course, out of the picture for humans. We are neural creatures, and our 'creativity' consists of misapplying pattern to object. We can't generate from principles, or come up with de novo patterns effectively. Perhaps there is some way around this, but that is why more information retards our creativity. A more aptly designed intelligence would not have this problem, I suspect.   Real design is more likely, but it has problems. Because our scientific method are so primitive, we have very few really solved design problems, we have preferred solutions, but few things have been optimized to a point where re-use is the simplest and best option. So design becomes a creative endeavor on some levels. So it's difficult to seperate too much, and not enough information. See above.  Psychologically the problem becomes even more complex, because in order to design and create well, we need confidence, attitudal differential , a sense of place, certain environmental factors must be invariant, etc. Providing yourself with a good working state can be more difficult than the work itself, sometimes. Which is frustrating, exaberating the problem.  unfortunately, this is another one of those areas where a few million years of development would come in handy. If we had more history, we might have optimized strategies for dealing with situations like this. But we're a young species, so you'll just have to work it out on your own.

167716,878542,2003-06-21,"I worry and I worry, but the problems don't change.   For some time now I've been working on ways of making my situation more stable, more tractable, providing myself with some measure of security. I have put together some semblance of a company, which I expect to help me financially. I have provided myself with a meager education, to replace the entirely useless one I was force-fed by well-meaning public personages. I have come up with some tiny flashlight of a map into the surrounding world, getting some idea of who I am, where that is, and the limits and advantages thereof.   These whistlings in the dark don't  change  much, though. I remain in the same situation, and will remain much the same until further notice. That's not altogether a bad thing, I enjoy certain aspects of my position very much, as a human being, it would be hard not to. I am the perfect sort of mind to appreciate sunrises and beautiful women, good food, the joy of discovery. It is what I do, or can do. But some things are a part of my world that are not pretty. Natural, timeless, always things that I don't like, and can't accept. Changing those things (or planning to) distinguishes Transhumanists from most others. Humanists say that Man is the measure of all things. As well you should say, it's true, from at least this perspective. Transhumanists say the same, but not the same way. Man is not a static picture of values and states. You cannot learn all that there is of transhumanism from Cicero or even Roussau. Because we change, our world changes. Our minds change. I am a moving target. I know more today than yesterday, am different from the Justin that woke up. I am a stream of Justins, each different from the last, I would like to think each better than the last. I cling to that belief. That I do more with less neurons, less time, less speed. It would be a mistake to judge me by my younger self, just as it is to use a frozen vew of men to judge them all. Transhumanism is about changing values and evaluators. Nothing is a given. Nothing is accepted.   It may be that this is a colder universe than the warm timeworn humanism. It's filled with mistakes and tragedy and wasted lives. You cannot explain death or disease away as man's lot. You begin to see alternatives, like a man who sleeps in a clean house, and cannot stand to return to a hovel. For some time after I encountered transhumanists, I was a wreck, with emotions sandpapered down to bare nerves. I would cry for hours at things I accepted before. I began to care for minor characters in stories nonfictional and fiction. Sometimes I still do. Every loss is keener in a worldview so expanded. When something might be saved, you regret not doing so.   Objectively, it seems that that raising of my horizons is a great positive act, bringing untold possiblities and joys within reach of my imaginitation. I have no doubt that it is so. Subjectively, it feels like falling a great distance. Your situation is geometrically less of the best possible world. It makes even the best and most powerful plans seem weak and small.   My thoughts these past two years are some of the most ambitious I've ever had. Some of the best and most detailed too. They have all been fatally flawed, with mistakes I find obvious and stupid, sometimes only a few days of learning later. This is progress. I am better positioned now, than I have been in my life. Even fatefully flawed, my plans and ideas have carried me far, much further than if I had not recognized their shortcomings, in fact.  But it bothers me, it eats at me still. My plans are not good enough. They fall very short of the vaulted ceiling that is my desires. Very short of my imaginary best of all possible worlds. Once, in search of some surcease from sorrow, I built a best case scenario. Assuming  assuming  a modest budget of some several billion dollars available to me, and the cooperation of a small crew of some thousands I could not ensure my success. There were too many variables. I had to settle for a good path some distance from the best of all possible worlds. It taught me that power is little without adequate direction. It is the specific knowledges and details that is so difficult about creating the future. It's the plans that take the most effort.",male,23,Technology,Leo,0

167722,878542,2003-08-27,"On love.   It's come to my attention recently that a lot of people have dubious opinions of romance.  To these people I say that romance is an enduring thing. People keep and inflate what is important to them, and so romance grows. People investigate and practive what is interesting to them, and so romance grows more skillful. And people make mistakes and so romance grows more thoughtful.   Romance is both a function of biological imperatives and information theory. Suppose you have an intelligence, who looks around, and tries to figure out why things act the way they do. And suppose there is another intelligence who does the same thing. What do you think will happen? They begin to pay attention to each other. As intelligences they are some of the complex AND unpredictable behavior in their local environment. And as they learn, they become more complex. Becoming more complex forces the other intelligence to try harder to understand, growing itself. And so these two happily spend ever increasing proportions of their time on each other, growing and learning. A simple story, of love? Love is the story of two people growing together, but it seems like more than that. But weakly, already we begin to see a basis for fascination with other within even simple expressions of people.   Love is not an emergent thing, but it is something that has great basis in our identity as thinking beings, and as such, it will endure so long as that remains so.  Love is important to people now for a wild variety of reasons, the greatest of which is emotional. But important and beautiful things are preserved, even through great change. So we can expect love to outlast our simple emotions in some form or another. As we grow up, we only lose those things we no longer want or need.",male,23,Technology,Leo,0

My limbic system is still roiling from losing a girlfriend of two years, so the last two weeks have been a little sub-optimal. But work continues in saving the world.

Unfortunately due to some negative reader experience and other factors, it's not available online despite my usual views that more information is better.

People ask me, if I'm not an altruist, why I care or spend time on improving the lot of others.  So, let's suppose you're a member of a fairly specific population, say, legally blind people who live independently in the US. Now, individually, these people may not be very similar to each other, but their situation makes them a specific and known population. You're one of these people, and you note that legislation is about to go through that will legally restrict the activities legally blind people can embark on unaided. You obviously grab your stuff and try and stop this legislation. Why? The primary beneficiaries, in and ultimate sense, will not be you, but other people.

That's the logical justification, in a crude sense, of my efforts to help people out. Improvements to the group that I belong to(humanity) are improvements to my situation. My fate is for better or for worse inextricably entangled with the present and future of humanity. We're interdependent, and very very fragile. So to survive, I must view myself as a part of a larger situation. And every little bit helps.   Now, this is all very good, but it's obviously not the  initial  reason I help people. I am not a rational person yet, and I dont' plan all my actions to my full predictive horizon. I am not an altruist, in an ultimate sense, because I don't feel I need to help people. But sometimes I want to. Becuase I was born into a horrific situation. Lots of people die every day, lots of people are involuntarily subjected to things every day, craploads of complexity is lost every day, wonderful novels go unwritted every day because their possible author is starving or working for food, or being beaten or shot at. This is a situation that demands rectification, even from relatively uninterested bystanders, much less orphans born in the middle of the war zone.  It is entirely likely that after a successful uplift of humanity, I won't spend much time helping people out or crusading for good causes. Well, maybe, but habits die hard. And child abuse is known to instill certain repetitive behaviors in human-like minds.   So, I may not be a philosophical altruist, but I help people anyway. You can take your simple characterizations and shove them. Pragmatism may not be a pretty philosophy, but sometimes it leads to nice morally uplifting results, particularly when pragmatism is at best a weak characterization of tiny differences from human standard, rather than some big ivory formal system that outputs actions. But you already knew that.  I am a pragmatist because it works. Much like I'm a rationalist because I get better results from it. They also seem to conform to a pattern of relationships I've come to associate with 'truth'.  A pattern, I hasten to add, that I'm not very good at recognizing yet, but I try.   Anyway, that question aside, My work this year has been very private, which bothers me. Privacy concentrates productivity into a single point of failure, much as I hate to view myself as a risk. So little outlets like this blog, or my chatting on IRC, or emails to other people help me keep my privacy to a managable level. But of course, it's not enough. What I would really like is to be in a position where privacy was not an option.  Unfortunately, given my position, so far it's the only option. So  that's probably what I'll be doing the end of this year. Working on ways for my side-projects to be less private. That means, hopefully, some of my CAD designs will be going online permenantly, rather than just emailed to people. As well as some theses and other wonderful stuff.

This movie is a particularly bad example with warring 'species' which consist of basically small, tribe size groups trying to exterminate each other over percieved slights, and mutual claimed territory. It gets worse when the story starts to 'justify' the conflicts between them, with one side (invariably the one the heroes are on) turning out to be 'in the right' and the other side being revealed as unspeakably evil.

I still have no real explanation for the preponderance of skinny starved chicks in action movies, or even movies in general.   I blame the fashion industry. My theory is that gay male fashion designers pick models without blatant feminine features (ie, the skinny, breast/hipless, heroin chic girls like kate moss), and also pick bland, uninteresting poles to focus attention on their clothing styles. These two dynamics combine with the image driven and derivative nature of entertainment industries to support themselves, and spawn to different contexts, like TV and movies.    this is of course, a profoundly flawed theory that has little to do with reality, but it makes me feel better to think there is a reason all these unattractive and ineffectual girls get parts in movies that should know better.   That being said, Kill Bill seems a little better than most. But that's not saying much.

167735,878542,2003-09-03,"urlLink I, Cringely | The Pulpit   A great deal of backbiting has always plagued the world striding colossus that is Microsoft. From the very beginning, people have disliked MS' approach, from their purchasing of MSDOS to their blatant Macintosh emulation. And as the internet changes and surges into new areas, Microsoft seems determined to grasp it's  mode of operation and force the internet into it.   The internet and it's quick market reaction may be the only reason Microsoft is still around. The sensitive barometer of software development builds tools for what people use, because otherwise software initiatives die. Even the strange and unique world of open-source development builds windows binaries often as not. This continuiing reaction to the user base has giving microsoft a continuing validation by forces that might rather it die a quick death.   And this is a good thing. Regardless of philosophical differences, I believe that total progress is the goal. And Microsoft still has something to offer us. It's massive budget and scare-mongering tactics may earn it the ire of many, but it also spends money like a wino on french holiday trying to grow the computer market. And the computer market should be grown. It's too useful of a tool to remain the province of the rich and geeky. So it helps us. But it's also a huge corporation that in the end has only legal and pricing considerations. So it doesn't act in what we can call a moral manner. But neither does any other large corporation. They can't afford to, and it's not their job. Accountants aren't paid to be moral, lawyers aren't paid to be moral, and all the others in MS are simply there to do a job. They do their job, and the end result is immoral behavior. Where does the buck stop? Arguably the owners of microsoft are not doing a job, and can be expected to support moral behavior. But the simple fact is that corporate ownership is seen as a form of investment, so it is in fact a special kind of job. another one whose only requirement is return on said investment.   So perhaps expecting moral behavior is too much from a large corporation. There is, as we have found, no single agent that can impart a moral sense to their actions. This is not a very good state of events, but it's what we have. I would hope that Microsoft either acknowledges this fact, or rectifies it. Or dies a quick death. It's not to my advantage to have immoral actors around.",male,23,Technology,Leo,0
167736,878542,2003-09-03,"urlLink Haystack Home   It is an occasionally useful maxim of mine that standardization cuts two ways. It decreases variety and increases volume, almost without exception. The sometimes counter-intuitive result of standardization is an increase in human variety. The development of TCP/IP vastly reduced the kinds of interaction between computers while simultaneously multiplying the amount of information exchanged. Humans used this new volume for a dizzing array of webpages, services, games and most importantly organization of these kinds of information. Search engines are webpages, but in certain ways, they are above them. You go to webpages for specific content, even if of a dynamic kind. Search engines are fundamentally different, and belong in a different kind of category. services like finger and ssh are similar. They provide information about other services, or provide increased levels of interopability. They transcend simple transaction, but operate on the same mechanical level.   These specialized kinds of variety all operate on a single level from the standpoint of the computer, packets of information with particular addressing and content. This similarity allows the computer to transmit with impunity the great array of ideosyncratic creations that we call the internet. The key is that the standardization exists on a transparent level to the computer. If the english language or picture color balance were standardized, little increased volume would result. Because a computer lacks the ability to take advantage of the regularities in such standardization. Without extra potential volume, little new variety would result, and the standardization process would be a useless venture, from the standpoint of computers. Teaching english and photography may be easier in that hypothetical case.   If software was several orders of magnitude smarter, regularities in english and picture color balance, might be tractable to increased natural language parsing, and intelligent search of photos.  But I digress.  The key is to provide increased potential usable volume by reducing underlying complexity up to the point of transparency. the encroaching standardization can never get in the way of human variety. This key point explains why standards that work with TCP/IP work up to a point. html, XML, dynamic content, standard port addresses, IPv6, these are all good things and useful to many people. But technologies like  OS specific net connectivity, social exchange technologies, and even tiny simple things like standard quoting rules in forums and email lists fail miserably or just lead to balkinization.   But standards on the edge of human variety and machine parsibility is where the exciting ideas are. The question of which side of the line a technology falls under is an open question that often depends on effort, cleverness and popular interest. A wonderful example is the above 'success story' of XML. XML is another child of a larger technology called SGML. This miserably complex, highly disordered description framework had hundreds of interpretations which were almost entirely opaque to one another. But the central concept was such a good one that clever folks were compelled to snip usable portions of it into nice sub technologies that enjoyed much more success, like html, certain vector graphics formats, and document description frameworks. Enter some years later, faster computers, more complex software environment. XML, a specification that's nearly as powerful as SGML, and in many ways just as opaque is a runaway success. The line of machine-useful information is higher, and the human variety imparted to XML applications is truly stunning. Almost all SGML applications are now ported to XML(affirming their equivalency, though XML has a much greater ease-of use and cleverness factor). The difference is very slight, but enough for the differential of widely used and deprecated.   The moving line of standardization vs. human variety has reached new heights with the advent of complex software and UIs that reach into complimentary arenas and make available the unions to their users. The above link is a software project that may or may not succeed, but shows the approximate position of what kinds of information may be succeptable to machine organization for human benefit.   I was surprised by the possiblities and the sheer pleasure of interacting with a UI like this. It's pleasant surprises and steady advances that make me hopeful for informational technology like this. None of the underlying technologies are new. IMs, Emails, websites, text searching. But treating these superficially different services as a standardized commodity brings new potential USABLE volume to the table. It's theoretically possible to have infinite webpages, but only a small finite amount are useful. technologies like google and haystack bring that usable amount much higher, and haystack links that usable volume to other usable volumes, like private correspondence and personal data. The resulting human variety from this standardization may be used for... well, whatever you want to use it for :-)",male,23,Technology,Leo,0

167740,878542,2003-10-06,"Neon Genesis Evangelion.  Yes, ph34r.   This is an anime, for those who haven't cringed in terror already. The premise of the anime is largely that there are two kinds of people, those weak, confused, gullible and insane/self-loathing, and/or those who build labrynthine plots to exploit the former in mysterious and seemingly counter-productive ways.  Confused at that last sentence? The tangled participles and fragments are a tiny candle against the horrifying bonfire of continuity errors and irrationalities this anime will introduce to you.  Your main character is Shinji a lovable young boy, who... Well, we love him for no apparent reason, it's a given. And he doesn't really do anything. In fact, upon reflection, he doesn't do a single thing he isn't guilted or forced into by aforementioned plotters and such. But, um, he's a very sympathetic character! See, he is very emotional. These emotions seem to have no basis in reality, or the events that occur to him, and vary wildly in strength in no relationship to external stimuli. He is essentially a non-character, who reacts randomly. Roll 1d6, 1-3, guilty and useless; 4, angry and useless; 5 insane and useful; 6 nearly catatonic and/or happy.  That's pretty much it for shinji. Basically his role is to soak up abuse. We're not supposed to notice that his gross incompetence and self-destructive tendencies only let him act when it's either harmful to him, or necessary to preserve the existence of the very world that the anime exists upon. And even the latter isn't always a given.   Shinji, sadly enough is an apt analogy for the audience of this anime. We're either dumb or don't know better, and keep bashing ourselves over the head with more episodes in ill-aimed enthusiasm, or because we're hoping against hope that things will make sense in the end. Both Shinji and anime enthusiasts could stand to learn to pattern match better.   The shape of the overall series follows the same shape as the individual episodes. Occasional stunning visual treats boxed in by an author's pathological desire to twist, misquote, and bastardize mythology, religion, history, techno-babble, and conspiracy theory into some not quite revealed labrynthine plot that never quite gets off the ground. We learn a bit about the characters, and reinforce the initial stereotypes they were shoved into. No growth really occurs, except in exceptional cases, such as those character lucky enough to die before the end of the series.   If you're thinking of watching this series for the first time, don't. Instead, just watch the penultimate dvd offering ""Death and Rebirth"". It minimizes the annoying mythological/religious name-dropping, as most of the beginning is a visual/thematic overview of the more legible plot points thus far. It also stars Kaoru Nagisa in a wonderful speaking role that is so lucid and easy to understand that I'm convinced a rogue animator inserted it after the author had ran screaming into the night during post-production. You get a decent idea of what the series is about while not having to actually slog though it. Also, ""Rebirth"" takes basically the most interesting and legible section of the ""End of Evangelion"", cutting off all the hallucinogenic and toxic crap at the end. Still, ""Death and Rebirth"" is a little on the long side, and adjust your glasses, unless you know japanese. The English cast in the DVD edition is pretty okay, and they've done a lot of work on translation and paraphrase. In some cases inserting meaning where there was none before. But nothing quite gets you there as watching Shinji cringe, Rei vamp, and Gendo not explain a damn thing in their native language.   There is a certain perverse joy in playing connect the dots in Evangelion. Identifying which myth or religious concept the author has totally ripped off and fucked out of recognizability is a never ending job. Similarly, it's fun to see how we're supposed to care about these stupid blind gullible characters, and dislike these cold, aloof psychopaths that we never learn anything about. And identifying the mixing between the two. Occassionally a puller of strings becomes a victim, or a victim is revealed to have their own ill-advised schemes behind the scenes. But in the end it's difficult to have any emotions but those that are pounded into you by the jackhammer of visual agony. The real strength of this anime is it's art. And ""Death and Rebirth"" seems to realize that. Shunning some dialog for visuals and atmosphere building. They still yap incessantly about things that don't make sense, but it's better than the others, trust me.   This is probably worth seeing, if only for the few interesting ideas and great great scenes to watch. The artists' conception of Tokyo3 is unique insofar as I am aware, and quite spell-binding in certain situations. The art is subtle, gross, exciting, and big big big. Giant Robots have never been so personable or scary.   So, for those who have seen this anime, specifically ""Death and Rebirth"" you notice how Kaoru keeps calling humans the 'lillin'? an apellation later confirmed by scenes in Central Dogma in ""End of Evangelion"".  Of course, all you at home are familiar with the story of Lillith, right? The first wife of Adam who rejected him, and left the garden of Eden because he would not treat her as an equal? Yeah, so ignoring the biblical problems with our descent from such a person, I'll not that in classical theory, the only person Lillith is known to have messed around with other than Adam is the Adversary(that's Satan, in poorly transliterated phonetic hebrew). Implications? Other than problems with the holy generations listed in the bible, it implies that humans are not infact the creations of god. We're the children of the first rebels against him. And it's not clear exactly what happened to the original mankind, if we supplanted them. Luckily, the author of Evangelion is not tracking dependencies or consequences on any level, so we dont' have to worry about the actual implications of any of the ideas in these episodes. But the strange thing is that the insanity of the author actually sparks thought amongst his disbelieving and horrified audiences. Perhaps the ideas that fly off him, poorly executed though they may be, are original enough and novel enough to be worth absorbing and considering. And all things considered, I would much rather be the spawn of the Morningstar than a child of that tool Abraham.   I know what you're thinking, Lucifer = bad. But do that math people. the Morningstar was God's most powerful creation. His most beautiful, intelligent, and loving child. But Lucifer wanted to bring the Knowledge of good and evil, as well as the Fruit of Life unto men, whose lives where short, and vision clouded. But that cut in on God's franchise, so he smote his former most beloved child into a cursed creature. And never ever did Morningstar relent, nor shall he ever, according to the Talmud and bible. So here we have the most intelligent, powerful, loving, beautiful being in the whole universe, cursed throughout all eternity for our sakes. Championing Consideration, Knowledge, and Eternal Life is not the best way to earn God's trust. The choice between the two seems simple.   Hmm, back to the anime.   This anime is wierd, and confusing. Don't watch the whole thing looking for answers, more details merely give you more points to quibble over and memorize. ""Death and Rebirth"" sad as it is, is pretty much the clearest the series ever gets.  And it has the best action. The visual of a tiny boy floating in mid air, hands in pockets, sneakers bobbin up and down, as giant fucking robots fight to stop him from destroying the world is one I will not forget. Watch it.  Then go watch a sports anime, like Hikaru No Go, or Hajime no Ippo. And luxuriate in the clear plot and semi-realistic characters. Then go pump your head, and never ever look at a pre-teen in 'ho clothes again.  You antisocial pedophile.",male,23,Technology,Leo,0
167741,878542,2003-10-06,"Insufferable.   As time goes on, and things develop further, I am constantly struck by the perversity and short-sightedness of human cultural design. More and more, I am of the opinion that humans actually lie beneath the critereon of sapient beings. The level that unthinking reaction and habit tend to affect all levels of human endeavor seems to bespeak of a mental design more opportunistic than exploratory, and more exploitative than creative.   The fault is internal to humans, I must assume. There are enough theoretical societies and structures without the horrid irregularities around us that I must hope at least one of them is viable, minus the strange predilectations we have as humans towards social situations.   Mental landscapes are so poorly integrated that one often finds mutually contradictory goals held within the same person, and a single course of action can have wildly divergent inspirations and content amongst a simple population of supposed co-operatives. The simple amount of contradictory actions people take despite avowed beliefs or goals makes one reconsider whether or not we're accurately classified as individuals at all.   I find the most galling evidence within myself, as the exemplar of humanity most amenable to examination. My attempts to resolve the inconsistencies have met with failure. My attempt to mitigate them remains a mixed success. The ultimate irony may lie within the particular opportunistic nature of evolution. Intelligence is an advantage, to a genotype. But it remains a genotype first, and intelligence second. Did any short steps towards rationality and clarity die quick unreproductive deaths during the rapid rise of intelligence in the hominid line? We may be leashed 'intentionally' inasmuch as such a term can apply to a blind process. Intelligence is all well and good, the evolutionary record might say. But when it threatens productivity within a genotype, it won't last long. So the intelligences that outcompeted the others are leashed, as it were, to impulses and desires that ensure success. That turn intelligence into a tool of the underlying goals.   Such things are badly integrated, blind impulse and instinct being poor doorwardens for intellect. We happily continue having sex, with contraceptions in place. We retain our lust for social status, when such prizes no longer guarentee simply best selection in mates and food, but more subtle authorities and responsibilities.   The impulses remain, and do provide for portions of what we like to call our personalities.  But often they remain independent of our thoughts and goals. We ascribe great mystery to them, because they must indeed be powerful to move us so greatly. This is the largest reason for over-estimation of the role of 'emotions' and irrational processes.   In an interesting way, such emotions and drives and instincts can be thought of as group characteristics. They are the overarching similarities that keep us so similar to each other. They are better understood as environmental variables, however, seperate from the private, learned and grown portions of ourselves that makes us unique. Everyone has emotions, and they all react largely the same way, when they can be isolated. More interesting and individual are those opinions, dreams, and desires most removed from the common human experience. The real part of the person, you might say.  The part that wasn't built in by blind chance and heredity, right?   No. This isn't what I think. But it's an easy, and strangely romantic way of looking at things. There is no easy way to seperate any portion of the human mental landscape, no pure intellect chained to the meat and evolutionary baggage of our forefathers. But it's a viewpoint that shows up distressingly often in the world of transhumanists, intellectuals, and navel-gazers of the new scientific bent. It's a simplistic solution that appeals greatly to those who wish to transcend personal weakness and hardship by 'unlinking' some percieved dead weight. The truth is never that easy. You can't have a human minus his hormones and have a human unchanged. You are left with a dead human. Nonfunction. There is no simple essence to intelligence. We (personally) are our fears and eyes, and legs and limbic reactions. There can't be a separations that way.  Growing up isn't that easy.",male,23,Technology,Leo,0

If the boundaries to entry were higher, we might see more funding and research in it. Sadly, 'real scientists' rarely have time to experiment with things within the reach of common man. Even though a proper IEC device would need to be enormous to reach the break-even point, the fact that small versions can be built by ordinary mortals may have poisoned the concept for serious investigation. It is similar to the great gulf that exists between commercial aerospace and amateur designs. You have essentially Estes rockets, large Estes rockets, custom large Estes rockets, and then a great gulf of nothing, until the large expensive commercial, government and military launch vehicles. Little research gets done on the gulf between them, and no bridging technologies are created. Some of this is being rectified, by the relatively new Xprize efforts, and new entities like SeaLaunch, but it's still very stratified. And uptake of new technologies is minimal. Anything from the amateur end is badly integrated, and deemed useless. Anything from the government end is so expensive and mired in existing systems, it never achieves a useful genericity.  But, I suppose there are vested interests in making developed technology seem arcane and complex, to justify research expenditures. And amateurs are hard pressed to develop general technologies.   Were I an idealist, I would say that the amateurs will be the ones to close the gap. As open-source internet communities spread from software to hardware, they'll embrace and extend out to large scale technological development.   But the scaling between a software project and something with a few hundred thousand moving parts, and spanning several scientific and/or engineering disciplines is daunting.   And amateurs seem far better suited to immerse themselves in psuedoscientific stupors, building and rebuilding half-imagined perpetual motion machines, antigravity generators, and historical replicas. Interesting that lots of people in this vein seem to refer back to the research of Nikolai Tesla. I've become increasingly of the opinion that he's become even more of a personage of borrowed authority than Einstein and Galileo, these days. There's no easier path to renegade science respectability than conjuring an analogy between your downtrodden theories and Tesla's mad and fantastic electronic designs.   If I see one more design based on a fundamental misunderstanding of angular momentum involving magnets or electricity, I may give up entirely.   I'm of the opinion that some sort of organized effort would be necessary. Some forceful extension of amateur science into the realm of real exploratory research. Sadly(or happily) our social and technological situation is hardly stable, and things continue to change rapidly. So such a movement may occur or be obsoleted without much forewarning.",male,23,Technology,Leo,0

I have seen great cities, unknown, rising from the plain growing new before my eyes. Towers and spires, none the same telling a tale of lives I cannot follow.  I have woken to dawn, fading visions into memories I curse, hating them for hints of loss. Wanting to wake again, back back where loss is memory.  There are no roads back no paths to follow only failing memory. Only fading hopes.  I have lived great triumphs, victories without war, friends I never lose. My influence spread gently, designs and ideas accepted, my plans writ large upon the world.  Plans and triumphs that grow live, dance, and change. Giving me great surprise, children grown beyond intent. Joy and Satisfaction.  I have seen my plans of triumph fade obsoleted, grown past. My memories of them poisoned by new eyes, seeking every flaw. Nothing left but hints marking old mistakes.  These things I remember  like glances of stories too fast and light to hold them, only scents of their meaning left.  I curse my memory in both directions.  I cannot hold my past self fast the younger man who dreamed great things the details slip and splotch even two days past I struggle to contain the tiny pieces of my lost dreams. I cannot quite lie that nothing of me dies with them.  But these memories burn me. Better to be nothing,  than remember enough to regret, than to feel enough to weep for loss. I would rip past days from me deny my past, forget my dreams to live in peace  free of comparison.  Both paths are denied. I lose myself in fading memories, my past dreams and old hopes tatter and are gone. Left are memories of memories just holes that held something, their shapes hinting at the loss, the blackness there telling me  telling me I too am gone, in measure. Yesterday's dreamer is dead. I am all that remain.  So today too, I will dream. I will dream great dreams, I will see great cities, I will live great triumphs, and I will remember them,  failingly, haltingly, in tattered record to pass them to tomorrow. So he too will despair, and he too will worry that something of who he was  lives in those fading things.  There  is  another hope another dream.  It does not visit me in visions. but lies above them. Today I am upon a hill I climbed part of it yesterday tomorrow I will climb another. And I must dream, must hope each hill brings me closer  to where it comes from.  That each day's dying and each day's steps trace a direction a path of lives and plans that points to a man some day some when a man wearing something like my face with something like my name who carries some dim piece of  me  a man who needs not fear memory who fears no dream of fairer places. a man who has come home.",male,23,Technology,Leo,0

167749,878542,2003-11-04,"You know, if you look long and hard enough for an answer, almost anything begins to look like wisdom.  I suppose this effect is easy to see, from a certain perspective. Constant sameness of any kind dulls your perceptions, and the absence of an answer grates on your intuitions. You begin to look beyond your original assumptions for satisfaction. It is perhaps like a failed relationship, as the unsatisfied partner's eyes begin to wander outside their original scope.  That is too apt an analogy, too easy. Also, both images wound me. Too much identification.   You know, not that long ago, I would have said that there is no such thing as a comforting lie. That the truth is preferable to anything else, under all circumstances, even from an emotional standpoint. I'm not certain that it's not, but I've come much closer to considering it. Sometimes the truth can tax my enthusiasm for being right.   There is a small list now, of things I'd almost rather not know. Sometimes I wish for some confusing information, just so I'd have to reevaluate my current best guesses about the world. A good hallucination, or improbable event. A thermodynamic miracle, a coffee cup leaping back together.   But intelligence eventually imparts one with a flawed but functional intuition as to the shape of reality. A kind of reflexive recognition of the character of truth. It gets to the point where you begin seeing similar imprints at the bottom of each story. Not that this doesn't present it's own problems. Recognizing truth in this manner has the same kinds of hazards. False positives are just as, or more dangerous. Sometimes the old plodding way of confirming reality is still the safest.  But intuitions of this nature allow interesting conclusions to be drawn. What if there is a certain design similarity between all truths? Would this be real physics? Real math? A mysterious teleological uncaused Cause? No, I don't' think so. But I'm hardly qualified to make an educated guess. Or even a wild speculative guess. It seems like any such similarity is because of reality, rather than the cause of it. But it's difficult the separate the two possibilities.   Maybe I'm just frustrated. A year of little discernible accomplishment IRL. Great strides in my understanding do little to mollify a personality that I built of ambition and personal accomplishment. Learning feels like no great thing, because previously, all learning was easy, a non-subject. I could learn whatever I pointed myself at. Now, I'm either decaying or aiming at targets much higher than before. I prefer and assume the latter. The former is a haunting possibility. I wish, not for the first time, for a return to earlier days. A letter to send to my younger self. ""Concentrate here instead"". Maybe more time, practice or neural plasticity would result in what I lack thus far. A breakthrough of some kind. A result.   Perhaps my expectation of a result is in itself misguided. I have long noted the anthropomorphic expectation that all important discoveries fit within a simplifying abstraction that in turn fits neatly within human short term memory. Perhaps greatly powerful heuristics lie just outside easily manipulated formulae sizes. There is no way to know for sure. But there is no reason to assume the answers lie outside human ability. The complexity barrier has yet to begin to rear it's ugly head. At least practically. Already, we have hit limits in theoretical knowledge in math. How many other areas conceal such nasty surprises?   I don't like to think about such things. They're unsettling and hard to resolve, emotionally. They remind me of another sore spot, my poor memory. Oh, culturally relative I have a great memory, but in general, a horrible one. I can barely remember my own thoughts of a mere hour ago. My personality of a year ago is assuredly not preserved in full. For someone still gripped by a sense of mortality and self, there is no more horrifying realization than the fact that a few years from today, only the grossest approximation of myself today will still exist. Not even in my own memory will I be fairly represented. I will always be filtered through my future self, and imperfect recollection.   You know, some time ago, my journals and notes of most of my past life before 2001 were lost to me. I can't describe the sense of loss inherent in that. My poor memory seemed more secure with physical hooks to goad it into accuracy. Now whatever I did, or accomplished or began lives just as I remember it today. And even that poor testament will degrade as time passes. Justins past fade into reinterpreted mist.  This is not all sad. Much deserves to be forgotten. But I wont' get to choose which is and isn't. I already remember unpleasant social events more vividly than my first kiss, my first book, my first love. I can't remember the first time I understood rationalism. The first time I proved a math.   For a while, I was paralyzed in fear of losing my notes again. And then, after a while I was afraid to take notes. What was the point? I rarely reviewed them after a week or so. And I would lose them again. For the first time in a while, computers became less interesting to me. Most of my childhood and young adulthood I considered them tools primarily for writing. An impression I only recently began to change. I was stymied. I couldn't rely on them anymore.  Gradually I began to realize that this was no different than anything else. I can't place sole trust in anything.   These aren't bad realizations. They are useful, to me. But this post has grown, and reading over it, I find little that could be useful to a reader. Little even useful to me. It has little structure, little predictive value. It wanders, and it makes no great conclusion.   I find I am afraid of change, even as I work towards it. I'm afraid of a lot of things. But fear doesn't motivate me as much as desire. Though I do fear that balance reflects nothing so much as genes and environment. I don't know how many thoughts I have that can be described that way. I just have to test each one as much as I can think to, I suppose.   One's optimism or pessimism can be determined by who you want to be, over who you are. And whether the differential is larger or smaller than your ambition and hope. That relationship will be different tomorrow. And I'm not sure what the answer even is today. I guess I can approximate based on whether I think that is encouraging or not.   Today someone accused me of being unscientific. I was surprised how much it stung, particularly given the medium, (just IRC) and the source (some person I don't know, and who doesn't know me). the fact that anyone would get such an impression reflects badly on me, I think. But I can't say they're entirely wrong. I am unscientific, I am irrational. I'm far too emotive, and I'm unstable in several dimensions. Further, I am of limited value in certain endeavors. But I aspire not to be. And that my efforts in this were unrecognized, hurts me. Even from one with little vision. I would like to think that I appear to be trying, at least. But perhaps this is too much to ask from outside opinion. Or perhaps I'm overrating myself.   I like asking a lot of questions.

I had to attend a memorial service, for my friend Dorothy.   Dorothy was a friend of the family for almost as long as I can remember. I spent a lot of time at their house, and talking to them. When Al (her husband) died some time ago, Dorothy kind of started to fade. Prior to this it was difficult to believe she had been born in 1906. She and Al were very vibrant folk, who traveled, kept up extensive property, and maintained many friends and volunteer positions. She began to show her age after the death of Al, but continued her work in local groups and friends. A local cat strayed into her house one day, and never left, she perked up a great deal after that. Sadly, this year the cat died of diabetes. Dorothy fell ill soon after, and died. The service was very nice. I will miss them both very much.   Dorothy and Al were the oldest people I knew, though I rarely thought of them this way. some people, even as young as sixty often seemed far older, weakened, unclear, pathetic. Al was maintaining his paths and property up to his death, and Dorothy was a great communicator with an excellent memory and storytelling facility, even in the hospital.   She liked to brag about her age. She once approached an ancient piano player in a restaurant to see how old he was, and informed him he had twenty years to go before he was old. She described her life as a bridge between horses and spaceships.   Al told me once that when he was a boy, children dreamed of going as far away as europe. When he was fifty, they dreamed of going to the moon. And when I was a child, in the twighlight of his life,  they dreamed of going to europe.  He wasn't sure what happened, but he felt that we as people were waiting for something to change, so our dreams could grow again. He wanted to see that change. Dorothy was very religious, and had her answer. But he was unsure what exactly was missing. He died wondering. She now has followed him.   Ninety-six years were not enough. She felt she had more to do, more to see, and more to experience. Despite living in the most tumultous times we have ever known, they never seemed to fear for the future. Perhaps it was my childish perception, but they seemed to grow with their age, while many adults had diminished. They seemed capable and wise, even during my teen years, when I was learning the most about frailties and mistakes, and was at my most suspicious.   Dorothy had a face-life when she was seventy, which was a daring time, even for younger, more tolerant cultures. Cosmetic surgery really has become far more acceptable as time goes on, but it was a process she never failed to recommend, but not ""until you really need it"" after ""about sixty-five"". She remained a terrible flirt, and would embarass waiters, male friends, and a certain sensitive teen with equal abandon. Dorothy and Al were the first adults I saw kissing with passion(in person, anyway).   Dorothy was particularly active in the International Society of the Kings Daughters and Sons. She even wrote a book about their history, up to 1970.   They leave behind a beautiful home north of San Francisco, with it's intricately maintained paths and trees and gardens. Sadly, the land has already been diminished by development, and will likely be sold for new housing. It was once eight acres of nature and path, which was quite something at it's inception, and had only become more so throughout the years.   To Dorothy Ellison, a good friend.

I capitalize words less, write more clearly. I have  clear standards for what works and what doesn't on this format. I don't think I have many readers, and that's not the point. This isn't a cry for attention or a newsblog. It's me, Corwin, Outlawpoet, Justin. My life, my thoughts and my history. If you're interested, you can read. But if you don't, I'll keep writing.   I'm looking at my new watch, and I think I'll get some sleep. I hope that this blog lasts a long time and that I get to laugh at the idea that two years could be a long time.",male,23,Technology,Leo,0

167767,878542,2004-01-21,"urlLink The Onion | Study Reveals: Babies Are Stupid   Developmental Psychology strides forward once again.  I'm back, from my amazing tour of the city known as Los Angeles. The folk at a2i2 were very kind interesting people, whom I had lots of fun meeting and talking to. Micheal, Richard, Bela', and Peter were very accomodating and I look forward to my collaboration with them in the future. Also, the other applicants, Jeff, and Owen were fun to talk to, and I hope that I may be able to meet or work with them in the future.   In the course of the weekend, I was introduced to their methodology and some of the test environments they work with. It's very interesting and detailed work, and I had to work pretty hard to keep up and ask intelligent questions. I was very impressed with what I saw, in terms of integration, and development. I'm quite confident that they are taking very secure and well researched steps in the direction of their goal. The environment was very encouraging and as the weekend progressed I felt more confident that this was a project that I could really be enthusiastic about and work at full time.   Today, my last day there, I spent some time preparing a bit of a presentation of my strengths, how I saw their project benefiting from my work, and how I thought I could contribute initially to the development of their research, in an attempt to present myself in favorable light and convince them to let me join. The effort seemed to be a little unneccesary, Peter described himself as very enthusiastic to have me join prior to my discussion. Well, I guess having both parties so interested in each other can only bode well. I've been offered a position there, and I'll probably relocate within the next few weeks. Peter was very generous given their shoestring budget and I am proud to say that I will have some equity in the company. I'm quite excited by the prospect of doing such intelligent work for a living. I see many of the problems I will be able to work on at a2i2 as not only fundamental for progress within the artificial intelligence field, but also in terms of self-understanding. It's important to realize how little we really understand about how intelligence operates in a fundamental sense, and how it can be improved.   More to come. Within the limits of Intellectual Property and the interests of the company, I hope to be able to detail some of my experiences and ideas in starting work at a2i2.   One interesting bit is going to be relocating. This has caught me quite unplanned, and moving quickly is going to be a challenge. In addition to the friends and projects and activities I'm leaving behind, I've got to get my belonging organized in some fashion.   I have to say I am quite surprised to be moving to LA. In general, I haven't been able to predict my life with much success, but I would have said with some confidence that such a move could not have served my wider goals. LA is pretty expensive to live in, it's far from most of the people I know, and it contains few of the organizations and non-profits I contribute to and try to participate in. But the prospect of working for Peter Voss changes almost all of that, as working on AI directly is quite central to my longterm aims.   Such work promises to give insights into self and society quite handily, two more arenas I'm quite interested in. Big days ahead, friends mine.",male,23,Technology,Leo,0

As some of you may or may not know, I'm going down to LA to interview for a position with Peter Voss' AI research team. I've really been working myself up into a sweat, worrying if I'll get the position, whether I should be getting the position, If I should be pursuing such opportunities, the risks of suspending everything I'm doing now, relocating, and trying to make it in a new city, etc etc.  Given some time to sit and be, on the way down the mountains, I allowed myself to think about it again, and I was struck by how reactive and volatile my reaction to these issues has been. I am, and I will continue. The world is, my friends are, and time marches on. I am excited about the opportunity to join Peter's team, and I think I would do well there. And the problems that may incur are simply new problems, not particularly different in scope from the problems I have now. Going down and not being accepted is similarly benign, to wit, nothing changes, I miss a little school, meet some interesting people. In retrospect, I'm surprised I got so worked up about it. It's interesting that when you feel stable, any change can seem big. We become so attached to our views of the future, that new information is immediately adversarial. Another bug, or maybe a feature. I suppose had I lacked his reaction, I would not have examined this situation so minutely.   We'll see what happens.  Relocating to LA will be interesting, if it happens. I know almost no one there, save my biological father's family, most of whom live in the area.

167785,878542,2004-02-20,"The nihilism I feel waiting outside for me, is often more insidious than it might seem. Sometimes it seems like so much happens that insists that I'd be best to abandon what I hold to be important. Sometimes everything seems to devalue and shrink before some harsh light. On valentines day I wrote about the first time I realized that love isn't ever certain, or even ever really lasting. It almost destroyed me because I had found so much joy and so much love within myself that I never had before. The erosion of a bastion I had built within my life left me feeling that nothing could ever be really safe. And I would lose all I cared about. Who could keep caring without some safe place where their feelings were always returned? Without some person to love them when they don't have any emotion of their own, much less to give? But nihilism didn't claim me there. I found value in wandering, without a safe fastness to secure myself. I learned that however hard, you can survive alone long enough to hide your heart in semi-sure places. To go forth in a landscape of only half-trusted places to rest and use.   I miss thinking that there could be safe places. But I am happy. And I have no safe place. That is probably better. In a strange way, the more and worse the battles I wage to keep my caring and direction, the less vulnerable I become. I have less to lose, less places unexamined.   But there are scars. Some I am proud of, and some I leave unannounced, under clothing or camoflage. And they remain different from ever having such weakness, of course. They tug at me through memory or recirculation. I see churches and I remember God. I see schools and I remember my School. I see couples who think they'll never lose the trust and passion and partnership, and I remember Love.

167787,878542,2004-02-20,"There is something about rain that brings up a vicious streak in me. I was walking along, and noted a struggling car. I reflected that it really only takes a tiny nudge to completely derail many things in our everyday lives. No one thinks about this, but a tiny push on the back wheel of a bike could be fatal, fifteen pounds of pressure through a fingertip can break the skin via fingernail. Any object heaved at low relative velocities onto oncoming traffic could spiderweb windshields. Our environment is held together by fragile strings of vulnerabilities that no one ever tests.   It's perhaps fortunate the psychopaths are so bad at planning. It is only the high functioning individuals with social disorders like me that are real threats. Thankfully(and predictably) I am far too attached to my environment to threaten it much. The phenotypes that are likely to do so probably died out very early. Sometimes, though, it all hangs by such a fragile thread.   It would be so easy sometimes, to put down my plans, put down my attachments, and succumb to the nihilism that waits outside the borders of values and feelings. Science is a two edged tool, and it saws at your shiny ideals as it clears away the superstitions and fears. And you can't decide that your values are inviolate, not and hope to remain within science. Accepting a weaker form, a science that says nothing about the things you care about, isn't just less rational, or a compromise. It's nothing.   Understanding requires that you accept new information. No matter where it lands. I have learned three times now, that I was truly and fully wrong about the world. And each time I have felt a terrible draining loss of purpose and hope. Each time I have seen my previous actions in the light of new eyes, and seen how useless, misguided, or counter-productive they were. It's crushing. Every time, some tiny part of my mind that still seeks for truth, while I'm mourning the loss of my last life, says, ""good."" It's good that I realized. Good that I can change. It hurts, but I would rather be hurt by the real world, than go unknowing into the dark night, trusting maps I'd drawn to mislead myself, to keep things the same.   Some things always survive. I'm not my body, or my mind, or my memories. I'm not my values, or my beliefs or even my loves. All of these things have passed on in part or whole. But I am still here. I am the direction of my life.  I am what acts like I do.  I am the center of the system that becomes more and more like I have always wanted to be. And while that may go in directions my past selves may not have seen, it is driven by a core that remains much the same. I remember the first time I woke up from a dream, and cried because it wasn't so. I don't remember the dream, I remember the moment. I remember how it moved me from what I used to be, to what I am. That difference is where my identity can be said to reside.   Many people, impressed by materialistic explanations of a deterministic universe, complain that it leaves no place for choice or free will if we are predictable. I don't understand this objection. I am my history, and I will be my future. How could I act any differently? Perhaps if I were outside myself, or could see all that was and will be, I would seem a small sad wind-up toy. But I can't, and I'm not. I'm the highest of the highest, a brilliant example of a brilliant species, reaching up for the first time from the muck and the dirt and the rage.  I've been telling people for years that I plan to save the world. And by hook or crook, I will. It's not a specific injunction, nor a clear declaration of one plan. I won't allow the world to remain as it is. There are too many things I don't like. That's it. It's a simple decision really, best expressed by Thomas Harris in ""Hannibal"" through the excellent Clarice Starling:   ""The world will not be this way. Not within the reach of my arm.""   I couldn't tell you how I'll end up. And I couldn't say what kind of world it will be when I am satisfied. But I trust in the direction of my life. I will trust that when a Justin Corwin stands, and says he's done, he can look back, and draw a line that connects his opinion to mine. I am sure that I can sort out the details as they come up. the only real problem is determining what direction to face in, and deciding what kind of person I am. Or will be.",male,23,Technology,Leo,0

167794,878542,2004-02-13,"Valentines Day.  This is no fun, no fun at all. Those who know me, know that I've 'suffered' from a lifelong androgen overdose. I'm unsure where it ends and my attention deficit begins, but they have very different genesis and eventual results. I have very strong metabolitic drivers, even when I do nothing for months. I have strong emotions(which I have fought to master all my life). I am unceasingly kinesthetic and love doing physical things, in stark contrast to my personality, which is mostly intellectual and contemplative. I am too fond of conflict, my drives and talents let me excel at things that could only be used to hurt people, and to my regret, I have been in too many fights in my life, and too many of them pointless. I try to hide that aspect of myself, shamefully. I can't think of too many good friends that I've let see myself like that.  I can't sit still when I'm incompletely captivated by something. Everyone I know has seen me pace watching a movie or tv show.   I am deeply, almost constantly, sexually aware. This has caused it's share of problems. But I like to think that I both indulge and control this aspect of myself better now. But this intersects with something else a few people know. I am romantic, and deeply flawed in view of myself and people I am lucky enough to know romantically. I am deeply and bitterly lonely. I have tried, with varying success to find someone who engages me on as many levels as possible. Who makes me feel like everything within me has a partner.   Yesterday, I got to see my ex-girlfriend Carrie. She lives here in LA, and two weeks after I moved here, I got to see her for about two hours. I don't have great expectations of seeing her very often. She has her own life here, and a boyfriend named Tom, whom I've never met, and likely never will. He's said he doesn't want to meet me. This will have a great effect on Carrie, she cares about him, and I'm operating on memories of attachment. But it's not surprising. She broke up with me, after all. She must have had her reasons.   Carrie was probably the person that came the closest to making me feel like I wasn't alone in real life(as opposed to dreams or imagination, both of which I've led very successful romances in, thank you very much). For some reason she was interested in almost everything I was, even if she hadn't encountered it before. She was strong, perhaps as strong as me, emotionally; and physically she was nearly perfect, fast, aggressive, strong,  sexually attractive to me beyond all girls. She is in raw intelligence, among the smarter friends i've been privileged to have. But her knowledge is only defined by what has impacted her personally, she lacked the driving, obssessive curiosity and attention to detail that really encyclopedic knowledge requires. She learned everything very fast. And very well. I don't think there is a single day I have known her that she hasn't impressed or attracted me more; in kindness, physically, or with her decisions.   About a year ago I realized that our relationship was going to end, and I was going to lose her. I can honestly say, that despite all my paranoia, and intelligence and low worse if wiser thoughts, that it had never occurred to me before. But any probability, stretched to long enough time-scale is a certainty. Anything possible will happen, given a long enough wait. And something had come up that could end our relationship. She was committed to moving to go to USC. It wasn't that I thought that would destroy us, but that it had a chance to. I thought I could fix that particular problem. to get past it. But that there was a chance, meant that it would happen, certainly, someday.   It was the closest I have ever come to real suicide. Not desperate attention-seeking, or flailing to escape, but deliberate, aiming to die to stop my life now. I walked to a ten story car park, and sat and thought of ways to ensure that I would hit the asphalt head-first. I must have stayed up there, leaning against the wind, and avoiding the eyes of the drivers parking and leaving, for at least an hour. I was saved by no decision of mine. My limbic system kicked in, and increased my fear and desire to live on until I had to back down.  It has been a secret shame of mine that I'm alive today not because I chose to be, but because, shaking and full of hormones and adrenaline, I couldn't force my body to do it.   I walked to the University computer lab, and asked the smartest person I knew for help. He appealed to the rationalist in me, and showed that she was only a portion of a larger set of goals that I had. that some portion of me would survive, and grow and eventually be larger and better(if not unscarred) than I was now. I didn't tell him about my desire to end my life. It would have complicated things.  It was after that I decided not to. Perhaps if he had been there up on the car park, I would have felt more like it was a part of me, rather than being reduced to a tiny part of this shaking, sniffling animal that didn't want to die.  I left, and I went and walked for a long time. And then I came home, and I lay down next to her, and touched her with trembling fingers and cried, facing away so I wouldn't wake her.  Having faced the larger crisis of eventual loss of her, and by extension, everything I held dear, I went to work on the local crisis. I tried, for the next few months to ensure that I wouldn't lose her at that time. I failed miserably, of course, doing exactly the wrong thing. But that's a subject for another day.  Strangely, despite all this, when she finally did break up with me, I was taken completely by surprise, and spent the next few months in a black hole, that I still can't fully recall. It's only relatively recently that I began to try to tear myself from rethinking and planning and desperate attempts to distract myself. I even started to look at other girls as something other than just people or lust objects. And most recently, I tried to go on dates with a very nice girl named Crystal, whom I am probably hurting by writing all this. It is only the oddest of chances that led me to be here now in LA. Maybe if I had the chance to give Crystal a chance, she could have been for me, a place of safety and comfort and companionship. But I don't think I'll know now. She's now very far away. It is a note of mystery and regret in an otherwise good decision.   It's been a year since I realized, and six months or so since she dumped me. And I am more or less reconciled. On odd nights I dream, and wake up sad, and when I see her I always have wonderful times until it's time to say goodbye, which is always like being dumped again. I have gotten re-acquainted with jealousy. I never worried during our relationship, now, beyond my control,  it's a rising tide of directed anger and suspicion. It would be a close tie which was more painful, the fact she doesn't want me, or the fact that she's so  happy  without me. I at least have the decency to be shattered and quiet and lonely, most of the time. But she broke up with me, so I guess it's to be expected.  It's valentines day, as everyone keeps reminding me, and emails and spam and advertisements proclaim. I guess it's a decent day to examine all this. And I accept it. Since I can't change anything, I can only be happy about what I've gotten. I think I've done better than most people. My sadness isn't relative to them, though, it's relative to my dreams. So in some way, I'll always be sad.  But, also in some ways, so long as I keep doing what I want to, I'll always be happy.  Happy Valentines Day, don't let anyone take your loves away from you, no matter how far-fetched or illconsidered. It's what makes you who you are. And try to find a way to be happy.",male,23,Technology,Leo,0

Quite excellent.   Writing is a cold unfeeling thing. The words don't change, no matter how much you care about them. In reducing communication to words, you must trust in your ability to mash implications down to managable size. And trust that you've done it well enough for another person to reconstruct your attempt. Without help.   This would be a daunting enough task if you didn't realize that you're also being judged against the greatest writers that the reader has ever read. Global talents, who spent their lives entire, honing. This isn't like being an engaging speaker, where your competition is at best, a few hundred people. The average literati has read prose by possibly thousands of writers, who were likely rammed through massively brutal selection processes.   Writing is intensely personal, in that there is no social process that can allow you to learn it, save perhaps for some abortive, transients, like chatting and social webpages, where you must slice your wit to single lines and paragraphs, an editing habit that can help your brevity and wit, but does nothing for pacing, cohesion, or tone. Writing has a terribly slow feedback system, with little detail, and less honesty. You have to learn by falling out of love with your own creations, and by the few rare beautiful people who can tell you what is so broken about what you're trying to say.  Editors are angels, with their cutting, dismissive ways. They're doing you a favor, don't you see!?  They have stopped lying, because they can't lie about writing anymore. It's their  job .

Sadly, it enjoys some popular support from sloppy writers and secondary sources.   I did a bit of research myself, and some of the particulars seem very well supported. There is no other evidence for the race described as 'the ocean of fire' ever having been run in Yemen, and the former Sultan of Yemen is actually quoted in an upcoming book as saying such a race never existed, and never would have been supported culturally in the first place.   Cody's Wild West Show also has no record of Frank Hopkins employment. No record of any his performances exist as first hand sources.   It seems Frank Hopkin's claims of stardom are much the same as Frank Dux's more recent claims of far off conquest. The problem being that now we can simply ask the people who live there if such events actually occured. (Frank Dux's claims of foreign triumph are immortalized in the movie  Bloodsport , which largely replicates unexamined his own publicity.

I have to steal math from other people, assuming they've done it right, and research just about every serious concept I want to use until I think I halfway understand it.   Higher maths are especially difficult. I just don't have a fundamental understanding of most of the concepts. This makes interpreting some physical theory very difficult firsthand.   I mention this because it's very difficult for me to think about concepts that I haven't grounded relatively far down to their constituent behaviors. I had to do some work today regarding clustering of vector information, and spent a good deal of time looking at low dimensionality representation of vector distributions, and how dimensionality affects absolute distance, and things like that.   This lead to various work on display theory, graph theory, things like that. I'm not sure there is an easy way to display that kind of information, but I have a more solid understanding of the kind of data I'm dealing with, anyway.   I also went and did the stairs in Santa Monica again today. The stairs are a set rising up a bluff near the ocean. It's a very very long set, I don't remember the exact number of individual steps, but the rise is quite lengthy.  Last week, I managed a pitiful 5 trips up and down, huffing and puffing.

Amusingly, it was sparked by my post below on truth and facts. Rationalists like facts, because they let you get things done. In a field like mine, where no one has ever done what you're trying to do before, you have a very big lack of metrics and boundaries to guide you. So you take hold of what facts you can, and try your very best to keep close to what you are pretty sure about. And most importantly, you dont' make it any harder than it has to be. Your personal feelings, intuitions, values, or guesses can't interfere when new information comes it. You have to keep moving.   I guess every one is really in that same boat, in the end.

Many would be rationalists seem to be mostly concerned about provability, and having coherent backstories. but the root, the real line to follow, is being as close to the facts as possible.   It's important that we don't get into the awful trap of trying to construct our writings and thoughts in ways that are hard to show as wrong, or very fault-tolerant. It is exactly wrong. We should build our structures in unfortified, vulnerable ways. We should wear our assumptions on our sleeves. Because if we are wrong, we need to know as soon as possible.   I want to know the truth. I want to succeed. I can't do it if I spend my time trying to be right. Defending positions. You can't fight the truth while you keep using parts of it. You just waste time.

In many ways I think this has crippled my development as a geek, but it results in a much more varied life overall.   I was pretty physically active as a kid, partially because of my parents signing me up for things I wasn't particularly interested in. I wasn't encouraged towards anything violent(my mom is something of a pacifist) although I did get to take Tae Kwon Do and Judo for short periods at various times. So no football.

I did pretty well, mostly, in high school I did theatre and cross country, later founding a martial arts club, which probably didn't survive my graduating class, and doing a lot of art my senior year.   I did spend a lot of time reading, and on the computer in my private time, but I've often felt like I'm catching up from behind on such matters. After high school I began to realize the power and importance of computers and technology, and science in general, and began investing time much more heavily in those areas.   As a result I often feel like a second class geek. I started with the dating and socializing pretty early, and never had many issues with that(save the self generated ones), and have lots of life outside those contexts. I don't have deep detail filled knowledge of computers or geek life. Most of my ability in those areas is largely powered by a relatively small dataset, and massive extrapolation.

167843,878542,2004-03-05,"urlLink Man On Fire: April 23,2004 - Large   There is something magical about Denzel Washington. He can play damned characters better than anyone. He doesn't need gritty voice-overs(though he can do them well) he doesn't need strung-out make-up(though he's been given it in the past). All he needs is a story, and a character and a voice. In Fallen, he was the voice of ultimate evil, and the personification of struggle against it. In Training Day he was so much the very idea of rogue police he went past the cliche, a perfect example of the saying that too much is too much, but way too much is just right.   He can portray implacable characters, people who can't be stopped, not because they're so good, or so lucky, or so powerful, but simply because they won't stop. Which is why this movie will be great, no matter how bad it looks, or cheezy the story, or anything. Because Denzel is that guy, for a moment, in every movie. And now there's a whole movie about it.   I love that kind of character. Corwin, arguably my favorite fictional creation of all time, says of himself, that he is just a meddler, skilled in the minor art of survival. That's his magic. No matter what happens, and how the world falls around him, he just keeps going. He is the archetype of stamina. Not brute physical stamina(though he has it) but character stamina, a kind of unbending arrow towards his goals and destiny. That's the kind of person, the kinds of decisions I like to view myself as. No deflection, not even by self. It's characteristic of these kinds of characters to end in prisons of their own making.   This movie is kind of like that. Hopefully they'll make it explicit. Denzel Washington is trapped in the kind of person he has become. The little girl seems to represent his chance to change. And when it's stolen, he reverts to the base of his past, he sinks to the very edge of the blackest things he's done before, to retrieve his hope of being a better person. It's a kind of logic that only makes sense to someone who really feels trapped by who they are. It's a kind of story I like too much.  I'll be seeing this as soon as it comes out.

I wonder if part of the bliss of romantic entanglement isn't that the glow of love gives everything a tinge of importance, and you find that you are not limited to talk about what seems to skim naturally off the surface. You talk and talk and talk, and you are truly sharing everything you can with that person.   It gives new meaning to honesty, in that light. Perhaps real honesty isn't just revising your rules for disclosure, but revising one's sense of 'appropriate-ness'. So that not so much waits for it's proper moment, much less is suppressed in favor of abstract privacy, or to conceal unpleasantness or disingeneous activity.",male,23,Technology,Leo,0

167865,878542,2004-04-18,"Art.  As some of you may or may not know, of the art that I make, poetry is the most accesible to me, and sculpture the most interesting. Currently, all I really do with sculpture is build complex sandcastles on my lunch breaks.   But today I was thinking of mechanical sculpture, those wonderful, interactive, mobile pieces of art that usually mean steely clangy things, springs and nuovo industrial motifs. This needn't be the case, of course, one could just as easily construct frameworks out of bamboo, or wood, or flowing plastics. they could be silently electric, noisily electric, water powered, gravity powered, air rams, etc etc. I've really been kind of dissapointed with the variety that I've seen.  But that aside, I was thinking that mechanical sculpture does present an opportunity for finite art. In that you could construct an enfolding experience that cannot be preserved. Suppose you make a sculpture that is folded and boring. The viewer walks up, presses the view button. The sculpture comes alive, unfolds into it's appointed experience, give the viewer his show, and then retreats to it's folded state. But it changes in the enfolding. perhaps it damages it's framework. perhaps it simply changes.   And a counter, showing the times the button has been pressed, increments. 201 views. And one day, when the button is pressed, that is the end. The sculpture breaks, or freezes, or simply shuts down, never again to flower. The art dies, and is only now a corpse, existing in the memories of those who have seen it. And whatever fragmentary records might exist, those who tried to videotape the unfolding, pictures of parts of the unfolding. written accounts, are all that is left. (although the creator, being nice, might have included instructions on how to build another one even so, the 'original experience' is gone.).   Taking it further, it should be possible to create a sculpture that reacts differently every single time the button is pressed. movements of increasing or decreasing complexity, gracefully failing components, etc etc. This is personal art, every single viewer has a truely unique relationship with.   Imagine the sticker price of a sculpture with just ten views left on it, imagine how focusing it would be. People would be desperate to see it, to appreciate it. And that would of course, add to what they see. Add to what it means.   I should talk to a mechanical engineer about graceful degradation, and how useful it is as a concept.   This of course, could be done in a very cheesy way, with simple counters and deactivation, but I think it's more meaningful, and less cheap if the death of the art is from actual change, rather than imposed change. It's lifetime should be inherent in the structure, not added with an electronic counter and a motor.   Ah, for more free time. I think I'll see if I can't whip up a prototype in autoCAD or something, when I have a moment.",male,23,Technology,Leo,0

167869,878542,2004-04-15,"Today I was reminded of a project I've tried my best to forget because of the painful and hideous loss involved.   Some time ago, I spend a good deal of time developing a documentation program called Document Designr, whose primary function was to enable the production and navigation of very complex design specifications, and other networks of interdependent description/notes or text.   Basically it was an XML data format that encapsulated XHTML text files, with the extension, predictably enough of .ddd . It was implemented as an XUL application, on Mozilla 1.4, so it could use the Mozilla Composer to manage the XHTML, and other components for various functions, navigation, rendering, compression, etc etc. It was a very clever idea that I got from someone else, who was quite looking forward to the development, I think.   Then I lost all the data, and all the work.   In fact I lost all my data. My journals, my databases, my online texts, my carefully hoarded archived mails, websites, pictures, lists. It totally derailed me. I had come to rely on the portion of myself I had documented and offloaded onto the computer. In the larger tragedy, DocDesignr was lost. I never reopened the work, and the sourceforge project remains completely empty. It's an object lesson in the neccesity for remote backups and other basic issues.   Today I was reminded of it. I work at an AI research firm, which means our main currency is in ideas. We investigate things,  write about them, implement them, and research more. Our conclusions we come to through consensus, meeting, tests, and a bit of luck. Unfortunately, we generate a lot of ideas. And our discussions raise more. Last month, we produced about 40 documents. This represents maybe half of the total issues we dealt with. Many exist only as memories of words spoken at a brainstorming session, and some brief notes on a paper easel we have.   Even with issues and projects we have written documentation on, much information exists as experience, or things discovered after the documentation is written, but too small to warrant a rewrite.  Today I reopened a task we researched and discussed last month. To my shame, I had to open the document and spend several minutes reviewing it before I could even be certain I remembered completely the conversations we had on it. I should spend some time flipping through the easel archives to ensure I don't miss points raised in brainstorming. And even when I've done that, I won't be certain I haven't lost something in the intervening month.   This is obviously suboptimal. But what is the alternative? More documents? Already navigating the folder with the last month's is dependent on previous experience, and a good feel for what indicates content. The overhead involved in writing everything we do down is already considerable, and time spent writing down ideas is time spent not having them, particulalry when such ideas do not strike as part of the composition process, but in brainstorming meeting, review, or in working with a particular test case.   More time gathering information? I could requiz everyone involved in the original spec and research, collating their responses into an updated document, but that would take time, and could even introduce recollection errors. the responses might not agree, and which one would I take as authoritative. When does review and research become re-research of the original issue?   It's interesting to note that there are two divergent issues here, although related, seem to indicate differing solutions. One, the generation of more and better documentation regarding work done. More bits recorded and accessible. Two, the documentation that currently exists is already too unwieldy to navigate with precision and too time-wasting to keep up.   I think, however, that there is a single dynamic that holds a partial answer to both.   It's interesting here to diverge into a quick overview of a company that speaks very closely to the issue at hand. Google. In the news recently for their email initiative, gmail. I don't know how many of all you keep records of all your emails. But, particularly if you write many, you really should keep them all. You'd be surprised how much data lies therein, and how useful it is.  But beyond what you remember, the navigation quickly becomes one of threads and dates. Imagine, however, that every email you've sent or recieved lies within the reach of a single search engine. And not just a port of grep or a simple text matching box, but the fastest, most complicated, most semantic searching parser in the world, hooked up to the biggest map of the internet, and indeed all information in the world. Now that would be magic. It's enough to put up with nearly any price. And it certainly seems that google is counting on this.Privacy concerns aside:  The strange thing here is that google, unlike most distributed targeted services, only gets better the more people use it. Every bit in the database more makes the database that much more relevant and comprehensive. It's to their advantage to nearly give storage space away, and they seem to recognize this. Witness gmail's vaunted gigabyte of storage space. People imagine they are taking advantage of google, when they are literally handing google the keys to their data, and providing more context, more categorization, and more associative links for free.   Google's strategy points to a solution to the smaller domain of project documentation that sparked this entry. The dynamic that will solve the two seemingly contradictory problems. The solution isn't pruning, or increased documentation overhead. It's far simpler than that. The solution is to simplify, enlarge, and integrate the data, just as google attempts to do. Do all you can to get all the data into a common database(google parses pdf's, meta-tags, pictures, news, rdf, html, txt, powerpoint, auto-translates, and god knows what else now, all to get it into a big honking map of links and keywords.) then keep it all. Don't filter, don't delete. Don't manage it as a total resource, but manage it per request. Pre associate as much as you can, but don't try to semanticise past your parser's capability. Remember vivisimo? yeah, me too, just barely.   I remember the first time I ran a search across a database of IRC logs, archived email, personal documentation, and journal entries. It was like watching points leap out from the darkness. It was like having a perfect memory, like I used to think I had.  imagine such a search, including email send and received, google's webpages, google groups, google news. auto-translated pages from elsewhere in the world. autotranslated emails from people in those countries. a true constellation of data, all ruthlessly ripped through to generate a itemized list, organized by relevance, and served with a timer printed at the top, gloating at it's own speed.   For the special case of projects like this, I imagine some great cousin to my poor abandoned baby DocDesignr, logs of conversations, raw text of personal notes. Data from tests and output from software. formal design documents. outlines of brainstorms. drawn pictures. all related not just by content, but by date/time entered, by relationships associated at parsetime, or later added automatically, or intentionally. related according to information obtained during the parsing of other documents. presented as a huge honking network of interlinks and keywords. browseable from a known starting point, or searchable. Representing the sum total of data, but never presenting more than relates to each request.   Add a bidirectional interface, allowing explicit relationships to be drawn, text to be amended and appended. present the database as a network of arbitrary hierarchies and heterarchies, mix it into a distributed, ever growing network resource, and you'd really have something.   Ironically enough, the service I'm describing is quite possible. It may even be somewhat the direction google intends to move. It's probably incredibly useful for nearly everything. It would likely make my job a hell of a lot easier to have such a thing to work with. But I am not the person to develop it. I dont' know who is. It's easier than AI, it's more commercial than AI, and it would probably skyrocket the successful inventors to superstardom. Sadly, it is at best an enabler for my own research, and even if I had incredible free time for it, I likely am not enough of a databaser or software engineer to do it myself.  Oh, but I can imagine it so well I can taste it.   Perhaps I should look at my surviving notes and documentation on docdesignr after all. I could probably get by on an hour less sleep a night.....",male,23,Technology,Leo,0

I also dislike being torn between furious reprisal and begging.   Yeah, I tried to write something to carrie, and formatted it as a genuine and informative thing, as a snapshot of my thoughts and feelings, rather than analyzing it to death and formatting for chance of understanding and success.   I keep forgetting she doesn't care about me anymore and has no inclination to read for content and correct for context. So I get a vaguely nice put-down back, and I don't know what to say in return.   On one hand, I should just say what I think, and be done. I'm pretty certain I don't have much of a chance for any kind of actual friendship with her, as it is, I'm pretty much being tolerated, I think. Carrie has always felt this sense of duty to include people,  despite not having much of an interest in them as people. I remember how she was so nice and inclusive and helpful to Brad, despite his issues. I don't really want or appreciate that kind of position. It sounds nice, but you end up seeing her once a month, and having to initiate and sustain all the communication that occurs, and for what? Some sense of being there? A little kick of hope every time she keeps talking to you? No thanks.   On the other hand, I don't want to lose contact with her. She knows me pretty well. Probably better, in terms of details and experience than anyone. Her knowledge of me is skewed because she only saw me in my soft caring persona, only knowing me in Salt Lake City, while we were dating most of the time. So, given how well she knows me, it hurts that she seems to be so uncomfortable and disinterested in my presence, or thoughts. Is it a function of my characteristics, or hers? It almost doesn't even matter. Even supposing she had lost her mind ten seconds before I moved here(as she acted very differently back in SLC even after she left me) the judgement still hurts. She is the kind of person that I want to like me. I cared about her more than any person I've ever had a relationship with.  I still care about her, even if it's poisoned with regret and loss and loneliness now.   She would no doubt prefer that I provide my services as a friend, be happy in her presence, entertain, enjoy, and so on.  I can understand not wanting to deal with someone else as a thinking feeling entity, who may not be in perfect synch with you. It's easier to ask them to shut up about anything you don't want them to talk about, and keep things in areas you enjoy. But that's not actually being friends with someone. It's just saying you are, and ignoring everything about them you don't like.   You would think that eight months and a decision to leave a relationship behind me would deaden the emotions about a person. I probably won't ever date Carrie again. I have known this, if not quite accepted it, for a good time now. It's one of those things you have to decide to get through the blackness of loss. It's something I reconfirmed to myself time and time again, as things went on. But while that kind of decision changes your approach, the way you plan, the things you hope for, but it doesn't kill the emotions that remain. There is no bleach for the soul, that I have found.   I wish that I could be as blase' as she is, and walk away from the emotions and desires that come with sharing something like that for so long. Maybe she never felt the way that I did. I liked to imagine that I could tell how she felt. That we communicated in silence.   I guess this is all ancient history. It should be to me. It keeps rising up because she's here now, in front of my eyes(occasionally) when she had just disappeared after leaving me.   This has been nagging in the back of my mind since yesterday. I wrote something to her last night about it, and got her reply today. I haven't replied back yet, and I don't know what to say.  I've taken two long walks and a ridiculously long nap and shower, to indulge my thoughts, and haven't managed to exorcise, or come to a decision, so I turned to the last resort, the blog. It's really been occupying me more than it should, and I think I'll lay it to rest for the moment. I have other work to do, and other people to care about.   Corey is out, and better, and seemingly legal-trouble free(very good).  Crystal and I continue to correspond, and I wish she were out here, so that I could talk to her about it. She's been through some rough stuff in the past, and I feel like we have some commonality of interest and understanding. It's too bad that I met her when I did, otherwise, things might be happier.  Talking to her long distance is very strange, I feel like I can't quite render the same connection into words and elements in emails, and she has the oddest spelling I've ever encountered. It's strangely compelling, but horrifically incorrect. It spoils much of what she says to me, until I correct it for myself.   Talked to Noel not too long ago, he's still getting married, and pretty happy about it, insofar as text can communicate. I'm happy for him. I need to talk to Amanda more, get to know her better. I've also been corresponding with other ex highschool friends, as I have time on the computer nowadays(don't get out much).   The Job is of course, great. I'm very interested in what I'm doing, though I have let my personal affairs drop my productivity yesterday, the issues with Carrie, writing letters to Crystal, etc.  I am feeling better about it tonight, I managed to get two environments largely in the bag, and I've got a lock on the next ones, I think. I need to focus more. There is so much for me to learn, and I really want to be good at this stuff. I know that I can be. I feel the shapes and concepts coming. It's like turning your thinking to rationalist patterns. You push and push and push, and you begin to feel the right kinds of patterns and shapes of thoughts. The kind with support and tests, and so on. AI is a field with too much to catch up on. I read and read, and work and work. I have to run before I can really quite walk, if I want to make it. And besides the theory of mind and research, I have to make sure not to get snagged by the specific system implementation details, the scripting, the environments, the little things I have to do to be in a team. It all has to be right.     I want to share a thought I had, some time ago, on the beach. I thought about why berserkers and suicide bombers are so dangerous. It's because they've chosen to let no other considerations enter into their behavior, they're unstoppable because they only have a single success condition. If someone xoxed Royce Gracie, Bruce Lee, and Batman into a single being, and set them in front of me, and said they'd grant me anything I wanted so long as I physically beat it, I would be happy, and without a worry. Because  all I'd have to do is win.  When it doesn't matter what else happens, and you have only one thing to worry about, then you can't be stopped. There are too many selfsacrificing maneuvers that work.   This is why so much of the martial arts is really learning to let go of considerations, not to worry about being injured, or dissapointing someone, thinking about hurting them, etc. If you can distill yourself into a single purpose, the flow and advantage of this makes you invincible. And this dynamic is visible everywhere. It is the essence of the Buddhist concept of self awareness without self-contemplation. Do what you are doing, and that only.   I realized, that as a dynamic, the complexity of that single goal is immaterial. It can be anything. So long as all your actions can flow from it alone, you can specify an arbitrarily detailed success condition. So long as it truly is a single desire. This is the strength that forms the basis of a great many deep truths.  The light of rationality, the power of the dedicated life, why romantic focus gives you so much strength in return. Yudkowskian probabilistic supergoals, the tendency of fixated or obssesed people to succeed, the genesis of such traits within reproductive fitness. I suppose it's a kind of 23 truth. The smarter you are, the more you see it around you. But it is a decent enough little mantra, for when you are unsure if you can do something. you can probably do it, if all you have to do is win.   back to work.",male,23,Technology,Leo,0
167883,878542,2004-04-04,"Man.  Unpleasant. Last night, I went up to USC to go to a play. And ended up seeing Hellboy and Hollywood Ending, (both of which were better than I expected).   I had a pretty good time.   Until it came time to leave.  It was then that I was confronted with a simple problem. The car wouldn't start. Nothing. No noise, no reaction. I checked. the light switch was partially activated. Crap.   When I had drove up, it had been darkening, but not dark. So I had turned the lights on for the benefit of the other drivers, but not noticed when I got out because it was still too light out to see the headlamps.   Thus the beginning of my ardous journey in search of a jumpstart. Passerby were no use. Police didn't help.  Eventually the fine people at Facilities for USC took pity on me, and sent a truck over to help. Which took about ten seconds, because the jump took very quickly. Then I was on my way.  I was able to just drive straight home, because it was mostly freeway driving, and the charge took fine. Looks like the alternator is healthy, anyway. The only downside really at all, is losing some sleep, and about a half-day of work.   I'll take a nap, and stay up late.

167885,878542,2004-04-02,"urlLink Running.com - Your Site for Running   woot.  I got up around 5:30 and ran for thirty minutes today. It was enlightening. I managed it, just barely, which is good. It's been a while since I've run continuously for that long. I should remember to do so more often. For the health and capability benefits, sure, but afterwards, I'm always left with the confirmation that my concept of 'hard' when applied to thinking, is grossly miscalibrated. I always find it easier to approach difficult mental problems after completing some physical task(that is difficult, that is, sallying forth to the kitchen in quest for some chocolate wafers doesn't quite work)  Yesterday I was vaguely intimidated by a simple scripting language, and some parameter errors and exceptions! Not enough to affect much of what I did, or how I approached it, but it was something that gave me some pause, and affected my emotional balance. I was shifted towards cautious. Silliness. Having to push and push physically really puts the value of mental toil in perspective.   But in some ways physical stress is much easier to approach and handle than mental stress. The solution is right there. You either stop, and fail, or keep moving your legs, and continue. You can set little goals for yourself, to the lamppost, to the street, to the next light, until my runnning partner stops.  Mental stress doesn't have that simple interface.   You have to learn to trust in your personal strength and intelligence. To expect yourself to fill in the gaps as you go along. You can't look forward and see the operations you'll have to do. Building a realistic and accurate picture of your abilities, what they require, and how that affects the task.  It is vaguely like physical toil, in that you must know what you can do, what it takes, and that you can trust your body to fulfill what you ask of it.   In all things, self awareness.   A bit of arrogance and self confidence doesn't hurt either. I Can do this. It helps to have a partner in crime to push you along. You Will do this.   I am reminded of Carrie. (I know I know, but we lived together for two years, I'm allowed to be reminded of her occasionally) We constantly were talking about excercising together, or setting up a time to work out and things like that. We never did it. It was really a missed opportunity. It would have been nice to do things like that together.   I really went physically downhill in those two years, looking back. I was in decent shape in 2000, when we met, and I'm just now getting back into something like physical fitness. That probably was unpleasant for her. Well, I don't think actual obesity or such things is ever really in the cards for me, but I did lead a very sedentary life towards the end, and I probably was much less attractive. An unpleasant thought.  Strange thoughts to come of running. You could probably stand to go run for thirty minutes. Perhaps it will allow you to ruminate upon diverse subjects afterwards as well. It certainly makes breakfast afterwards pleasant.",male,23,Technology,Leo,0

I've deleted my original comments, as the paper has changed somewhat, but I expect to re-enter them predictably soon, when I have a concrete reaction.  This morning we went on a decent length hike up the santa monicas with peter, josh, todd, louise, and I. Me and Peter spent a good deal of the hike talking about this paper, it's relationship to the work we're doing, and our own ideas on the subject. We of course, didn't manage to explore everything, but I found a good deal of things to think about, it was very absorbing.   Also, the mountains, lovely. There are some really smashing homes up there, which we saw at various heights and perspectives as we tromped upward and back. It would really be lovely to be able to live in a place like that, I think. Of course, this is to be contrasted with my love of high density residential environments, so take that for what it's worth.

There are many lovely things around here, the beaches, the boardwalk, my nice new home, the various splendors of california.

First, wrapping up this round of investigation into category nodes, a recently implemented grouping and associative mechanism before I leave on my weekend trip.  Interesting stuff.  Also, we had the first of what may become weekly lunches and discussions here at a2i2. We raised more general and philsophical issues, in terms of assumptions, differences of opinion, and so on. Being that we work as we do, most of it centered around AI, of course, but we did manage to have a bit of discussion of Objectivism, personal histories, etc.  One of the more interesting topics was a discussion of whether or not human intelligence represents anything unusual in intelligence-space, that is, if intelligent entities would have any reason to reach human intelligence, or have any special difficulty surpassing it.   Also raised, the subject of whether external safeguards and engineering caution can reduce the risk of mislaid cognitive design, or pathological goal systems. (Me and Peter agree, No)  Also raised, and tabled till next week, whether or not an intelligent being can be directed by an explicit goal system without the being 'escaping' out from under it, either pathologically, or intentionally. (Strong Disagreement here, I state that a properly designed goal system can be known to be  directional, consistent, and stable(the consistency and desireability of the goals.. another issue). Peter states that goal systems can't 'constrain' intelligence systems knowably. We'll see next week.)  Also:   group discussion of our efficacy as a team, with specific inquiries into my habits, productivity, communications, role, etc. Mostly positive of course(being such a genius and asset to any such team ;-) but some useful criticism, and some genuinely new ideas emerge.

My own interpretation being that it's formatting exchanges for communication first, which in many cases includes social niceties as a consideration. Humans are social creatures with social instincts.

Perhaps we'll all be off like shots, laughing our heads off at incomprehensible jokes, and watching entertainment that revolves around increasingly complicated central premises.   Or perhaps we'll continue to be shaped by our human directionality, and we'll simply get team sports doing ever more interesting things, and other elaborations of human-space entertainment.   It's strange. When one contemplates great change and great possibility, I get an odd rush of protectiveness about the way I am now, and think about staying in this space for a while to really appreciate it, before running off and doing odd things willy-nilly. This tendency has grown stronger, the more I delve into futurism.   My conception of 'staying around this space' is quite different than most, I imagine.

I have tried over-organization, tried emotional ties, tried self-reward, aversive training, combinations of the above... etc etc.  I am effective. I do a lot in an average day, though to many outside it does not seem so. I know that I have trouble renormalizing my priorities with what many consider standard. Things that fail some personal criterion fall very low, sometimes to my detriment. I know I'll never be terribly good at managing money, for example, and I have some understanding of where the holes in my competence are, and for various reasons, am not planning to try to rectify it too strongly. Entangled factors. There is also the conservation of inertia. It's hard enough to change yourself, it's best to direct what will I have into areas that are more pressing, and more rewarding.   But, as things go, I have somewhat complicated ways of motivating, ordering, and planning for my various initiatives. They work, to a greater or lesser extent.   But today showed me more flaws in it. So I'm tearing many of them out, and starting afresh. I have a new system, which I'll need to drill into myself with various minders, and a new set of tricks. Hopefully, en total, I'll get more performance per mental unit of effort. We'll see.   I'll note details of my system as they get worked out more clearly.

I think it's the obvious next step, and I'm just waiting for always-on mobile internet connections before trying to make the switch myself.   Wearables aren't mainstream yet, but a certain kind of mobile computing is, cellphones. Cellphones are general computers and getting more and more powerful every day. Some people think that they are leading the way towards localization of computer and internet access. I must admit, the more powerful smartphones look a great deal like general personal computers. I could use a Treo 610 for.. almost everything except development for my job.   We'll see.   Here is a captured message from a mailing list. Thanks to Eugen Leitl for forwarding it.  ============================================================== From: ""Thad E. Starner""   Date: Tue, 13 Jul 2004 22:40:59 -0400 (EDT) To: wearables@cc.gatech.edu Subject: [wearables] On-body computing outsells desktops + laptops 3:1 (sales stats)  Folks-         Popular Science magazine asked me to write a ""future headline"" blurb for them.  What we gave them was  2015 Intel Abandons Desktop Market (Thad Starner and James Fusia III)  In a surprise move today, Intel announced it will no longer support its processors for the legacy desktop market. Simultaneously, the chip giant announced five new low power processor lines for the wearable and embedded markets.  Since 2003, processors for on-body computers have outsold desktop and laptop processors combined.   Intel was best known during that period for its relatively power hungry x86 desktop processors.  This 3:1 figure for 2003 has become part of my regular talks now.  Popular Science didn't believe the stats, so I had to point to some standard industry sources to back it up.  I thought y'all might find these stats and pointers useful.  Summary: 164M total PCs sold in 2003 (Gartner) 128M desktops+servers sold in 2003 (IDC + Gartner) 36M laptops (IDC) ------- 510M-533M mobile phone handsets (Gartner Dataquest) 24M portable compressed (i.e. computerized) music players (InStat) ------ 10.4M PDA sales (IDC) -------- 600k Tablet PC sales (IDC estimate mid-2003) [DETAILS and URLs BELOW]  Tablet PCs are not doing very well (no surprise, given that the same idea did not do well in the early 1990s).  More interesting to me, however, is that PDA sales are declining from 12.6M in 2002 to 10.4M in 2003!!  Basically, as Brad Rhodes predicted, the road to wearables seems to be through the mobile phone.  Even more interesting, by my calculations, Nokia is now the #1 consumer computer manufacturer in the world (55M handsets vs 28M desktop+laptop computers by HP-17% of the market).  Before y'all get on my case about that one, remember that most of Nokia's phones are more powerful than the highest end desktop in 1990!  Here is an interesting question: How many handsets run the Symbian OS? Or, for shock value, when will Symbian overtake Microsoft Windows as the dominant OS platform on the planet given current growth rates?  No wonder Microsoft is fighting so hard to get into the phone market! Not only is it the only way to continue its growth, but it may be the only way for it to survive as we know it! (Shhh, don't tell them - do you really want to rely on Windows for your phone calls?  Think about it.)  My prediction?:  We will see the phone take over more and more of the usual PC tasks until the PC becomes as irrelevant to the dominant computing culture as the minicomputer or mainframe.

We're looking for brilliant minds, know anyone?   My time here has been very happy, and quite productive. In analysis, while my activity in most other areas is severely depressed by my isolation and focus, I am getting more concrete things accomplished than by working on my own. With a the serious plus that I'm contributing to a still greater pool of collective accomplishment, of course.   Also pluses that I know do interesting work full time. Which is actually more stressful than I would have thought. While I found part time work in unrelated fields stressful, I think I may have used it as a way to rest the less developed parts of my brain. Working here has re-introduced me to the pain of inadequate mental performance, having to self-limit work for quality, and etc. It's a good thing, though. I think my performance will ultimately rise permanently as a result of some of the mistakes I've made and learned from here.

And then the question would arise, what precisely can I do, in order to continue contributing towards my goals, which are currently predicated on the assumption that nothing in my path is beyond me personally. I can't very well expect others to carry me to my own goals. As much as I respect and like Peter, I can't measure by his capability and understanding, it's not mine.

The saga begins: Operation SOMEHOW GET TO ITALY has commenced.    urlLink    This is the beautiful Embassy Suites Room where these lovely ladies and I had the pleasure of staying.  We got to eat dinner for like three whole hours that night!  And the lady thpoke a Thpanith.  (spokeaspanish).  Molly and I had a good night of Bridget Jones in the next room's King sized bed, and all four of us had a slumber party where we exchanged major secrets like any good sleepover.  It was quite fun, actually, for not being in Italy.  Or so we thought, until we actually got to Italy and realised that, wait, it was much cooler.    urlLink    Alice and I on the bus going BACK to the airport.  The sad part is that we're happy cause we THINK we have a flight.  Ah, so misled! God damn that Rachel.  No, we wasted our energy being happy thinking we were going to Canada.  Imagine!  Being happy to go to Canada!   Also note the matching polos and pearls.  Nice touch, no? It is our Puertorican Style showing through. Okay, so here's Cita and I looking wonderfully fakely happy and kind of not well rested.  I look really gross in this picture, why am I posting it?  Oh well.    urlLink    This lady was extreemely awesome.  Conor called her a ""Mother Hen"" cause she led us little chicks across this CRAZY WORLD we call.... Heathrow?  Yeah.  That one in London.  Right-o.  Anyway, the weird thing about Airports in London, or at least this one is that NOBODY TALKS! It's amazing, a public place that sounds like a library! It's increadible, and definately scary, cause we, the loud Americans that we are, made lots of noise.  Oh by the way, these are the lucky eight who made it onto a flight. Nine were stillstuck in Dulles.  Thus the happy smiles we all have.  Still Rockin the Polos, a day later. mmmm.  Rock on, flight attendant lady, we love you.    urlLink    This is us after a few hours in the airport.  Let's just say that we all smelled, well, quite aweful after a long time of traveling.  Planes smell bad.  Molly re-deoderizes, and saves us all from her stench.  Note Brett's expression.  Is he offended by Molly's smell? Nah, he's just tired.  No drama here, sorry guys.    urlLink    NOT AMUSED!  But we made it!  Molly and I are on a train from Rome to Naples, where we would meet Mr. Slipek.  No wait, Mr. Slipek was on the train.  Yeah, where we would meet Mr. Ross and the rest of the kids.  Those lucky bastards who made it.  Anyway,  this is us completely looking and feeling completely like shit.  again, why do I post this?  I know not.  But note the snazzy new $10 watch my mom got me from Target.  It broke, the jerk.  But oh well.  I think this is the last Polo picture, I am afraid, because we smell so bad that these clothes went directly into a bag I labeled ""Condemned!"" and were not brought out of it again until I got home.  Man did they stink.  Alright, enough about the stinking.    urlLink    My first ever view of..... that's right...... ITALY!!!! so we made it.  Note the, uh, glare from the flash on the left.  and the uh, mountains.... i think.... and uh..... anyway, this train ride was so amazing, it was one of the best parts of the trip because I got to take in Italy's beautiful scenery all at once, and while everybody on the train was sleeping I just kept looking out the window in awe, it was so cool.  the scenery was this dramatic, there were aqueducts in front of mountains and cliffs and the mountains went up into these rolling puffy clouds and you couldn't see the tops.  And the coolest thing about it was the yellow tint to everything, it seemed like another planet.  It was so increadibly beautiful, I was so so thankful to finally be there. Despite my expression in the last picture of utter fatigue.    urlLink    We reuinite with the oh so fragrant and showered Sara Warren, and then we showered, and this is the view from our room.  I'm talkin Ruins, Ocean, and yes, even powerlines.  We had our own balcony.  Did I meantion we were showered?  That is why we are so damn happy.  Besides the fact that we finally made it to the most beautiful place ever.  This is ""The Villa""  outside of Naples, and Mr. Ross's favorite place we stay.  I like it Because of the Eggs in the morning, which is what I can eat.  Actually I like it for the general food.  Its really good.  Mmmm, showered.  Clean clothes.  You have no idea just how good they felt.   urlLink    The roomies.  And Sam Blankenship.  Who is quite Awesome.  This is just our room again.  It was a really nice room, too, if i do say so myself.  Note the view, my bed is the one in front, and um, yeah thats about it. The villa rocks.    If you went on the trip, or wish you did, make some comments for me so I'll post more.  Put your own captions to the pictures if you want to.  Also, if you went on the trip and have some photos, I'd love to put them up here, you can IM me at volleyballgal459, thanks.",female,17,Student,Aquarius,1

However, i just decided to take a picture of it anyway.  A bunch of people in my group looked at me really weird, too, cause I was taking pictures of a random......... a random......... uh I don't even know what this is. But rock on.  The most common grafitti was ""Ti Amo"" (I love you) whoever their love was.

That big distant road going up that mountain thing is a feat that a lot of people climbed.  See that grey thing on the next hill up?  Sara, Tracy, Allie, Alice and I sat there.  Much more relaxing. Also: See everyone leaned over the rail? They're looking at fish.  Tons and Tons and Millions of fish.  They like kill each other over the food we threw in there.  I got one to jump out of the water.  We were touristy, but whatever.  This was like 30 minutes of fun, right here, feeding and watching those damn fish. It was so increadibly fun.  And then we ate sandwiches with our bare hands. Yum.  But all the fish though are dead on the other end of the pond. Yum.      urlLink    Sara, Me, and Alice  with Principessa Cane, A combination of the two names Alice and Sara tried to give it. I just call it that.  They have their respective names.  I dont care.  Its a street dog. There were so many street dogs in Italy. It was our pet for a while when we waited for the kids to do their climbing thing.  And so we posed with the waterfall and the dog and then played with it for almost as long as we played with the fish.  Oh, what a circus.  Anyone know that line? no. Sigh, where's Carlton when you need him.    urlLink    This is the view from where we were sitting.  There was a street below us, as you can see, so I waved to the cars for a while when other people were writing in their journals.  Or climbing that big thing.  Hehe, you can see that statue's butt.  Yeah.  Mmmm.  So our first day in Italy comes to a close thus.     urlLink    The next day we go to Paestum.  This is that awesome Temple to Hera II (And behind it there is Temple to Hera I)  And I dunno I thought I'd be artsy and take it with the tree and all, my first view of it because it was so damn increadible looking.  This temple is HUGE, and so so so so SO old.  It looks amazing, I'm so lucky to be able to see stuff like this.  I'm a dork, I was so totally into this stuff.  Isn't it cool looking?

Which I just did.  Anyway, yeah. Fanta rocks.    urlLink    This is the rest of our group eating.  Notice the weird man to the right of Ms. Hefty? That would be Ciro the Awesome, our bus driver.  Even Coke, as you can see, comes in huge glass bottles like that, (like the fanta did) in Europe, which was quite weird.  Also all the water was bottled and if you didnt ask for it ""senza gas"" it came all bubbly.  Which was quite weird, but I somehow came to enjoy it.  I don't know how.    urlLink    And then, like the smooth kid I am, dropped the Camera.

This picture was taken by Francesco, a friend we all made at that town who was pretty cool and enjoyed Oasis.  So we all sang ""Wonderwall"" and had an Almost-Famous caliber bus sing-along.  It was wonderful.    urlLink    The view from this place was AMAZING, this picture really doesnt capture it, but man,  it was so breathtaking to look down upon the town and just to be able to see for miles (or I guess kilometers....... ew makes me think of Physics) out onto the ocean.

She was like my little Italian friend and she gave me a hug when I left and everything.  I loved her.  Here's also a good view of..... well the view.  I forgot her name, but she was very cool.    urlLink    Me at the Beach in Sapri.  Sapri was the first big town we visited, which was nice.

174401,3839660,2004-07-15,"Modern society operates under many falsehoods - and one of the larger ones that has an extraordinary effectiveness at keeping Christians quiet is the ""H"" word...Hypocrite.  Here's how it goes:      Those who speak about Christ and their faith in the public arena (that is, anywhere outside of the home or church) are hypocrites unless they, themselves, are perfect in their own lives.       Got that?  In fact, sometimes a person doesn't even need to speak publicly about his or her faith.  Many times one can merely be a committed, practicing Christian and yet be labeled a hypocrite....Why you ask?  Well, many believe that the simple act of attending mass regularly - of calling oneself a Christian - is a pious statement of moral superiority over others who do not attend.  And if a Christian has the gall to bring his or her faith into a public forum - to talk about Christ or his teachings - that individual risks a severe backlash...criticism that they are attempting to force their values on other people, and scorn if they fall short of those values in any public way.  They risk the dreaded label of ""hypocrite.""      We don't like hypocrites in our society - one of the rare Christian values that has taken root in secular society.  It connotes tremendous phoniness and lack of authenticity - something Christ attributed to the biblical Pharisees who preached the letter of the law while violating the heart of the word.  In today's age, ""hypocrisy"" has become one of the more damning charges a person can hurl at another.  So it stands to reason that most of us try to avoid the label, keeping quiet about our faith and Christ's teachings.  We leave the preaching to the perfect people - that is, the real hypocrites.  The rest of us employ kind of a ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy in our lives so as not to place ourselves on any kind of moral pedestal.  We tell ourselves that we'll wait to spread the word about Christ when we're better behaved - when we come closer to being the perfect Christian.  Only then will we share our religious faith with others.  Of course, that day will never come because sharing the word of God is part of BEING a perfect Christian.  If we shut others out of our faith and religious experiences, we will never BECOME more perfect.       Today, the ""hypocrite"" label is a trap that acts to keep Christians in the closet.  Yet the bible never tells us that we need to be perfect to share the work Christ is performing in our lives.  It doesn't say that we have to be biblical scholars to share one of Christ's teachings.  Consider the model of  Alcoholics Anonymous .  The whole premise of AA is one alcoholic helping another.  For those of you who don't know how AA operates, when a newbie attends a meeting for the first time, one of the first things that happens is the newbie gets paired up with a Sponsor.  The Sponsor is, basically, a more seasoned recovering alcoholic who supports and guides the newbie through the ten step recovery process.  Although the Sponsor has been dry for a period of time, he or she is STILL very much an alcoholic - still tempted by regular urges to have a drink.  Yet the Sponsor is placed in the role of mentor and teacher to the newbie - one alcoholic teaching another alcoholic how to be sober, passing along moral guidance (and, in some cases, moral judgement) on the newbie's behavior.  The philosophy, of course, is that the act of teaching and sharing IS a learning process in and of itself - it helps to reinforce the Sponsor's own commitment to sobriety, as much as it helps the newbie stay sober.     The greater parallel to life is obvious.  We are all sinners.  Should this be an obstacle to sharing Christ's work in our lives?  Take me for instance...Let's say on the way home from work I flip off another driver off who is blocking my way on the freeway - then, a little later, I catch myself fantasizing about a female colleague at the office.  I then get home from work and take a phone call from a friend who asks me how I've been doing.  I think to myself how much I want to work up the courage to share the great work Christ has been performing in my life.  I want to tell him how fulfilling church has become to me lately.  I want to share all of this with my buddy, yet I know I just committed road rage on the way home while mentally defiling a female colleague who isn't my wife.  So the moral dilemma is...Should I keep my faith to myself for fear of becoming a hypocrite?  Or should I share my good news?  How would Jesus advise me?      Well, I think the answer is obvious - Jesus would want me to share the good news.  I serve the Lord much better by sharing his good work, so that my friend might find his own way to Christ's mercy - an in addition, so that my own faith and journey to becoming a more perfect Christian is strengthened.  Of course, I am not off the hook for my behavior earlier in the day - not at all.  Additionally, if I were to have told my friend how perfectly I'd been behaving since growing closer to the Lord...well then the ""hypocrite"" label would surely apply to me.  But the simple act of sharing Christ's good news with my friend, one sinner to another, was the best thing I could have done that day - especially given my poor behavior on the way home from work.     There are many in society who believe in moral relativism.  They believe values are conditional for each individual and culture.  They don't believe in truths, and they don't believe in a God that would speak in truths and absolutes.  In fact, they believe religious people - those that follow a biblical-based denomination (as opposed to a new-age offshoot) - are backwards, weakminded, and old fashioned.  Why?...Well, I will explore this topic in another post, but for now just take my word for it.     Don't listen to these knuckleheads.  We do not have to be perfect to talk about Jesus.  In fact, Christ asks us to tell others about him - he doesn't want bystanders, he wants participatory Christians.  He wants us talking and communicating with one another about his church.  He wants us to have a sense of urgency about how much time we have on this earth to straighten out our lives.  He doesn't want you sitting on the sidelines waiting for the magical day you suddenly become perfect enough to talk about him.  After all,  he came here for the imperfect people.   His disciples were imperfect people.  King David, one of the most celebrated figures in the bible, committed several notorious sins.       Once I was in confession telling a priest how I felt unworthy to participate in the service because of how poorly I had been leading my life.  The priest looked me dead in the eye and told me that I'm a tough case, and that Jesus likes the tough cases - the hard ones.  I have to tell you that hearing him say that made me feel so good.  It gave me hope.  Jesus told us that the heart of the law is mercy.  He came here to change the hearts of the people that keep messing up - the cheats, the adulters, the liars, the assholes, etc., so if that's you - if you're a ""hard case"" - then you're exactly who Christ wants in his church.  He probably figures if he can win you over then you're likely to bring in more just like you, and his church will grow.        Don't worry about what modern society deems appropriate.  Many (perhaps, most) of Jesus' teachings run counter to the values of modern society anyway.  In these instances, they would have you be quiet so as not to pass moral judgment over others.  But that's not want Jesus wants.  He wants us to stand up for the truth - not to condemn others, but to spread his word no matter who it offends.  He wants us to come to church regardless of how perfect we've behaved the week prior.  He wants us to share our religious feelings with others even if we don't have it all worked out ourself.  I am, myself, a chronic sinner.  This blog is my way of connecting with my faith and understanding my own belief system in spite of my chronic sinning.  I ask that God give me the strength to resist modern society's attempt to shove me into the closet.  I know that the only way I can become a better Christian is to talk about my faith, damn modern society's labels.",male,33,Advertising,Gemini,0
174402,3839660,2004-07-04,"Welcome to my blog.  Jesus once said to his disciples  ""be perfect, like your father in heaven is perfect.""   Yet they weren't living in 21st century society, a system that by any standard undermines faith values much more than it supports them.  Religious principles are simply not discussed in most social settings.  They are almost anathema in professional environments.  In fact, the very act of religious conversation makes many (if not most) uncomfortable - myself included.  It seems too personal or serious during most occasions - an intrusion into our private self.  Jesus keeps getting shoved deeper and deeper into the closet.  We let him out when socially acceptable...such as at mass, or alone in our thoughts - what amounts to a few hours (maybe) during one's week.     Yet, most of us allow SOCIETY'S values to dominate our conversation and thinking throughout the week: sex, money, success, power.  We freely talk about them  everywhere  and at  anytime .  Society's values rarely make us feel uncomfortable.  They pervade our homes, our workplaces, our schools, and most of our social occasions.  They are reinforced on television, radio and on the internet.  They make Christianity seem so far out of modern context that it feels natural to sweep the cross under the rug for all but a few hours of the week.  Once more, certain societal opinion-makers actually go so far as to ridicule or put down faith values AND those who espouse them, calling them narrow-minded, or simplistic, or unsophisticated, or at times even bigoted or hypocritical.  The very act of standing up for Christ is, in their view, wrong and harmful.  Is it any wonder why the world seems so twisted and confusing at times?  Intolerance of Christ's teachings has cast a shadow over us all, and the downward spiral of indignity and inhumanity in today's society reflects this.  It's time for us all to collectively step back from the brink and assume some spiritual leadership over our lives, our families, our communities and our church.  I am 33 years old and I've let society drive a wedge between myself and Christ.  I'll get into the reasons in further posts, but the fact remains that I have been spiritually bankrupt most of my adult life.  I have not been able to get any sustained, spiritual traction.  I don't blame it all on society, but society sure made it easier to hide Jesus in the closet.  This blog is intended to be a tool for me to bring Jesus back out and into my public life.  Jesus told us that those who are embarrassed of him in this life will share the reverse fate in the afterlife.  How could I let 33 years go by embarrassed of Christ?  This blog will hopefully be the start of the coming-out party.  Along the way I will share with you my thoughts on the lessons I have learned on the road to being a true Christian in the modern era.  I am hoping this will be both therapeutic, educational and spiritually uplifting for me - perhaps it will also be helpful for others to witness.  And as I share my thoughts about Christ in the virtual world, may Jesus give me the courage to let him out of the closet in the real world.  On another note, I am going to talk candidly in my blog.  In many ways, modern society is an enemy to the practicing Christian - and when battling any enemy, a key rule of thumb is to know how the adversary thinks and behaves.  In other words, I have to get real.  I can't discuss the pitfalls of 21st century societal values without, at times, getting very graphic and specific about all of its tests.  I think a weakness of many of today's preachers is their inability, or unwillingness, to get down into the trenches of modern sin and temptation by talking its language.  But this is where the battle is being waged for the hearts and souls of the 21st century Christian.  So that is where I will go, regardless of the topic.  Please know this about my blog.  Lastly, I dedicate this blog to the Lord Jesus Christ, my personal savior.  It is open to all who know and love Christ, regardless of denomination, and especially regardless of how imperfect you are as a Christian.  God sent his only son to heal the morally sick, not the morally perfect.  If you fall well short of Christ's standards on a daily basis, you will be in good company here.  My goal is that the Holy Spirit will work through me on this site.  My blog, as is my life, will be in his steady hands.  God Bless.",male,33,Advertising,Gemini,0
174403,3839660,2004-08-10,"As I have mentioned previously, I have had a long-standing struggle coming to terms with my own faith. At various interludes in my life I have ""dabbled"" in Christianity. I surely have never been closer to Christ than I was as a child, when I read the bible and prayed nightly. At the time I could not appreciate the innocence of my relationship. As a 33 year old I still crave the purity and simplicity of that connection I had with Jesus. I prayed to him like he was my father, best friend, and creator all rolled into one being. I felt his spiritual presence in a manner that still alludes me to this day.  That all ended when I reached 15 or 16 years old when I began putting Christ on the backburner. Part of my motivation for this boiled down to a desire to be cool and increase my social acceptance. To this end I viewed my close, personal relationship with Christ as baggage - literally, I felt it was holding me back. Additionally, this was the age were I began connecting with my inner desire to conquest the female gender romantically and sexually. It began to override my Christian sensibilities as I thought about sex and girls nearly around the clock. I couldn't envision these feelings coexisting with my close relationship with Jesus. Nearly overnight he began losing relevance in my life.  From age 15/16, through high school graduation and into college, I barely paid lip service to Christ. Even as an adult I was preoccupied with the goals of being cool and ""hooking up"" with women. Jesus was completely on the backburner at this juncture. I attended church ever so often - typically on religious holidays with my parents. I led a sinful and gluttonous lifestyle that drove a wedge between myself and my faith - a barrier of my own making. I rationalized this barrier by declaring myself unfit for Christ... that I was unworthy of a relationship with him. I believed that my very presence in his church was hypocritical and insulting, given my past behavior and unwillingness to immediately repent and change my ways. I substituted a relationship with Jesus with guilt over my lapsed faith, yet all along I believed that he would be there for me when I was ready. I knew it was wrong to feel this way - that there were no guarantees that I would be around long enough on this earth to engage Christ on my own timetable. Yet I did it anyway.  After college I attempted a reconciliation with Jesus, which lasted about 4-6 months, after which I proceeded to return to my previous behavior (with a vengeance I might add). It wasn't until about 26/27 when I began backing off from my wilder ways, seeking a more adult pattern of behavior for myself that included a search for a more serious female companion. In addition, this was the age where I began searching for the religious path that I had abandoned so many years before, attempting to pick up the pieces of my faith. I found out that it wasn't that easy.  Old habits are hard to break. I had not gone to church on Sundays since leaving home for college at 18. I had conditioned myself to thinking of God only when I was troubled. I had conditioned myself into taking my very soul for granted, gambling that I would still be around years later to repair the damage. I had poor moral hygiene - I was used to doing as I pleased. I had also lost any shred of the spiritual intimacy I had once felt with Christ. Like all relationships, they grow stronger with the investment of time and effort, and grow weaker with neglect. I woke up at age 27 with the inability to put one foot in front of the other from a religious standpoint. I didn't even know where to begin, and I continued to let bouts with temptation and sin estrange me from Jesus. I stumbled and bumbled my way into my 30's.  After 15 years of weakness, indifference and stupidity, I am putting back the pieces. Along the way I have uncovered some truths about this process. For starters, I've learned that sin and temptation are prisons of our own creation. Jesus rightfully condemns behavior detrimental to the soul, including sexual dalliances. But part of the reason Jesus hates sin so much is because it drives a wedge between human beings and his mercy - often by our own choosing. Like a fool, I conned MYSELF (no doubt, with the help of the devil himself) into believing that I should stay away from Christ until which time I was more worthy of his grace. I was literally in a prison of my own creation, allowing sin to stand like jail bars in the way of my reaching the one thing that could help set me free - a relationship with Jesus.  I finally asked a priest about my theory of ""unworthiness"" within the state of sin. He stated that although Jesus hated the sin, he would NEVER want it to prevent me from coming to him.  He told me there was healing power to be accessed at church - as a Catholic, he specifically cited the sacrament of communion as a channel that Jesus could use to reach me. He also reminded me of something I knew as a child - that the heart of the law of God is mercy. Jesus came here to earth not to condemn but to save. He dined with tax collectors and prostitutes. I was right in one aspect - that Jesus would be here waiting for me because he has loved me since before I was ever conceived. Guilt is not a sufficient replacement for a relationship with Jesus. Guilt will not get you into heaven. Jesus wanted me in church in spite of my sinful ways so he could reach me in a manner of his choosing. Yet I felt I knew better. I stayed away and waited until my late 20s, wasting a portion of my life.  Today, I am a committed husband, and a struggling, yet determined, Christian. I will never let sin stand in the way of being in God's presence again. Yet I still deal with temptation... sexually and otherwise. I believe that this is one of the challenges Jesus has given me. He knows how I think and he knows what motivates me. I believe he expects me to exert my willpower and resist it. At the same time he is calling me to worship him, to help grow the family of believers, and to administer to those less fortunate. Along the path he will give me the tools that I need to fight my temptations and improve as a person. There is nothing for me to be embarrassed about and certainly nothing that ought to keep me away from his mercy. Temptations and sin are a part of everyone's life. We are obligated to carry them like a cross and move forward on the path.",male,33,Advertising,Gemini,0

We visited the Animal Shelter  (url: http://www.nashelter.org) H indicated that he would like to volunteer. He was eager to help out, and even picked up a mop and helped mop the floor!  After that we walked one of the dogs, Danny. The visit was cut short because the Animal Control Officer had to go out on a call, but we agreed to go back in 2 weeks and visit/volunteer again.  AFTERNOON 12 NOON TO 5:00 PM We walked at a local nature trail/fish hatchery.  H was upset because we forgot the bug spray, but walked the nature trail anyway.

He was unhappy to learn the parental controls on the TV block pg13 movies, he spent some time trying (unsuccessfully) to figure out how unlock the code. I told him PG13 movies have to be evaluated individually for content. He argued that he was old enough to watch PG13 movies; I reiterated 11 is not old enough for a movie rated for a 13 year old without supervision.   EVENING 5:00 PM TO 11:00 PM While packing to leave H jumped up on the top bunk and broke one of the slats on the bed.  He prefers to sleep on the top bunk and argued when told heâd have to use the bottom bunk until we get the top bunk fixed.  He insisted that he canât sleep on the bottom bunk, and how horrible it is.  He refused to accept that he should not sleep on the bunk with a broken slat.   Next weekend we will work on ways to fix the bed, and reasons why it isnât appropriate to jump on the bed (i.e. safety, appropriate behavior, respect for property)   Summary:  H has a very positive attitude, and is always eager to help.  He can be stubborn at times, but usually listens to reasonable explanations.  He participates in all planned activities, and enjoys making future plans.

NOTE: As we walked to the library he tried repeatedly to get me to let him use a path through nearby trees to âsee what was there.â  I suspected there was a reason he wanted to go down this path, and later found out that he believes that the path leads to the backyard of his former pre-adoptive family.  Due to the details he gave, I believe his previous family lives approx 3 blocks away.  I talked to him about respecting their privacy and keeping appropriate boundaries, and he agreed not to go there again.  I suspect curiosity will eventually get the better of him.   We had a cook out with my son & his family.  He talked sports with my bio-son, and everything went smoothly.  He helped me set the table, and helped clean up afterwards.   We had a very nice day, and he was falling asleep in the car on the way back.  He was dropped off back at his temp rez House @ 7PM  We agreed that next weekend we would have an overnight visit.  I will be picking Him up around 10:00 Sat. morning and return around 6PM Sunday night.",female,46,Non-Profit,Scorpio,1

We spent the rest of the night watching TV and doing crafts.   EVENING 5:00 PM TO 11:00 PM H woke up in the middle of the night and stated he had a bad dream.  He claimed that a man came in the house and said he needed some of Hâs underclothes (H just got new socks and underwear.)  He went on to say the man went into the kitchen and started taking food.  H claims that in his dream he told the man to, âget the f***â out of the house.â  In the morning H thought that talking me was a part of the He dream.  In fact, he was sitting up in bed, eyes open, and speaking very clearly.   H has some general fears about going to bed. He always insists that the lights be on, and the door be wide open.  I have been working on reassuring him that this is a safe place for him, and he need not be scared.

186508,4032401,2004-07-30,"Well I headlined at Rooster T Feathers Comedy Club in Sunnyvale, CA.  For those who don't know about Rooster's, it's a very nice club in Silicon Valley that caters to the Silicon Valley type, ie white and Indian.  This is perhaps one of the hardest clubs I've ever performed at.  For some reason, I do decent to well there, however, I don't KILL.  I hate not being able to KILL at a place.  And I can't figure the audience out.  They will laugh at stupid stuff and other comedians who are ok, but when I go up there they act like I'm going to rob them.  I don't want to call the audience stupid, but they should know that I would only rob them in the parking lot, not in the actual club where I'm trying to get work at.   I hate not being able to figure an audience out.  Usually you can feel them out and know if they want clean, dirty, political, sexual, racial, etc type of humor.  Well I decided that since it was a white audience to try and be clean with as little sexual humor and cussing as possible.  Other comedians before me did well and were alot more dirty than I was.  So I'm on stage and my first bit, which is one of my very best bits because it always does well, it's like one of my aces in my deck of cards, well it doesn't do very well.  I tend to tell stories that unfold and have punchlines throughout.  This place decides to wait till the very last punchline before deciding whether they will laugh or stare at you and make you feel like kicking them.  This is hard when you do long bits, because you rely on the laughter to build up to the end and keep momentum going.  Silence is not a very good confidence booster on stage.  Luckily, I get them going pretty well with my college material, weight bits, and disney and internet gangs.  The racial jokes for the most part do well, except for when I do a bit referring to white people being more likely to have incest, which I totally understand.  I do it more for my benefit then theirs.   What sucks the most is that I don't think the owner of the club stayed for any if not the first few minutes of my set.  I did this set in order for her to see me perform live and decide whether to book me or not.  If she only saw my bomb the first joke, then I'm done there.  I didn't see her after my set so I went home with my tail inbetween my legs (I have a really long butt).  I figure if she emails me and wants to book me then cool, and if not, then oh well.  This club's crowd may not be the crowd for me.  They seem to enjoy more of the, how should I put it, ""White"" comedians like Gary Shandling.  I think the only non-white comedian picture they had on the wall was Margeret Cho.   So I bid farewell to Rooster T Feathers and it's cracker-fest.  I guess I'll stick to the clubs that have that certain element I like to call minorities.  Actually, what gets me is that I usually do very well in front of white people.  Its just THESE white people who get don't get me :(  Maybe I should write more puns and analogy's for jokes so they can be pleased.  Actually I think I'm going to start focusing on my acting more than my comedy.  At least for now while I'm in the bay area.  For comedy I will do showcases to keep fresh and competitions and festivals.  As far as getting booked,  my main booker doesnt seem to want to book me anymore seeing as how I haven't heard from him in 2 months and can't get him to take or return my phone calls or emails.  Oh well, it's his loss...right?  *sniff* Please take me back booker.  Well acting is paying more than comedy ever will right now, so I'm happy as long as I got something good going on.  If you read this, sorry it wasn't very funny, I just felt like venting and I was trying to not cuss in case my mom reads it or something.",male,23,Arts,Aquarius,0
186509,4032401,2004-07-28,"Well today I wanted to talk about a couple of things: how my commercial shoot went and how my comedy show went last night.  For some reason, my body likes to mess with me.  I think it's self-destructive, because whenever I get a big gig something happens.  When I did my PlaysStation 2 commercial, the night before I started to lose my voice.  I barely made it through the shoot with the little bit of voice I had.  I had that deep, sexy voice, it was sexy except for every 2 minutes when I had to make that ugly clearing your throat noise.  So I get booked on Friday for this Battlefront commercial that shoots on Monday.  And out of nowhere this gigantic pimple erupts onto the side of my nose.  This is my self-destructive body going to work, because I never get pimples on my nose, and never that big.  This thing looked like a colony had formed.  When I get pimples it's where my facial hair grows as a result of ingrown hairs.  So I am freaking out because I can picture myself showing up and they look at my pimple and are like, yeah, we can't use you in the commercial with that thing on your face.  But the shoot takes place at this ILM studio which is owned by LucasArts and does the special effects and art for hundreds of movies including Star Wars.  So I'm thinking that they can CGI it off my face or make it turn into an ewok or something.  Fortunately, this was a big time shoot, so they had a professional make-up artist there who went to work on it and miraculously made it disappear under 20 coats of makeup.  So the pimple was handled.  Now the shoot was great, and the people from the ad agency and crew were awesome.  It is amazing to see the crew create completely different sets between shots.  Every scene was shot on a greenscreen so that they can add us into the actual Star Wars movie.  The commercial is to show how realistic the game is to the movie and as a result you feel like you in the movie, so it has 6 of us normal people running in scenes from the movie.  There will be 2 commercials made from the shoot and I'll either be running through snow after a stormtrooper or shooting in a jungle at some ewoks.  It was some oscarworthy performances I must say.  So it was a 12 hour shoot which means overtime and some extra cha-ching.  I hate when actors talk about how they have 15 hour days on sets, etc and how its a lot of work.  I did a 12 hour day and did probably 30 minutes of work at the beginning of the day and 10 minutes of work at the end of the day.  In between I chilled and read magazines, took naps, played videogames, read the bible and the koran and then did a comparison essay, so much was accomplished.  I love acting and would probably prefer to act than do comedy full-time.  The money is a lot better and you get treated like a king as opposed to shit in comedy rooms.    Now last night I performed at the Avalon Club in Santa Clara as part of a comedy competition.  This was the second and last week of the ""Pre-Finals"" stage.  Yeah, have you ever heard of a competition with ""PREFINALS"".  I haven't till now.  The competition seems to have lasted about 6 months so it is good to finally be at the end.  I killed that night and will be going to court later this month for first degree...hehehehehe...no.  But I did do very well and placed first out of the five people selected to advance to the finals which will take place this upcoming Tuesday.  Hopefully I win, because otherwise I'd be a loser.  Plus the prize is $1,500 and thats a lot of pokemon cards I can buy with that kind of scratch.  Scratch?  I sound like I'm from the 50's.  So, seeing as how the competition has been dragged out so long, I think that if I win the finals then they'll probably make me advance to the post finals or something.    Well tonight I will be headlining a showcase at Rooster T Feathers in Sunnyvale.  I'm looking forward to it, because if I want to get booked there then I need to do well.  When I sent the owner my tape she said that it wasn't very funny and she didn't hear many laughs.  Which is crazy, because I personally dubbed in a laugh track.  (It's hard to get an audience to come and watch you perform in your living room.)  So once again I will have to jump through some hoops like the good little comedian I am and prove myself to people, club by club.  With my luck there will be only 5 people in the audience and they'll be the waitresses wondering where the hell they went wrong in life to end up serving at a empty club on a wed night.  I'll let you know how it goes...",male,23,Arts,Aquarius,0
186510,4032401,2004-07-25,"This is great.  I finally have a blogger thing.  Now all you people out there can really get to know me deeper than what you can get from my website.  The first thing I want to talk about is my new commercial that I landed.  It's for Star Wars: Battlefront, which I hear is a new videogame that will be coming out on PC, XBOX and PS2.  I'm excited because it's a national commercial that will be played on Cable, Network and in foreign markets.  Plus it's a funny commercial, which hopefully will mean more airtime and MONEY!  This is my second national commercial in the past 2 months.  My last commercial was for PS2 Online.  The videogame industry is being very generous to me lately, which works for me since I've spent hundreds of dollars on videogames and PS2 stuff.  So it's time I got my money back.  The audition for the commercial was great.  I showed up and read the sides and it said that one of the characters was obviously out-of-shape, which is PC for obviously fat.  I knew my chances of getting the commercial just went up 50%.  Usually when I audition for stuff, I try and look as thin as possible, wearing loose shirts and blankets, etc.  Having lost 50 pounds in the past year (Thank you ATKINS), I was worried that I would come across as too anorexic on camera with my 260+ pound body.  So when I read the script I tore off my lose shirt and auditioned in my thin, belly hugging undershirt.  And in auditions they make you do a profile shots where you face the camera then turn to the left and then the right, very similar to a prison line-up where they make you do your profiles.  I don't know if they make everyone do this at an audition or if they did this especially for me to make me feel more at home.  But as I did my profiles, I made sure to try and stick out my stomach to appear as much as Buddha as possible.  Apparantly it worked because I landed the role later that week.  The only bad part is that I was suppose to go down to LA and perform at the Conga Room the same day as the commercial shoot (which is Monday, July 26th).  The show is for consideration to be in this new documentary on latino stand up comedians, called ""standUP"".  Unfortunately, I had to cancel.  Hopefully I can reschedule for the following Monday.  Well this is my first Blog.  I like this.  I will try and post stuff alot and hopefully someone will eventually read it.",male,23,Arts,Aquarius,0
186511,4032401,2004-08-15,"So Murphy's Law hit me again. For those of you who don't know what Murphy's Law is, please turn off the computer and go get your GED.  So I had a commercial shoot this Saturday for CISCO Systems. And of course, Friday morning I get sick and throw up. Now, when I throw up, it's not a normal reguritating. I retch with all my might and so when I do, all of the capillaries in my forehead and around my eyes bust. So by the time I'm done, I look like a raccoon who has been beaten with a stick. Once again, before a shoot, whatever can go wrong does go wrong. Before my Playstation commercial, I began losing my voice and barely had enough to spout out the monologue. Before my Star Wars commercial, I got a huge pimple on my nose, a place I never get pimples.  So now I'm spending all of Friday with an Ice Mask on my face looking like a gay Zorro. I'm freaking out, because I can imagine showing up to the shoot and them looking at my face and telling me that I can't do the commercial, because they aren't advertising UGLY.  So Saturday morning I arrive on set at 10:30 AM. Fortunately a lot of the redness has gone down, but it's still visible. The costume designer, Christine, was awesome and relieved my fears by telling me that they have a make-up person to do make-up (duh, what else would they do with that title). I let out a big sigh of relief and a little fart, which made Christine giggle and then gag. The make-up artist caked a layer of make-up on my face and made me pretty. Having all that make-up on, I wish I had my gay Zorro ice mask, because I would have been a hit in San Francisco. I shouldn't have worried about my face though, because if Edward James Olmos can do acting with those huge acne potholes in his face, then they should be able to take care of little blemishes.  It was a long, hard day of work on the set. I got into my security costume and sat around for about 30 minutes. Then I spent 2 minutes signing contracts and then sat around for 30 more minutes, reading my FHM magazine, playing Gameboy, doing mathematical formulas and coming up with a cure for Cancer. I was then summoned onto set to do my first scene.  My first scene was very complicated and required true acting training. I stood behind the security desk and as another actress walked by and delivered her line, she looked at me when she said ""security"" and I nodded at her as she continued to walk by. Now to you people who aren't in the ""biz,"" you probably think that this is an easy task. But you don't realize how many things I have to take into consideration while ""acting"". I have to develop a character. Am I a happy security guard or am I pissed off? Is it a polite nod, or is it a sexual nod? Do I nod and then continue to look outside or do I nod, lick my lips and then continue to stare at her as she walks away looking at her butt. See, acting is so complicated.  My next scene was a close up of me standing behind the security desk. This time I would spout out a few short lines and they will use one of them in the commerical. Some lines include ""more security"" ""more voice"" ""more reliability"" ""more protection"" ""more inside"". So I say these lines over and over using different inflections in my voice. One time I'll be like ""more security"" saying it like a question, and the next time I'll be saying ""more security"" as if I'm demanding it. It's great skill to do this and according to the crew, ""I was brilliant"" and ""could use some deoderant"".  So after about 30 minutes of shooting we wrap the scene and eat lunch which was Italian from a restuarant that I assume is Italian as well. I could have left after my scene, however, I never turn down a free meal because I'm cheap and poor...and Mexican, and we all know minorities don't turn down free food.  After lunch, I gathered my stuff and said my goodbye's. It was 12:30 pm. A whole 2 hour day of shooting. I love the life of an actor. In those two hours I'll make what I make in 2 weeks at my part-time job at the blood bank or in 20 hours of working as a rodeo clown.  So the commercial will be played live on the Cisco website on September 14th at 8:00 AM Pacific time. People world wide will be able to see me as a security guard. The website is  urlLink www.cisco.com/go/isr   You have to register on the site in order to view the wesbcast, which is free to register. So if you want to look at it, log on around 7:30 so you can register. The commercial is to advertise some big time product that Cisco is releasing. And that was my big day on the Cisco Commercial Shoot.",male,23,Arts,Aquarius,0
186512,4032401,2004-08-11,"So, I know that I said in my last post last week that I would write what happened in the Avalon Competition that I was in.  Well, I wanted to wait till I got paid before I said anything.  I got paid my $200 prize yesterday, so here it goes.  The Avalon Competition is a big piece of crooked crap.  I rocked the finals and it was obvious to everyone that I should have came in first place, second place at the very least.  On the ""judges"" scorecards, I was tied for first place with the other two comics who placed, yet somehow I mysteriously placed in third.  On the three scorecards, I came in first place on one, second place on another and third place on the last one.  That averages out to second place.  How the hell did I come in third you may ask?  Cuz the freakin competition is ghetto and poorly ran.  The owner of the club and host of the competition went in with the judges when told it was a tie and manipluated them into picking their two favorite comics.  After the show, when the host was talking to the three of us, the owner even came up and told the other two that they were his favorite comics and that he knew they would win when he first saw them perform.  Then this Indian douche looked at me and told me that he had never seen me perform till tonight.   Now I may sound bitter, but if hoping that a club and the owner become bankrupt and have to sell the ghetto club again to new management or that the club burns down to the ground is bitter, then call me bitter.  The owner even looks like a slimeball with his long greesy hair and attitude.  I hope he gets stuck in the worse part of Oakland during a riot, then he'll see how tough he really is in the real world.  And the host was horrible.  He sucks as a wannabe comedian and only hosts because he works for the club.  He is not funny, never starts the show on time and does wayyyy too much time in between comics.  He thinks he's funny, but he just annoys and pisses off everyone in the audience.  Ok, the problem I had with the competition is that they pick three random people from the audience to judge.  They put the fate of $1500 in the hands of three people who know nothing about comedy.  They have no idea which comedians are doing hack or original material.  They don't understand about comedic timing or creativity.  Would it be so hard to get three real judges who actually know something about comedy to judge?  Plus, audiences are stupid and lose objectivity.  The guy who goes last is the one that they all remember and if he does well, then they forget about those who went second or first.   So who won?  Surprise surprise, the guy who went last won.  The guy is a great guy, an old guy who audiences like because he's an old guy who talks about being old, smoking weed, etc etc.  *sarcasm coming up* It's funny though because he has great delivery and well it's funny to see old people talk about sex and weed I guess.  He is my nemesis because he beat me in another competition as well, where he performed last and the audience voted.  I wish I could hate him, but he's a nice guy.  He should have came in third place in my opinion.  The guy who came in second came out of nowhere.  People believed it would be between me, this other guy named Slappy and the guy who came in first.  Nobody had this guy ranked in the top three, except for the stupid judges and owner of the club.  This guy has a dating show on UPN that is pretty new.  His act consists mostly of impersonations.  I believe he ended with impersonations of Arnold Schwartznegger, Jack Nicholson, and Keanu Reeves.  Real original stuff ;)  *wink sarcastic wink*  but audiences love impersonations.  What can I say, you guys are monkeys and impersonations are like bananas cuz it doesn't require you to think.  Now dance monkeys dance.  I feel bad for Slappy, because he should have came in second or third at least, but ended up not even placing.  Of course, he won't say anything because he doesn't want to piss anyone off or burn bridges.  He even congratulated us on the SFComedy Board.  I on the other hand, don't care what bridges I burn in comedy, because there are no bridges in San Francisco, which is why I'm getting tired of having to deal with small time bookers and clubs who think they are big time.  If I had any bridges to burn, then I would be getting gigs and not wasting time in retarded competitions.  Plus this is my blog and I'll rant and rave about what I want since I know nobody but my homeboy in Iraq reads this because he does nothing else but sit on his ass and hide from his boss so he doesnt have to work.  Haha, be safe Kiyo and holla at ya boy!  So I am done with these whack, poorly ran competitions...  Well, actually I did enter another one yesterday.  I am now in the San Jose Improv Battle of the Bay competition.  I did a prelim yesterday and advanced to the quarterfinals.  Honestly, I could have cared less about this competition.  The only reason I did it was because they cancelled the Wednesday showcases there and I needed to get up and remind the guy who books the club who I am so that he'll continue booking me and remember to call me, since he hasn't called in quite awhile.  Fortunately, he caught my set and we talked afterwards and hopefully he'll call.  Otherwise I will continue to stalk him and put horse heads in his bed.  The prelims and quarterfinals are judged by the dreaded audience.  Therefore, whoever has the most friends in the audience wins.  Hence me coming in second place with zero friends in the audience and the guy who placed first being the guy who brought half the audience.  The guy who came in third brought the other half of the audience.  Both of them sucked of course, but what can you do.  My homeboy Tyson should have placed, but he doesn't have friends either and went up early so was forgotten by the end.  If I dont advance it is no big deal and I refuse to let any friends come to the show for the first two rounds when it's audience votes, because I want to advance through impressing strangers.  The semifinals and finals have real judges, so they can come then if they want.   What else is happening?  I will be joining the Screen Actors Guild this upcoming week.  A nice $1453 dent in my pocket.  I did get booked for an industrial film to be shot this Saturday for Cisco Systems, a computer company.  An industrial film are those horrible films that you watch when you get hired at a company.  All of the ones I've seen have terrible acting, so I'm not too worried about my performance.  The industrials I have seen are ones that are about sexual harrassment, etc.  Maybe I'll get lucky will be able to grab someone's ass or something.  I didn't even audition for the part, I was booked off of my headshot, so that was nice because I wasn't expecting it.  Of course my headshot was from when I was 18, so they will have a nice surprise when they see a 50 pound heavier version of me.  And I play a security guard.  I'm quite experienced in this role having worked 2 summers as a security before while in college.  So I guess my life has come full circle from security guard back to security guard (sigh) how sad.  Oh well, money is money and work is work.   Whew, i'm tired from this ranting.  I need to post more so that I can get it out as it happens and don't have it all bottled up.  Oh well, it gives you people something to read if your interested in my life.",male,23,Arts,Aquarius,0
186513,4032401,2004-08-02,"Well, today was a great day. I received two, count them TWO gig offers. The first gig was from my booker's company, GFI Entertainment, not Jimmy, who is my main booker, but his parter who does colleges called and offered me a gig in October at Chico State University.  Chico State has a special place in my heart because it was my very first paid college gig and my very first gig with GFI or any booker for that matter. It was the fall of 2001 and I was an emcee doing a show with Shang Forbes and Andrew Norelli, both of whom are good friends of mine now. It was a great show and I did well despite being nervous because this was my first big gig. I was even on the poster, which I thought was the tightest thing ever. My mexican side came out, because I stole a poster to bring home and still have it framed in my room (framing it must come from my white side). Plus I got paid $300 to do 15 minutes. So now I'm thinking, damn, comedy pays really well. This is my first gig and I'm already making $300/night. Of course, I quickly learned that most of my other gigs don't pay nearly this much. Most clubs, not all clubs, but most pay lousy.  They usually pay me in cheddar cheese and bubble gum.  It's the college and corporate gigs that pay the big dinero (that means money in Spanish, geez go to McDonalds sometime and learn some Spanish will ya).  Chico State is also a lot of fun. They have this reputation as a party school, and well...it's a well deserved reputation because they know how to have fun. And when you're out in Chico, CA, I guess there isn't much else to do but party and drink. Chico isn't going to be a big museum and arts place like SF unless all the cows start painting. So Chico is fun, I met alot of cool people there. It's always a nice place when white girls will come up and talk to me. Alot of times they get intimidated around me, or at least until I take my ski mask off.  I'm working on a parody of the Usher song Burn to do. Maybe I can get it polished and bust it out in Chico. Basically the song talks about Burning from Herpes.  The second phone call I received was from the San Diego Comedy Festival. They wanted to know if I would like to perform this week in it. Usually I would have jumped at this chance, because there is a lot of prize money at stake and one can never see too many donkey shows in Tijuana. However, this time I have to say no, because my little brother flies in tomorrow for the week, so I can't drag him down to San Diego. I have to stay here and make him dance for money at Pier 39 in SF. People love when I stand behind him and shout out ""Dance monkey, Dance!"" while he pops and locks.  But he gets a $1 burger after he puts in his 8 hours, so that should keep him happy.  But back to San Diego. They must be hurting for comedians, because I only sent in a registration. I didn't follow up with a press kit because they require a $25 fee and I didn't have $25 to spend. I think we can all agree that midget hookers aren't as cheap as they used to be. They are in high demand these days apparently. So they must be taking anyone, which sucks because that means the competition must not be as tough, making my chance at winning higher.  Tomorrow night is the finals of this Avalon Bay Area Competition that I'm in. I'll keep notes on the other comics and write up an evaluation of the night. It'll either be very positive or very negative, depending on if I win or not. There is $1500 at stake for first place, so I have to bust out the gut buster jokes...well i guess I should write some gut busters first so I can bust them out (HEHEHEHEHE) -imagine me squeeling like a little girl. I have some nice chuckle jokes and jokes that make you go ""Ahh, that's very true. This gentleman on stage has a good point. Not funny, but true nonetheless. Where's the waitress? I'm could use another drink. Don't tell me I don't need another drink! You're not my mother!... Don't touch me. (burp) I have to go pee. I'll be back."" (HEHEHEHEHEHE)",male,23,Arts,Aquarius,0

I think we all feel that way. When your clients are developers, you are dealing with people that have huge sums of money invested in land. They are banking on developing that land. In the meanwhile, they may have more than $1 million on acreage, which they have loans on and are paying large monthly interest payments. They really do need those parcels developed, sooner rather than later. Of course, I work in a county that has a very large ""no-growth"" contingent in office because they are fearful of the area looking like the neighboring county to the east, and it is the fastest growing county in Virginia and one of the fastest in the country. So you have opposing viewpoints. The developers believe that the County is deliberately holding them back and the County believes it is just trying to keep up with the development applications they get on a daily basis. I think it's somewhere in between. I think that the developers forget that they are not the only people building on open land and the County, even if they don't overtly intend to, take too damn long to review documents. They have a luxury I don't have. My clients would be furious if I told them I'd take 6 weeks to review things for them. The County says ""you want it approved? Six weeks."" Sometimes they don't get things done in a timely fashion and then the client gets pissed off and wants us to yell at the County. Lot of good that does. ""Fine, you want it back now? Not approved."" So we avoid that scenario since that means another 6 week review process generally. Some days it's rather frustrating because frankly, the clients can be a bunch of prima donnas. Like the client that hung the phone up so forcefully the other day, it was really like he hung up ON me. He was here today, everything's cool, but at the time, it really did hurt my ear. Not to mention, ruffle my feathers a bit.  So, I'm glad it's Friday and that I don't have to deal with this shit for a few days. I'll go home and deal with home improvement instead.",female,43,indUnk,Capricorn,1

I'm seriously due for a long yoga session. In the meantime, I found this article on  urlLink http://www.fitnessmagazine.com  and from what I've read, it's true and I need to remind myself of it. I won't go into a tirade about my thoughts on low-carb. My own thing about low-sugar has more to do with the diabetic genetics in my family than a diet craze. When your mother is a diabetic, and her father was, and his father, brothers and so on, you take the threat seriously. I have a big sweet tooth, so if I find a product made with Splenda that I like, I buy it and use it. Every little bit. Recently, I bought some grapes that have been so sweet, they rival any candybar. So here's the article:     10 Diet Lessons From the FrenchSay oui to Brie! Brie has 95 calories an ounce, compared to 114 for cheddar .  By Anne Marie O'Connor     1. Petite isn't just a dress size . One of the reasons France has an 11 percent obesity rate (as compared to America's 33 percent) is portion control. ""A croissant in Paris is one ounce, while in Pittsburgh it's two,"" notes Chris Rosenbloom, Ph.D., R.D., a professor of nutrition at Georgia State University. Buy one and share it with your beau.   2. Never say diet . The French don't get involved in the carbs versus protein debate, nor do they label food groups like dairy or beef ""bad."" ""There's an emphasis on eating a wide variety of foods-fruits, vegetables, beef, poultry, fish, bread and cheese-without overdoing any one thing,"" explains Susan Herrmann Loomis, a cooking teacher in Louviers, France, and author of the cooking memoir  On Rue Tatin  (Broadway Books, 2001).   3. There's no French equivalent of Butter Buds . Most French regard processed foods with the utter disdain they usually reserve for instant coffee. In other words, they'd rather have a small piece of ""real"" chocolate than a big slab of some low-fat chocolate dessert. The fact is, the sugar calories in low-fat sweets probably negate any fat grams saved-which won't get you any closer to fitting into those YSL jeans.   4. Snacking is a faux pas . They rarely snack, and they eat meals only while sitting at a table. Americans, on the other hand, eat everywhere-in our cars, at our desks, in the checkout line at the grocery store. In fact, the average calorie consumption in the United States is 3,642 a day, versus 3,551 in France-a small difference that can add up to a five-pound weight gain in six months.  Quelle horreur!       5. Soak up the color . French women fill up on bright-colored vegetables, whether they're in zucchini soup or a beet, lettuce and cabbage salad before their entrÃ©e. Good thing, too, since the antioxidants in these foods help stave off the free radicals produced by cigarette smoke.   6. Make the most of meals . The French space out their courses and eat them at a leisurely pace-generally with friends and family, reports Loomis. In addition to cutting down on indigestion, this practice makes them less likely to overindulge, because the sensation of fullness has time to develop.   7. Wine and dine . Bordeaux and Beaujolais are staples, but French women usually drink them with their meal-no guzzling one or two glasses at the bar before dinner. Plus, glasses in France are only partially filled-the better to taste the wine and cut down on calories.   8. C'est cheese . They love cheese, but treat it as if it were a delicacy-eating it only after meals and stopping after just a slice or two, says Loomis. And although French cheeses seem rich, many (like Brie and chÃ¨vre) are actually lower in calories than American favorites.   9. Park your car . Thirty-five percent of the time, the French get where they're going by walking or biking. Americans don't leave home without their cars a whopping 84 percent of the time.   10. Boycott the buffet . In France, you won't find many all-you-can-eat fests, such as brunch buffets, tailgate parties and unlimited pasta and dessert bars, where it's easy for the calories to add up quickly. The French realize that they will get to eat again in a few hours.",female,43,indUnk,Capricorn,1

197992,3908259,2004-07-27,"On behalf of the great state of Illinois, crossroads of a nation, land of Lincoln, let me express my deepest gratitude for the privilege of addressing this convention. Tonight is a particular honor for me because, let's face it, my presence on this stage is pretty unlikely.   My father was a foreign student, born and raised in a small village in Kenya. He grew up herding goats, went to school in a tin-roof shack. His father, my grandfather, was a cook, a domestic servant to the British.   But my grandfather had larger dreams for his son. Through hard work and perseverance my father got a scholarship to study in a magical place, America, that stood as a beacon of freedom and opportunity to so many who had come before.   While studying here, my father met my mother. She was born in a town on the other side of the world, in Kansas.   Her father worked on oil rigs and farms through most of the Depression. The day after Pearl Harbor my grandfather signed up for duty, joined Patton's army and marched across Europe. Back home, my grandmother raised their baby and went to work on a bomber assembly line. After the war, they studied on the GI Bill, bought a house through FHA, and moved west, all the way to Hawaii, in search of opportunity.   And they, too, had big dreams for their daughter, a common dream, born of two continents.  My parents shared not only an improbable love; they shared an abiding faith in the possibilities of this nation. They would give me an African name, Barack, or ""blessed,"" believing that in a tolerant America your name is no barrier to success.   They imagined me going to the best schools in the land, even though they weren't rich, because in a generous America you don't have to be rich to achieve your potential.   They're both passed away now. And yet, I know that, on this night, they look down on me with pride.   And I stand here today, grateful for the diversity of my heritage, aware that my parents' dreams live on in my two precious daughters.   I stand here knowing that my story is part of the larger American story, that I owe a debt to all of those who came before me, and that, in no other country on Earth, is my story even possible.   Tonight, we gather to affirm the greatness of our nation, not because of the height of our skyscrapers, or the power of our military, or the size of our economy. Our pride is based on a very simple premise, summed up in a declaration made over two hundred years ago, ""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal. That they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights. That among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.""   That is the true genius of America, a faith in the simple dreams, an insistence on small miracles. That we can tuck in our children at night and know they are fed and clothed and safe from harm. That we can say what we think, write what we think, without hearing a sudden knock on the door. That we can have an idea and start our own business without paying a bribe. That we can participate in the political process without fear of retribution, and that our votes will be counted -- or at least, most of the time.   This year, in this election, we are called to reaffirm our values and commitments, to hold them against a hard reality and see how we are measuring up, to the legacy of our forbearers and the promise of future generations.   And fellow Americans -- Democrats, Republicans, Independents -- I say to you tonight: we have more work to do. More work to do for the workers I met in Galesburg, Illinois, who are losing their union jobs at the Maytag plant that's moving to Mexico, and now are having to compete with their own children for jobs that pay seven bucks an hour. More to do for the father I met who was losing his job and choking back tears, wondering how he would pay $4,500 a month for the drugs his son needs without the health benefits that he counted on. More to do for the young woman in East St. Louis, and thousands more like her, who has the grades, has the drive, has the will, but doesn't have the money to go to college.   Now don't get me wrong. The people I meet in small towns and big cities, in diners and office parks, they don't expect government to solve all their problems. They know they have to work hard to get ahead and they want to.   Go into the collar counties around Chicago, and people will tell you they don't want their tax money wasted by a welfare agency or the Pentagon.   Go into any inner city neighborhood, and folks will tell you that government alone can't teach our kids to learn. They know that parents have to parent, that children can't achieve unless we raise their expectations and turn off the television sets and eradicate the slander that says a black youth with a book is acting white. They know those things.   People don't expect government to solve all their problems. But they sense, deep in their bones, that with just a change in priorities, we can make sure that every child in America has a decent shot at life, and that the doors of opportunity remain open to all. They know we can do better. And they want that choice.   In this election, we offer that choice. Our party has chosen a man to lead us who embodies the best this country has to offer. And that man is John Kerry.   John Kerry understands the ideals of community, faith, and service, because they've defined his life. From his heroic service in Vietnam to his years as prosecutor and lieutenant governor, through two decades in the United States Senate, he has devoted himself to this country. Again and again, we've seen him make tough choices when easier ones were available. His values and his record affirm what is best in us.   John Kerry believes in an America where hard work is rewarded. So instead of offering tax breaks to companies shipping jobs overseas, he'll offer them to companies creating jobs here at home.   John Kerry believes in an America where all Americans can afford the same health coverage our politicians in Washington have for themselves.   John Kerry believes in energy independence, so we aren't held hostage to the profits of oil companies or the sabotage of foreign oil fields.   John Kerry believes in the constitutional freedoms that have made our country the envy of the world, and he will never sacrifice our basic liberties nor use faith as a wedge to divide us.  And John Kerry believes that in a dangerous world, war must be an option sometimes, but it should never be the first option.   You know, a while back, I met a young man named Shamus at the VFW Hall in East Moline, Illinois. He was a good-looking kid, 6-2 or 6-3, clear eyed, with an easy smile. He told me he'd joined the Marines and was heading to Iraq the following week.   And as I listened to him explain why he'd enlisted, his absolute faith in our country and its leaders, his devotion to duty and service, I thought this young man was all that any of us might hope for in a child. But then I asked myself: Are we serving Shamus as well as he was serving us?   I thought of the 900 men and women, sons and daughters, husbands and wives, friends and neighbors, who will not be returning to their hometowns. I thought of families I had met who were struggling to get by without a loved one's full income, or whose loved ones had returned with a limb missing or nerves shattered, but who still lacked long-term health benefits because they were reservists.   When we send our young men and women into harm's way, we have a solemn obligation not to fudge the numbers or shade the truth about why they're going, to care for their families while they're gone, to tend to the soldiers upon their return, and to never ever go to war without enough troops to win the war, secure the peace, and earn the respect of the world.   Now let me be clear. Let me be clear. We have real enemies in the world. These enemies must be found. They must be pursued and they must be defeated.   John Kerry knows this. And just as Lieutenant Kerry did not hesitate to risk his life to protect the men who served with him in Vietnam, President Kerry will not hesitate one moment to use our military might to keep America safe and secure.   John Kerry believes in America. And he knows that it's not enough for just some of us to prosper. For alongside our famous individualism, there's another ingredient in the American saga. A belief that we are all connected as one people.   If there's a child on the South Side of Chicago who can't read, that matters to me, even if it's not my child.   If there's a senior citizen somewhere who can't pay for their prescription and has to choose between medicine and the rent, that makes my life poorer, even if it's not my grandparent.  If there's an Arab-American family being rounded up without benefit of an attorney or due process, that threatens my civil liberties.   It is that fundamental belief -- it is that fundamental belief -- I am my brother's keeper, I am my sister's keeper -- that makes this country work.   It's what allows us to pursue our individual dreams, yet still come together as a single American family. ""E pluribus unum."" Out of many, one.   Now even as we speak, there are those who are preparing to divide us, the spin masters and negative ad peddlers who embrace the politics of anything goes.   Well, I say to them tonight, there's not a liberal America and a conservative America -- there is the United States of America.   There's not a black America and white America and Latino America and Asian America -- there is the United States of America.   The pundits, the pundits like to slice and dice our country into red states and blue states; red states for Republicans, blue states for Democrats. But I've got news for them, too. We worship an awesome God in the blue states, and we don't like federal agents poking around our libraries in the red states.   We coach Little League in the blue states and have gay friends in the red states.   There are patriots who opposed the war in Iraq and patriots who supported it.   We are one people, all of us pledging allegiance to the stars and stripes, all of us defending the United States of America.   In the end, that's what this election is about. Do we participate in a politics of cynicism or do we participate in a politics of hope?   John Kerry calls on us to hope. John Edwards calls on us to hope. I'm not talking about blind optimism here-the almost willful ignorance that thinks unemployment will go away if we just don't talk about it, or the health care crisis will solve itself if we just ignore it.   That's not what I'm talking [about]. I'm talking about something more substantial. It's the hope of slaves sitting around a fire singing freedom songs; the hope of immigrants setting out for distant shores; the hope of a young naval lieutenant bravely patrolling the Mekong Delta; the hope of a mill worker's son who dares to defy the odds; the hope of a skinny kid with a funny name who believes that America has a place for him, too.   Hope in the face of difficulty, hope in the face of uncertainty, the audacity of hope.   In the end, that is God's greatest gift to us, the bedrock of this nation; a belief in things not seen; a belief that there are better days ahead.   I believe we can give our middle class relief and provide working families with a road to opportunity.   I believe we can provide jobs to the jobless, homes to the homeless, and reclaim young people in cities across America from violence and despair.   I believe that we have a righteous wind at our backs, and that as we stand on the crossroads of history, we can make the right choices and meet the challenges that face us.   America, tonight, if you feel the same energy that I do, if you feel the same urgency that I do, if you feel the same passion that I do, if you feel the same hopefulness that I do, if we do what we must do, then I have no doubt that all across the country, from Florida to Oregon, from Washington to Maine, the people will rise up in November, and John Kerry will be sworn in as president. And John Edwards will be sworn in as vice president. And this country will reclaim its promise. And out of this long political darkness a brighter day will come.   Thank you very much, everybody. God bless you. Thank you.",female,43,indUnk,Capricorn,1

""Mend my life!"" each voice cried. But you didn't stop. You knew what you had to do, though the wind pried with its stiff fingers at the very foundations, though their melancholy was terrible. It was already late enough, and a wild night, and the road full of fallen branches and stones. But little by little, as you left their voices behind, the stars began to burn through the sheets of clouds, and there was a new voice which you slowly recognized as your own, that kept you company as you strode deeper and deeper into the world, determined to do the only thing you could do-- determined to save the only life you could save.

I just looked at myself in the mirror and I frightened myself. Circles under my eyes. I feel so tired. I just want to sleep. I don't know how much of this is that I'm still not sleeping well or switching back to Celexa. He who shall not be named used to say that I had a small case of narcolepsy on the Celexa, that it made me drowsy. I don't really recall that but I do know that I already feel calmer inside.

There's the part of me saying ""yippee"" because I can feel it and it's taken 3 years for that to happen. I just loved going to classes where the instructor said ""feel it?"" and I said ""no"" because the whole area was numb. The nerves were cut and feeling anything in that spot is difficult at best. Yet, after much serious abdominal work, I CAN feel that area now, or at least the underlying muscles are finally letting me know they are still there. Or maybe the nerve-endings are growing back. In any case, I can feel that area and everything else too. All 14 some abdominal ""muscles"" (because they are really just one big muscle) are screaming a collective ""ow!"". So what am I going to do tonight? Go to Pilates. And then take my second to last training session with Dre, at least for a while or until some rich unknown relative adopts me. I am truly out of my mind.  The only reason I can give for this insanity is that it is the only thing that stands between me and some day looking like a shorter version of my mother, a fate worse than death IMNSHO.

Food is good times. I am no longer going to feel guilty about it. I LIKE FOOD. No! I LOVE FOOD! But I don't want it to love me to death. I have the cholesterol thing that makes me a walking stroke possibility. I can't ignore the issue or that I have other genetic health issues lurking in the shadows. So while I have to admit (although it isn't always apparent), I really don't like going to the gym and I don't really like exercising, I can get excited about it once I get there (it's the getting there that's hard) and I need the gym and I need the exercise to stave off the mommy genes that I have hardwired into my system. And, I really do like the results. Because I've finally come to the conclusion that I will no longer be a skinny minny without starving myself and I'm not going to do that. So I must exercise and weight train. So if I can't be little, I can be fit.

Then, I went to Hagerstown (MD) City Park Duck Island for the birthday party of my friend Cheryl's 2- year old grandson, Ashton.

She could go into business. We all got thank you cards for coming to the party with new pictures of Ashton, who's getting really big! There were also Hershey bars that were in special wrappers (of course with ducks) and the cake was also in the shape of a duck. All the kids got cupcakes that had little rubber duckies as the toppers. Never a dull moment, Ashton fell in the pond  when they went to feed the ducks and his dad had to go home and get him a change of clothes. I was figuring it'd be cake and ice cream.

I'd never been there. Across the street, are some very old mansion houses. It looks like it might have been the wealthy area of Hagerstown back in the day but those days are obviously gone.

198009,3908259,2004-08-04,"urlLink http://www.yogasite.com/panicattack.htm   A wonderful article on yoga and panic anxiety disorder. Get a Grip on Panic Attacks by Rolf Sovik  Jeff was sure he was having a heart attack. His heart was pounding faster than it ever had before. His chest ached and the pain radiated toward his left arm. He felt shaky. As he tried to focus on what was happening to him, the world grew distant and unreal. Anxiety welled up. Jeff managed to call his physician, who arranged for quick transport to the emergency room. There, however, a battery of tests failed to reveal the cause of his symptoms. A second attack occurred a few days later, and still no physiological cause could be found. Before long, panic attacks had become part of Jeffâs life.  Recognizing Panic Disorder Everyone sometimes feels anxious for no identifiable reason. At these times we think, âSomething is happeningâI must stay alert.â Panic victims share these feelings, but for them the stakes are higher. Their distress is so overwhelming that the fearful possibilities take on mammoth proportions. âIâm having a heart attack,â they think, or âIâm losing my mind.â We all experience periods of vague anxiety, which often pass without our ever discovering or having to acknowledge the causes. Panic anxiety, however, is the cue for a determined (and often desperate) search for a source.  Panic attacks are characterized by rapidly escalating and overwhelming anxiety. In the beginning, panickers are rarely able to identify what has made them anxious, describing the episodes as occurring âout of the blue.â The attacks are triggered by frightening physical sensations that occur suddenly, much like an unconscious reflex. Among the most common are shortness of breath, a rapid heart rate, heart palpitations, sweating, trembling, a feeling of choking, chest pain, nausea, and dizziness. Frightened sufferers develop painfully sharp sensitivity to these sensations, often making several trips to the emergency room before they finally realize that their symptoms are panic-related.  Physical sensations alone are not the core of the illness. Fearful thoughts, unpleasant emotions, avoidant behaviors, disturbing sensations, and deteriorating relationships all collude with one another to maintain panic. Thoughts such as the fear of dying or of having a mental breakdown are common. Even mild anxiety can trigger an attack, and any disturbing emotion can be interpreted as a precursor to full-fledged panic.  Gradually, the fear of having an attack in public leads the panicker to avoid those placesâa disorder known as agoraphobia. Problems in relationships, which may have been the original source of anxiety, become worse as panic episodes develop. Difficulty with self-assertiveness and with the resolution of conflicts increases. Friends and partners are often frustrated because they cannot understand what is happening.   The Road to Recovery Fortunately, panic disorder can be treated successfully, frequently with a combination of psychotherapy and medication. Panic sufferers are now turning to yoga for help as well, for yoga offers a wide range of stress-reducing tools. An ancient model of recovery can be found in the Yoga Sutra of Patanjali, one which is also embodied in the Four Noble Truths of the Buddha. In its briefest form, this model is an outline of the stages in the healing process, presented here as four questions:  1. What is the nature of the pain that all humans experience? 2. What is the cause of that pain? 3. What will be experienced when the pain is removed? 4. How can the pain be removed?  Yoga tells us that before searching for a cure it is important to look deeply into the nature and causes of illness. It is also important to get an idea of how things will be when symptoms have been removed, because otherwise we may have illusions about what recovery will be like. For example, eliminating anxiety is not the outcome of treatment for panicâthe outcome is the ability to manage anxious feelings. If we rewrite the four questions of the ancient model, focusing on panic attacks, they might read:  1. What is panic disorder? 2. What causes it? 3. What will life be like for the person who has overcome panic attacks? 4. How is recovery accomplished?   Looking for a Cause Biologically oriented physicians have tended to attribute panic symptoms to problems of the nervous system. Jacob DaCosta, a Civil War physician, set the tone when he wrote, âIt seems to me most likely that the heart has become irritable from its overreaction and frequent excitement, and that disordered innervation keeps it so.â This focus on biochemistry and physiology led to the development of tranquilizers.  Not long afterwards, Freud identified a form of anxiety that appeared in discrete, time-limited episodes. âAn anxiety attack of this sort,â he wrote, âmay have linked to it a disturbance of one or more of the bodily functionsâsuch as respiration, heart action, vasomotor innervation, or glandular activity.â Nearly one hundred years later, this focus on the emotional component of panic has resulted in the psychiatric diagnosis called Panic Disorder.  More recently, clinicians have been exploring the role of disturbed breathing in panic attacks. As early as 1950, the physician R. L. Rice maintained that anxiety attacks were often the result, not the cause, of disturbed breathing; now psychotherapies for panic that include breath training are state-of-the-art. (Even so, very little training in this area is available to clinicians.)  Those who are familiar with yoga will recognize the classic body-breath-mind triad in these three points of view. But if a single cause for panic disorder exists, it has yet to be discovered. Instead, these three areas seem to interact with one another, forming feedback loops that grow larger if not addressed in some way.  For example, if someone is afraid of going to public places, then self-esteem plummets, fears increase, opportunities for relationships are limited, and panic-prone factors such as the fear of being labeled âincompetentâ grow. Conversely, if the fear has been overcome, then self-esteem improves, fearful thinking is reduced, opportunities for relationships expand, and panic-prone factors are undermined.   The First Steps to Recovery We have already seen what panic disorder is and we have a general idea of what causes it. Our next step is to discover how yoga, coupled with clinical experience, can help panickers take the steps necessary to recover. The first priority is to manage the frightening physical sensations accompanying panic attacks, because they will make any other work impossible. Panickers walk on pins and needles attempting to avoid the sudden, uncontrollable symptoms of their disorder, and because these involve rapid arousal of the nervous system, it is imperative to find ways to strengthen the nerves and calm anxiety.  Arousal is subtle and is triggered in a number of ways, but the key to calming it is to learn how to âtalkâ to the nerves, how to communicate across the great divide between voluntary and involuntary functioning. Once the panicker has learned to manage involuntary reactions, the sense of being out of control is enormously reduced.  Yoga training can be particularly useful here, for yoga teaches us how to interact with the nervous system. If we want to soothe and strengthen it, we need to learn deep, relaxed yogic breathing. Regardless of the pathways of arousal, breathing is the language of nervous system balance and control.  To illustrate this relationship, imagine how you would react if you were walking along a dark street, and a pointed object were thrust suddenly into your back. You might gasp, then tense your whole body. Gasping is the natural reaction to sudden fear. If you discovered that the attacker was only a friend playing a joke, you might sigh with relief. Then your breath might become agitated as your fear turned to irritation. The way you breathe reflects how you feel.  This relationship between breath and nerves is a two-way street. Just as emotions create changes in breathing, so changing our style of breathing can alter the way we feel. Breathing is the only involuntary function that can be easily and voluntarily controlled. During times of panic, relaxed, controlled breathing will give us immediate access to the nervous system. This means that by changing our breathing, we can change the condition of our nerves when tension disturbs and frightens us. Then, when breathing is relaxed and the panic response has been calmed, the underlying anxiety can be gradually brought to conscious awareness for processing.   Learning Relaxed Breathing Practicing yoga is a good way to learn breathing skills, for it is a gradual process, often needing considerable support over a period of time. Yoga teachers quickly recognize when a student is having trouble (as is often the case with panickers), and they know a wide variety of alternate practices that will help the student master breathing skills.  The ultimate goal of breath training is to make smooth, diaphragmatic breathing a twenty-four hour habit. The corpse pose (lying on the back) and the crocodile pose (lying on the stomach with arms folded under the forehead) are both helpful training postures. Breathing with a ten-pound sandbag on the upper abdomen while lying in the corpse pose will help to strengthen the diaphragm and serve as a reminder to focus on the abdomen as well. In addition, it is helpful if the panicker learns to pay attention to breathing as often as possible during the day. Notice when the breath stops, notice when it jerks, for once an irregularity is obvious, it can be corrected. This practice not only fosters awareness, it makes the relationship between stress and breathing abundantly clear.  Panickers will find that diaphragmatic breathing not only calms the effect of arousal at the time of panic, it also provides an alternative focus for attention, allowing them to focus on their breathing instead of on the panic symptoms. As diaphragmatic breathing becomes a habit, the nervous system is less susceptible to panic in the first place. It usually takes about two weeks to become accustomed to the feeling of diaphragmatic breathing, and about six months of regular practice to make it a habit.   Special Problems in Breath Training There are a few potential problems that panickers may experience during breath training, and it is well for both student and teacher to understand them at the outset. The most common is that panickers have often developed a highly self-vigilant style that can lead to performance anxiety. (âIs it supposed to feel this way?â) Micro-managing has become a way of life to panickers. The teacher needs to be warmâreassuring but firm, letting the practice do the teaching, without becoming over-analytical. Breathing does not need to be perfect to be good enough.  Sometimes panickers carry a great deal of physical tension in their bodies, and in these cases the natural unblocking effect of yoga stretches and postures can be helpful. Releasing abdominal tension while resting between postures promotes deep breathing. Covering the body with a blanket during relaxation and breath training can ease the feeling of being exposed or vulnerable.  A knot may sometimes form in the abdomen during panic attacks, making breathing difficult. As the attack continues hunger for air increases, but despite the need for air the panicker may feel that holding the breath is the way to âcatchâ it. Relaxed, continuous breathing, on the other hand, releases the unconscious tension created by holding the breath, and with practice it is possible to actually breathe through the knot that forms in the stomach during periods of anxiety. As increased awareness makes it possible to recognize tension early, it becomes easier to remain relaxed. To establish a smooth, unbroken flow of breath, the teacher might say, âWhen you come to the end of the inhalation and your abdomen has fully expanded, simply relax and let the exhalation begin. When you come to the end of the exhalation and your abdomen has contracted, simply relax and let the inhalation begin. Let each breath flow into the next breath by relaxing.â  Beyond Diaphragmatic Breathing Many therapists have begun to use breath training in their work with clients, but few have been trained to teach more than the basics of diaphragmatic breathing. Yoga, on the other hand, offers many additional breathing and relaxation skills that can help recovering panickers. Perhaps the most effective of these is nadi shodhanam (channel purification). As its name suggests, nadi shodhanam works to unblock tensions and resistance in the energy-conveying channels of the physical and subtle bodies, thus calming and strengthening sensitive nerves.  Normal breathing carries away wastes and brings in fresh energy with each breath. As energy is brought in, it must be assimilated and distributed efficiently in order to fulfill the purpose of breathing. Thatâs where nadi shodhanam comes in. The process of channel purification slows breathing down and focuses our attention on its flow. At the same time, according to yoga masters, this practice cleanses the subtle vessels through which physical and mental energy is passing. As these vessels become cleaner, energy moves with less effort, and its distribution and assimilation within the mind and body are improved. The result is reduced tension in the nervous system as well as a calmer mind.  Nadi shodhanam is not the only yoga tool for deepening relaxation. Techniques combining postures, breathing, and systematic relaxation kindle a sense of confidence in us no matter how much daily life seems to bend us out of shape. Exercises that relax both muscles and joints, as well as the 61-points relaxation exercise, lead further toward relaxed self-awareness. These techniques can be taught once students are familiar with the beginning practices. (For a detailed description of nadi shodhanam, see the Yoga International reprint âBalancing Active and Receptive Energies: The Practice of Nadi Shodhanam.â  Expanding the Recovery Process Along with breath training, panickers need to begin the process of resolving their fears. Sometimes they do this work on their own or with the help of friends and family members. Often, however, a period of psychotherapy is needed because the worries and stresses that initially contributed to the onset of panic require objective attention. Before treatment these factors are outside of the panickerâs awareness for some reason. As recovery continues, however, they become the proverbial elephant in the living roomâthere is no way to avoid noticing and dealing with them.  Often the stresses that are most difficult to recognize have to do with significant relationships. A question that can elicit awareness is, âAm I avoiding conflicts within myself?â As one panicker continued in recovery, for example, he was able to explain that his younger brother, who was in line to become a co-partner in the family business, was performing very poorly. Despite many signs to the contrary, the younger brother continued to imagine that he was doing well at his work. Addressing this problem raised many fears, for it would affect a complex web of family relationships. As a result, the older brother resisted speaking up and began having panic attacks instead.  There are many possible causes of panic attacksâstressful relationships, past traumas, fear of separation from loved ones are among the most common. One panickerâs attacks began when her husbandâs promotion resulted in his being away from her and their infant twins at night. Pleased about the promotion, the husband had not been willing to see the effect it was having on his family, and the wife had not been able to express her fears directly. In the course of psychotherapy, this woman learned that finding practical ways to expand the scope of awareness and implement stress-reducing changes (ask for them, create them, or compromise for them in some way), although difficult, was the most satisfying process in the entire recovery.  There will inevitably be leaps forward as well as setbacks while recovery continues. This is natural, for the recovering panicker is learning to work with him- or herself in an entirely new way. Whether or not the panicker is undergoing psychotherapy, the psychological insights acquired through yoga can make a profound contribution to this process. A young student once remarked, âYoga stands for You Oughta Get Aware,â because it provides such a wide range of tools to help everyone, including recovering panickers, do just that.  The Role of Meditation In addition to the body and breath, yoga works with emotions, mental images, thoughts, and relationships, seeing them all as part of an integrated whole. During meditation, for example, a normally disturbing image arising in the mind is greeted by a very different reaction than might otherwise be the case. Now the body remains rested and still; the breath sends messages of steadiness and balance to the emotions and nervous system. Though the image might seem upsetting at another time, now the meditator can witness it with equanimity. This neutral reaction allows time and space for the image either to be processed or to pass through the mind without disturbance.  What is more, meditation seems to pace itself; it allows the mind to gradually gather strength before bringing up the images that might prove most frightening or challenging. Trivia can be dismissed, but the thoughts and images that persist are the ones that have important consequences to us. For instance, suppose I begin to recognize a deep-seated unhappiness with my work, but at the same time I see no other way to support my family. This conflict haunts me, affecting my work and frustrating my family relationships. Panickers may force themselves to push such conflicts out of awareness because they cause a discord that seems unresolvable. Meditation will allow them to recognize it with less fear so that they can see their way through the problem.  Conflict Resolution Yoga psychology also suggests many techniques for resolving conflicts, including acknowledging and accepting the conflict in all its depth; recognizing the need for some kind of change; resisting the inclination to act out feelings or to do nothing; exploring alternatives; communicating with others without blaming them; accepting feedback from others; using discrimination in accepting or rejecting alternatives; surrendering to necessary losses; acting with determination; accepting outcomes with equanimity; working calmly on a problem even if a negative outcome, or no outcome, seems inevitable; and letting intuition suggest new possibilities. These strategies are derived from what in yoga are called the yamas and niyamasâthe attitudes toward life that are the basis of all yoga practices.   Finding Refuge in Our True Nature Ultimately, yoga provides a philosophy that places the relationships between body, mind, and spirit in a new perspective. The Bhagavad Gita, a classic yoga text, tells us that âNo one has the power to bring to destruction this unalterable entity [our true inner self]. . . . The body-bearer in everyoneâs body is eternally undestroyable.â Anxiety arises from attachment to passing and impermanent things, but the more we are aware of our own true nature, the less anxious we become.  Yoga gives us a practical tool for working at this level of awarenessâthe mantra. This is a word or phrase that can guide and protect us. It serves as a focus of attention in times of panic, and it is a resting place for awareness leading to our true nature. Through its connection to the deep spiritual resources that lie within us, the mantra pacifies fear and encourages us to persist in the face of disturbing thoughts and upsetting emotions.  We cannot prevent life from changing. Life is inherently unstable. But during periods of change we can have the courage to identify and express our needs. We can look for ways to surrender gracefully to the inevitable. We can trust, through our experience of yoga, that the essential Self within us will guide us through the emotions of change successfully.

198010,3908259,2004-08-03,"I think that it's been important to take stock of my life and make peace with myself. I'm not very good at it. I'm an inpatient pupil at best and a stubborn mule at worst. Learning to live with myself as I am, not as I wish I were, is difficult. Yeah, of course, there are those things I can change, but one thing I have learned in this divorce, is that you can have change of habit forced on you, but given an inch, you revert to your true nature. You have to want the change and sometimes, I just don't know how much I really want it.       Like my weight and the way I look, which ReGina has so forcefully told me that I will keel over if I don't stop obsessing. I understand the obsession. My mother is, and my grandmothers were, heavy-set. I was a skinny person constantly being told to watch what I ate so I didn't look like them when I got older. Then of course, I married Steve, whose mother is anorexic and for whom food is a constant obsession and how you look is too. The woman is over 75 and weighs herself twice a day. Steve was always on me about my weight. The day he told me the 5-10 pounds I had gained made me unattractive to him, was the day I started my obsession in earnest. Six years of him calling me chubsie ubsie on top of my upbringing is a hard habit to break.  And I claim I want to have that lean strong body. But do I?  I want to break this habit of obsessing for sure. It's not healthy, and it is making me manic. I don't want to get depressed looking in a mirror. I don't want to be interested in a man and worry that he won't find me attractive as I am now, not as he'd like me to be. I will always be 5'3"" tall. I will always be curvy. I will always be somewhat prone to pudge. And I am tired of fighting it all the time. I am tired of thinking ""more, more and more"" or ""never good enough"".  I have some ideas about it but I don't know how they will wash at the gym. I think the tendonitis in my arm was a call to arms (so to speak) that I was overdoing it FOR ME. I may be strong enough to lift all that weight but my 43 year old body is screaming ""STOP IT!"" So I will continue weight bearing exercise but not at that level. Some is good for your health all the experts agree. But I don't want to be in pain, have swelling behind my knee, have pain in my wrists from lifting heavy weights, be unable to lift my arm past my waist and be Charlie-horsed all the damned time any more. So do I really want the long lean thin look? I don't know if in my heart I really want it or think I have to have it to be loved. That's a dark corner I'm not sure I'm ready to look in.  I am increasing my yoga and meditation practice. I have been lax about it and I miss it but have done nothing to change it, focusing on the gym. It is too important to my physical, emotional and spiritual health to let it go any longer. I am not going to get crazy about ""doing the pose"" as it's not important to always do it deeply. It's important to have the form and the breath and to just be. In the moment. That's what it's about anyhow.  I am not going to stress if I am a little pudgy. This will be tough. I have critics all around me, namely myself and my mother. But I am not giving up the foods I love. I can eat them less. I can eat smaller portions. But I am not giving them up until the doctor tells me that it's life or death. Because giving them up without that ultimatum, I might as well shrivel up and die.  I am not giving up on a great love. I may never find it and I'm not going to panic about it. But I realize that 6 years has numbed me and jaded me and I can't be that person. I didn't like that person.  I have already given up on drinking cup upon cup of caffeinated coffee. As Phyll said to me today, I am my grandmother's granddaughter. But all that caffeine is just no good for this anxiety-prone woman. So, 1-2 cups in the morning, which I look forward to and then decaf or, as I've found I've gone back to my true nature, tea in the afternoon and evening. Without Singer, it just evolved.  I have got to stop the inner voice telling me to clean up my messes. That voice is Singer. I am not a dirty person. I hate dirty bathroom and kitchens, but clutter never much bothered me. Singer never let me have clutter. And I've been finding myself giving myself the business if my closet was messy or if I had the newspaper in the floor by the loveseat or if I have 6 pairs of shoes all over the house, and feeling guilty about it. What utter nonsense! What I have noticed, is how I've gone back to pre-Singer in that I am allowing the clutter.  I had dinner with Cheryl last Friday and she noticed my blouse and said something to the effect that it was very bright and cheerful and she wasn't used to seeing me in such bright colors and how much it lighted up my face. Pre-Singer, I was prone to rather bright clothing yet he basically culled my wardrobe. I bought the shirt before the divorce but wore it rarely because he hated it. Post-Singer, I am buying more fun clothing again.  Like I said, a habit forced on you will not remain. It's good to be me again.",female,43,indUnk,Capricorn,1

Things I Hate About You is the show that lets couples document, for all the world to see, one another's most irksome habits and irritating behaviors. Armed with personal video cameras in and outside their home, each partner will capture their opposite doing the little things he or she does that drive them crazy. The video evidence will be presented to a panel of judges who will determine, once and for all, which has the more annoying habits. The more exasperating person will be required to grant one wish to their partner, who will also walk off with a specially-selected prize. Things I Hate About You is hosted by Mo Rocca (The Today Show, The Daily Show with Jon Stewart) and features expert opinions from relationship advisor and author Jacqui Malouf.     So, I'm watching this show and I can certainly say that this couple are more than irritating! I would drown both of them. If I were the other one, I'd want to wait until my partner were asleep and then put him out of his misery. And how they don't do this to each other, I can not fathom.

234847,3519711,2004-06-10,"sewing is a strange thing.. ask anyone who is talented in the craft. it takes a while to muster up the motivation, and when are motivated, you have to make the most of it and sew as much as you possibly can during that small amount of time you have, before you lose it and can't be fucked doing anymore. and it doens't take much to lose motivation - all you have to do is not have enough material, or make a mistake which would be complicated and time consuming to fix, and your work gets thrown back into the pile until the next time you can be bothered pulling out, dusting off and setting up the sewing machine. i truly believe that when i move out (ha! ""when"", that cracks me up everytime), if i could get a house with a spare room that i could convert into a sewing room, i may be more motivated to get stuff done cause the machine would be permanently set up, ready to go. but back to the trouble at hand.... i have two costumes to make by mid august. one is relatively simple, the other ridiculously complicated. i am about 75% of the way through the relatively simple costume.. i just need to sew on the trimmings and such. now i would've finished this last night, had i bought enough ribbon, but alas i did not. of course at the time i was still motivated, so i told myself that i would go to and buy some more ribbon today and finish it all off. instead, i slept in, and have been online since 1pm, lurking on various forums, checking emails (checking emails and kicking cheats until the day i die), reading random crap, and watching the first few episodes of wolf's rain, which is quite good (excellent soundtrack by yoko kanno, tho if you know her stuff, then you know that i expect nothing less but the best from her). i am working tomorrow, so the ribbon will be right under my nose. i will buy it. and seeing loki is working that somewhat stops me from being online, so i may just get this done by the end of tomorrow night... maybe.",female,23,indUnk,Aquarius,1

Ma ends up getting some important position in the military, but not before wooing Madame Wang, Wang's wife.  the highlight of this great film? the death rolls. everytime someone died, they would have to either die of over acting, or roll down a hill. and the camera would always cut away from the action to follow them down the hill. fun for the whole family.   raja  well this was an interesting change for a film. after so many quiet, meditative films, i find one that is very much dialogue driven. i don't think there was more than 30 seconds of silence between dialogue throughout the whole film, except when they were kissing. a nice film about a french man in his 40s living in morocco, who is attracted to 19 year old raja, who works for him. she is also attracted to him, but plays hard to get most of the film. i missed the last ten minutes cause i had to meet loki before the start of the next film, but i'm sure it will be shown on sbs about fifty times, its that kinda film.    the eye  well this was interesting. i had heard about this film for some time, and was expecting it to be a lot scarier than it was. it was certainly a tense film, and had some images that i'm sure will stay in my head to freak me out for some time, but it could've been a lot scarier.  the movie is about a woman who has been blind all her life, and undergoes a cornea transplant, and is able to see. but she is also able to see ghosts, and these dudes who are kinda like the grim reaper, taking the spirits away. some of these spirits were really freaky, like the lady in the caligraphy class who demands that she get out of her seat. not a great film overall, but still worth a watch, especially if you like that kinda horror film (ie: ring, the grudge, etc.)   there is no review of day 4 cause i didn't go to the film festival last night.. instead i spent 4 1/2 hours gaming away at galactic circus.. which was lotsa fun. played parapara for the first time, and i think its my new fave game, cause you dance to initial d songs, and seeing i know them all i sing along too! Loki and i played some craji firefighting game, which was shockingly bad.. Loki's hose didn't even work, so i had to save the house all by myself! also hogged the premiere2 machine (which is like a korean  DDR, but with the feet in different positions), which was what i first learnt on (cause all the DDR machines were always taken :P).

234858,3519711,2004-07-24,"i know its only the second day, but so far i seem to see one standout film and two mediocre films.. lets hope that changes tonight. the problem with last night was that i enjoyed the first film so much that nothing seemed to reach the same level of enjoyment after that.    bright future  this film was just great. i enjoyed every minute of it. the story is about 24 yr old nimura, who lacks social skills, and freaks out at situations he can't handle. he befriends 27yr old mamoru, who helps him out, by telling him when to wait, and when to go ahead (in life). mamoru also owns a cool pet jellyfish, which he is trying to climatise to freshwater. mamoru ends up killing their boss, and gives the jellyfish to nimura. now in jail and facing the death penalty, mamoru mentors nimura from behind bars, as nimura is lost without him. much to his distress, nimura loses the jellyfish in the river. mamrou ends up killing himself, leaving nimura a message to go ahead. nimura then befriends mamoru's father, and they go on a quest for the lost jellyfish.  i so want a pet jellyfish after this movie.. it was just so wonderful in every way. i have yet to see the director's other films, tho a friend is going to lend them to me, so i can't wait to see them!   road to koktebel  slow, russian film about a father and son who travel on foot from moscow to crimea to his sisters house to start anew. there was nothing terribly wrong with this film, but there was nothing that blew me away either. a lot of the jolty camerawork did annoy me tho, as i found it impossible to focus on anything sometimes. there was some beautiful imagery tho, especially at the end in crimea. gives the impression that russia outside of moscow is a very underdeveloped country, which i'm not suprised about.    azumi  once again, another movie i had high hopes for and failed to deliver. the review in the festival guide claimed it has ""some of the most impressive swordplay in the history of samurai epics"". the swordplay was shit. i could do a better job and i've never held a sword in my life. azumi was far too cutesy a character to be a cool, arse kicking chick.. and the special effects were something out of the 80's. i'm pretty sure it was CG, but it looked like chromakey. it was silly, i'll give it that, and it didn't take itself seriously, which is good, but from what i had heard, i thought it was gonna be a lot better. if you want a cool arse kicking japanese chick film, see the princess blade instead.. the girl is way cooler.",female,23,indUnk,Aquarius,1

234863,3519711,2004-07-02,"ok, so i'm in limbo with my hours and pay and such.. they will ""review"" it all at the beginning of august. i had planned to leave in october. at the moment i don't think i'm going anywhere soon. this depresses me. what depresses me even more is that i will be stuck in a job i dont want to be in, but have very little choice cause i need all the money i can get, and i am not willing to sell my body (it seems i have already sold my soul to this company, and possibly my first born, i didn't read the fine print of the work agreement properly).  the new managers started this week, and already they have sucked the life out of the place. the one reason i liked working there was that it wasn't like every other store who did everything by the book, which ended up making life hard for both the customer and the staff, resulting in the staff being abused by an understandably pissed off customer. today i was abused or just generally treated like shit by at least 5 customers.. thats enough to wreck my day. my productivity was questioned because i was too busy serving customers to clean up and put out stock.  shit, i'm sorry i'm making money for you, i'll ignore ppl next time and make sure the place is spotless and stocked up before i even think of looking at a customer, let alone serve them.  i have gone back to not wanting to go to work, which is something i haven't felt for about three months..thanks alot ppl for making my workplace dull, lifeless and stressful.   have shitloads of stuff to do interms of sewing my costumes, but have been too tired lately to do anything. can't make anymore excuses.. i'll have to get my arse into gear tomorrow night, and may have to work on my costumes every night until i get them done.. between this and work i'm a nervous wreck. need to get to japan.. need a holiday!!!!",female,23,indUnk,Aquarius,1
234864,3519711,2004-08-12,"IT'S OVER!!!  i was meant to write this up a couple of days ago but i've been preoccupied with my costume for manifest this weekend. because of that, my thoughts are no longer fresh in my head, so i'll most likely forget something i wanted to mention.   short films   with a number of the films i saw, a short film accompanied the feature. i haven't mentioned the films previously, but i thought i would now   the giant (screened with goodbye, dragon inn)  a russian short film about a guy who walks on stilts, who comes to a small town. the film follows his day as the town 'sundial'. there are 12 rocks on the ground to represent the hours, while he stands there on his stilts, with a pointy bird cage on his head. his shadow looks just like a clock hand. a young girl befriends him, helps him out throughout the day, and learns about his past at night through a series of photos that he shows her. (there is no dialogue in the film). in the middle of the night, little shits take his stilts, and he leaves the town, leaving the young girl devastated. a nice short film, nice imagery, and a good story. much enjoyed.   aspiration (screened with bright future)  this was crap. it made no sense. and i discussed it with someone who also saw it and they agreed that it was crap. a guy, for some reason, is attacking his car (which is on the beach) with a hammer, hammering down all the handles and locks. he then gets in the car and the car is washed away. thats the basics of it, tho you have to sit there for five minutes and stare at a guy who is staring into space, while you hear the sea become louder and louder. thats it. boring as all fuck.   talking with angels (screened with hotel)  of if only they had made this into an 82 minute film, and hotel into a 12 minute short film. this is the sad tale of a mother, who clearly has some mental illness of some sort, and her oldest son, who is torn between his embarrassment of her, and his need to protect her from the harsh world that makes fun of her. the mother leaves the house wearing nothing but a lace curtain, and he demands that she put at least a coat on. later in the street, he sees boys his age, and he lags behind his mum, so that they don't connect her to him. then at the doctors, the receptionist makes scathing comments to a patient about her, and he defends her, and later trashes the waiting room in retaliation. if this had enough funding, it could've been a terribly sad, but potentially good feature film. hopefully the director gets funding to do so soon.   guy maddin's sissy boy slap   party (screened with cowards bend the knee)  sissy boy slap party was actually the first of three short films that were all shown together, but it was the one that stuck in my head the most. for some reason, a bunch of topless gay men lie around doing nothing. when the old man leaves, warning ""and no slapping"" a huge slapfest begin, complete with squealing. the slap fest turns rather sexual until they are all lying in a heap, exhausted. for some reason one man's pants are half down, and when the old man comes back her parks his bike in the guys arse. they get scolded and thats the end. strange. the other two i can't even remember, so i can't comment.   best films  my highlights of the festival would definitely have to be (in no particular order):  samaritan girl   bright future   nobody knows   nine souls   get up!   spring, summer, fall, winter... and spring      fuse would have to be my favourite suprise filler film. blood brothers would have to be my favourite dodgy action film. switchblade romance was my fave of the more mainstream films.     worst films  luckily there weren't many on this list, but the worst would have to be:  hotel   goodbye, dragon inn   golden swallow      the rest of the films were all still good, just not stand out. if you were me was on the lower end, with some of the films being good, and others being crappy.     f00dz  i'd have to thank bubble cup, the bun shop in chinatown that i go to, china bar, and hungry jack's for feeding me over the past few weeks. i won't thank flora tho for over priced curry that wasn't very good.  and thats it for another year. i know i'll definitely go again next year, cause even though i get burnt out, i love it. ^_^ its my escapism for the year.   costume update: two more days till manifest. i still have a lot to do, but i'm sure i'll get it done. i'll just have to work my arse off.",female,23,indUnk,Aquarius,1
234865,3519711,2004-08-08,"didn't go to the film festival on days 14 & 15, as it was loki's  urlLink birthday  on thursday, so i spent that time chillin' with him.   day 16      cowards bend the knee  interesting silent film about a guy who seems to fall in and out of love rather easily. it started off strange, ended up getting even stranger, but wasn't that bad a movie. director guy maddin seems to like to use old film making methods, which is almost a novelty to watch these days. an interesting one to watch.  had more movies planned for this day, but never saw them cause i was too buggered.   day 17      darkness bride  i was expecting this to be a lot darker and eerie than it was. some random virgin who opted to kill herself instead of losing her chastity to a bunch of rapists haunts a small chinese town. another woman, qing hua, has some strange relationship with two men whom she has grown up with all her life. she marries sissy (yes thats his name, and its appropriate), but it seems she like cheung (i think that was his name) better. sissy ends up following his sheep to the city, where he meets the virgin ghost, who has taken the physical form of a prostitute, yan yan. qing and cheung chase after him, and qing is jealous of sissy's relationship with the virgin (btw, its not really clear that she is the ghost at this point, qing just starts rambling on about it, as tho we're meant to know this), and soon both qing and yan yan are competing for both the men's attention. it all ends strangely when yan yan uses the guys for their money, and their paths all seem to split up. i'm not really sure what to make of this film. it was alright, but then it just got weird towards the end.. and the ending was just stupid. not really worth seeing in my opinion.   zatoichi  this would have had to have been one of my most wanted to see of this festival. and it didn't let me down. takeshi kitano's remake of akira kurosawa's  urlLink yojimbo , this was a very enjoyable film. even the strange dancing at the end was good in my opnion. in fact, i really liked how the music was coreographed with the movements of the ppl in the village throughout the whole film. the only problem i had with the film was that it chose to do all the violence in cg. the swords and blood were clearly added, and even tho it was very violent in parts, it didn't affect me cause i didn't find it realistic enough. despite that, it was an excellent film, and seeing that its going to be released here soon, i demand that everyone must see it.   end of the century: the story of the ramones  the ramones have kinda been a part of my musical life all along in the background, tho they've only come to the forefront twice: once when my friend in high school became a punk and subjected us to the ramones at every party, and more recently when my brother really got into them. the documentary really made me dislike most of them. they're all pricks except for joey, johnny is especially an arsehole. he didn't even go to joey's funeral. in fact, i'm amazed they lasted 25 years with all the constant conflict they had. a very interesting documentary that had great live footage. i had to stop myself from singing along with the songs, tho i heard some ppl in the audience do so.   human touch  this film started 30 mins late, so i never saw the end unfortunately.  the token australian film for the festival, human touch was quite a good film from what i saw of it. i believe that it is getting general release here soon, so i think i will have to check it out to see what happens in the end.   breaking news  hong kong action film that was very cool. a shootout is caught on tape and gives the police a bad reputation. the police use the next hostage situation as a chance to manipulate the media in order to make themselves look good again. the main actress had the most annoying large eyebrows since vin diesel's sister in fast and the furious. besides that, a good movie.   spring, summer, fall, winter... and spring  absolutely beautiful story about the life of a korean buddhist monk, the various stages of his life broken up into seasons. written and directed by kim ki duk (samaritan girl), this film may possibly be the best of the festival. nothing was wrong with it. nothing. i just sat there and enjoyed every minute of it.   running on karma  two johnny to films in one day! directed by the same guy who did breaking news, this film was about a monk who could see people's karma just before or after they died. he leaves the monastery to (for some reason) become a beef cake stripper, and ends up determined to save the life of a police woman who has bad karma because of a japanese soldier in ww2. the ending wasn't obvious either, which was good, cause they could have so easily gone that way. andy lau should be banned from muscle suits. he's a rather attractive man, but not ""bulked up"". not as good as breaking news, but still an enjoyable film.  and that was the festival! i didn't go to day 18 cause i didn't book the tickets in time, and all the good movies sold out. silly me. in a couple of days i will post a summary where i will list my highlights, and also review all the short films i saw over the course of the past two weeks. but at the moment i'm up to my eyeballs in sewing with my costumes, and i'm stressing that i'm not gonna get it all done.",female,23,indUnk,Aquarius,1
234866,3519711,2004-08-04,"i had planned to see about five films yesterday, but between costuming, and getting my haircut, i only managed to see one film. but oh what a film it was!   adventures of iron pussy  now c'mon, how can something with a title like that not be good? actually, it was good in that ""so bad its good"" way. it is the adventures of a thai transvestite crime fighter, that all of a sudden becomes a musical  a third of the way into the film. bad costumes, bad jokes, terrible subtitling (this would have to be the year of bad subtitiling.. did all the good subtitlers get better jobs or something?), it was just hilarious. a must see, especially for a drunken night with friends who have the same bad sense of humour as you do :P",female,23,indUnk,Aquarius,1
234867,3519711,2004-08-03,"hotel  what a load of shit. this is most possibly one of the worst movies i have ever seen  in my life, and what makes it more annoying is that it had the potential to be rather good.  its a strange german film about a woman who gets a job at a hotel, where she also lives. the girl before her disappeared suddenly, and she becomes intrigued about why she left. this film is only 82 minutes long. if they added 30 mins of stuff that was actually interesting, this would be an alright movie. so many times you thought something was going to happen, and nothing didn't. i'm gonna tell you what happens cause i'm not spoiling anything, there's nothing to spoil. from the start, they set up an eerie atmosphere around a certain hallway that is so dark you cannot see the end. at one point there is a dream sequence where the woman walks down the hallway to find it leads out to the woods (which are behind the hotel), she then turns around and screams. thats it. nothing else. they could've shown the ""lady of the woods"" (this freaky doll thing which had some legend about a devil's cave in the woods which she haunts, and ppl disappear) attacking her or something, but no. when she finally does go down the hallway, what's there? oh just an end table. A FUCKING END TABLE!! why? why set that up for an hour and then give us a bullshit end table? in the end, she is locked out of the hotel when she is having a smoke outside, so she decides to walk through the woods (as you do at 11 at night). thats it. you assume she is killed. next shot is of a new girl applying for the job. the end. sure, if i wanted to analyse it, i could say that it was all the girl she worked with's fault, who killed her off, as well as the other girl before her, because they were liked more by the owner. but i don't want to analyse it. it was shit. end of story. do not, i repeat, do not waste your time with this film.   nine souls  this was a much anticipated film for me. i absolutely love the director's other film, blue spring (a great movie about japanese high school boys who compete for leadership of the other schoolkids), and had high hopes for this film. it didn't disappoint. the movie is about nine prison esacapees, their past lives, and their desire to fulfil their dreams. the little midget escapist, who was a doctor convicted for 'assisted suicide', was one of my favourite characters. having said that, all the characters were likable in one way or another. and i haven't laughed so loud in a cinema before seeing the ad for ""tightest pussy"" loan agency. great soundtrack too (blue spring also had a good soundtrack that i am still trying to get a hold of). i will definitely keep my eye on this guy for more great films. one of my highlights of the festival.",female,23,indUnk,Aquarius,1
234868,3519711,2004-08-01,"seeing i got home at 3 this morning, there was no way i cbf posting day 10, so here they are together. actually was two great days of movies, which is always good.   day 10      doppelganger  i don't even know how to explain this film. made by the same director who did bright future, its abotu a guy who has a doppelganger (of course :P), who does everything he has always been to scared to do. the movie changes genres and moods every five seconds, but is very enjoyable. and the ending is very funny.  on a slightly related topic, this movie made me think about all those things i always wanted to do, but either have too great a conscience, or am just too weak and shy to do. i was also thinking about these things cause on  the way to the cinema, i saw my evil ex, and wanted to go and hit him, but didn't cause at the same time i was upset enough being on the opposite side of the road to  him, i didn't really want to be any closer to him.   switchblade romance  i will simply sum it up  the plot like this: french lesbians, lots of blood, circular saw. the film is kinda like a mix between the remake of texas chainsaw massacre and tenebrae.. in fact there are alot of visual elements in this film that reminded me of dario argento's work. my favourite part would have to be when one woman's throat is cut, and you see it open as she breathes.. that was awesome. oh, and a stick wrapped in barbed wire is the coolest makeshift weapon ever. originally titled haute tension (literally meaning high tension), i don't really know why they had to change the name to something so corny for international release. high tension was much more appropriate a title.. my friend and i were tense the whole film, and both jumped at a number of occasions.   battle royale 2: requiem  i have this film on dvd already, but i wanted to see it on the big screen. in my opinion, it looks better on the small screen. in some of the scenes, the camera work is so jolty that i had a massive headache trying to focus. the film is generally weak overall in comparison to the first battle royale film, but its worth it for riki takeuchi's performance as the teacher.    day 11      get up!  japanese men singing james brown... need i say more? ok i will. the main two actors were pigsy and sandy in monkey.. yes thats got you wanting to see this movie now, hasn't it? a very funny film about a yakuza boss who is going to jail in two days, and wants to see his estranged daughter, who happens to manage a group of impersonators. meanwhile, james brown is in japan, and he is a big fan. his friend decides to kidnap james for a private performance for his friend.  paths cross and hilarity ensues. lots of fun. a must watch.   a tale of two sisters  korean horror/thriller film that kinda goes well, then changes mood completely, and then confuses the audience while it tries to explain everything. i think i've seen too many of these films in the past two weeks (and i'm taking loki to see ring 1 &2 on thur for his b'day :P). i am now permanently scared of closets/ built in wardrobes, and asian women with long black hair over their faces and bony hands. there is some beautiful shots in this film tho, great use of colour. but the house is freaky, and so is the stepmum with her almost vertical eyes (and why are all her clothes made of satin? no one owns or wears that much satin, not even hookers!), and the ghosty thing with the red eyes and swinging arm. ok i'm gonna stop now cause i'm reminding myself of all the things that freaked me out, just when i'm about to go to bed...   men suddenly in black  fucking funny hk comedy movie that takes off gangster films.  a group of guys set out to get laid and party while their wives are away in thailand. the first half of this movie is the best, then it kinda stops being funny when the wives come back into the picture. worth a watch just for the ""shootout"" at the cyber cafe. ( the cyber cafe had these awesome giant paintings of anime girls in fan service shots.. they were soo coool)  and that was my craji 48 hours.. sooo tired, and my eyes are a tad sunken... i'm gonna make the most of my 7 1/2 hour sleep tonight!",female,23,indUnk,Aquarius,1

241496,956611,2004-05-14,"""When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child.  When I became a man, I put childish ways behind me."" I am not a man.  Therefore, I still cling to a few of the precepts I clung to in my youth.  For example,   ""When you wish upon a star, ""Makes no difference who you are; ""Anything your heart desires ""Will come to you."" I have been thinking about wishing on stars lately.  I used to wish on a star when I was a kid.  I would wish that me and my brothers could turn into cartoon characters and live in a parallel universe whenever we wanted to.  Guess what?  It never happened.  I've had a lot on my mind lately.  Like guys.  Especially Michael Perry.  It's weird, but we never seem to like each other at the same time.  He liked me in Middle School, I like him when I was a freshman, he liked me at the beginning of this year but then started liking Jazz.  I kind of like him now.  The trouble is, he still likes Jazz.  Says he loves her.  He called me yesterday to talk, and we were on the phone for over an hour.  I don't know how long really.  But we talked a lot.  I've never had a guy call me before, and so it was kind of interesting.  I take that back...Mark called me a couple of times when we were going out (back when I was young and silly), but we never had anything to talk about.  Anyway, Perry and I had a lot to say, and so we talked forever.  I talked about Duncan, and how I'm getting over him, and he talked about the pain he's experiencing now with Jazz.  You see, Jazz broke up with him.  She said they were becoming ""co-dependent"".  Isn't that what a relationship is?  But anyway, Jazz seems to be scared off by anything that she enjoys.  I don't understand that about her.  Why can't she just pray about it and find her answers?  She wasn't at school today, or last Friday, so I called her house and asked her mom to have her call me back.  I don't know if she will or not, but I hope she will, because we need to talk.  Perry was supposed to call me tonight, but I guess he never found the time.  I like this font, so I'll stick with it.  Anyway, I'll go into how I got over Duncan.  I'm still physically attracted to him, but I find no interest in him personally.  That's no problem, I'm physically attracted to several guys and it doesn't mess me up.  I still admire Duncan for his dedication to his workouts and stuff, and for how he's in track and everything, but I really don't like him much anymore.  He makes crude jokes and acts like a jerk sometimes.  Perry informed me that he makes crude jokes a lot and I still talk to him.  I guess my answer for that is that he likes me, and likes to talk to me, and that's why I still talk to him.  Besides, he's getting better.  But that still doesn't explain David Sadler.  Who knows why I stopped liking him.  But I did.  Maybe it was the way he leapt into it.  He shouldn't have gone so fast.  He also embarrassed me.  That must be what it was.  He should have taken it slow, and then I might have started liking him.  But you see, he liked Jazz this year and now he likes someone named Jennifer Lowry (I think).  My mom's a sweetie.  She just brought me down a Diet Dr Pepper.  I love them.  The boys are watching ""Strange Brew"".  How annoying.  I like the movie, but I don't know how they can stand to watch it so often.  I wore a black dress today, and Stephen Watkins comes up and says ""Whose funeral is it?""  I replied, ""Yours.""  Anyway, I don't like Duncan anymore.  I'm not obsessed with impressing him, or showing him what an awesome person I am, or anything, so I think I'm over him.  Wouldn't it be funny if he started liking me now.  Doubtful, but it would be ironic.  Mom's breathing down my neck now.  She wants me to get off the computer so SHE can use it.  I just read those sentences to her and she made her little cute face, then decided to read a WinFax book.  She's trying to figure out how to talk over the terminal with Aunt Carol, who just got an IBM.  They've been faxing each other stuff like crazy.  Dad's fax machine is awesome, by the way.  I wonder if Noelle has a fax.  We could send each other stuff for like 14 cents.  That would be cool!  I feel kind of empty, not having a crush on anybody, and yet I feel free.  I'm single, and glad to be!  I think I'd like to get to know Noah Kinderknect, because he seems like a nice guy, but he's shy.  But I still have these silly feelings about Perry.  That's not good, because if I somehow got him interested in me again, it would hurt Jazz.  Plus, I might get hurt in the process.  So I'm going to stay away from that territory.  It's very strange that Perry liked me, because I never thought anyone would like me.  But he did.  I wonder if he ever will again.  My goal for my weight remains the same: to be able to wear biker shorts and a sports bra and look good.  That would be so awesome.  I would never wear them in public, but when I was working out I could and then I'd feel great.  But it seems like I'll never reach my goal.  Today Mom came home with a lot of chips and some French onion dip (my favorite).  I didn't totally mess up, but I did enough damage to where I won't be losing any more weight.  Yuk.  Anyway.  Enough about that.  I think Mom's going to be reading everything I write from now on.  She's silly.  Oh guess what!  We are trying to fax Aunt Carol a little certificate that says: ""Gift Certificate from the office of Dr. Jack Kevorkian, M.D.  Good for one visit only.""  Isn't that hilarious?  I love it!  I want to copy it and give it to people.  I should give one to Duncan, but he might get the wrong idea.  I'll give one to Perry.  He'll appreciate it.  Well, I think I'll stop now, because I really don't have much more to say.  Until whenever I write again...  -HA",female,26,indUnk,Gemini,1
241497,956611,2004-06-27,"I was so tired this morning. But I got up and came to school anyway. So here I am in 1st hour with nothing to do but write. And that's good!  A lot of changes have been made concerning Kung Fu class, and I will illustrate them. First, we moved to a new church, which is much nicer than the old one and doesn't charge us rent. Second, the class went from two nights a week to three. Which brings about point number three, a price increase. It went from $25 a month to $37.  A lot of people were unhappy about the new high price, saying they couldn't afford it. Since I'm not paying, my only problem was the Saturday morning class, because I want to stay home and watch cartoons like a slug. But I decided to go for it anyway, because I don't want to be a slug. I want to be a trim, fit human being.  The weirdest thing happened to me yesterday at Wal-Mart. AJ said to me, ""Heather, you wanna see Duncan? He's right over there."" And my heart SKIPPED A BEAT. That was the weirdest feeling I've ever had! I think I'm letting this crush get out of hand.  AJ and Ben had been talking to Duncan. He's not too happy about the new prices and he thinks it's unfair. I don't, because Si Fu has explained how he came up with the price. He's only charging a little more an hour now, and he's giving most of it to the church, maybe all of it, as a donation, because he feels that's what Christ smiles upon. I hope Duncan will come back to class. He didn't come because he didn't like the price. But he talked to Si Fu after class. He's taken Kung Fu for two years and he shouldn't quit now. Besides, if he quits I'll probably never become more than casual friends with him, although I've already told him I have a crush on him. I wonder what he thinks of me? He probably thinks I'm a dork. One thing I know...I gave him a Christmas card and he didn't give me one back. That's because he never gives Christmas cards back. He needs to work on that.  I don't know how I'm going to tape Darkwing Duck while I'm at Kung Fu. I guess I'll have to play with the VCR timer.  Later.   -HA",female,26,indUnk,Gemini,1
241498,956611,2004-06-27,"Today I woke up and the boys were already up. I had a Pop-tart and a bowl of Froot Loops. Later Dad made hash browns and sausage. 3 breakfasts! The boys went on a train ride with Jon and his friend. I typed my story, did work for dad and read books. We made a cool lunch (late.). I finished my Raphael story and started a Splinter and Leo story. They're cool. They boys got home but were at Jon's when Gma & Gpa came. They called me and I made them come home. They said Hi and then went back. We did junk with them and they left. The boys stayed at Jon's for 1 hour. Then me & AJ stole cookies & Ben used a slingshot. Then AJ played Mario 2. I watched.

I've just been reading this journal and it doesn't even  begin  to adequately describe my experiences here. It barely scratches the surface. Hopefully the sigs & messages in the back, along with my scrapbook, will help me to remember. In the meantime, I'll try to highlight my fave moments:    The Star Wars movies, July 16, 17, & 18. There were some tense times concerning those. ""Star Wars"" went off without a hitch, but ""Empire"" wasn't rewound & I barely found the projectionist in time for ""Jedi""! Whew! But I pulled it off. Now I'm basically famous. :)  Being named ""most radical"" in my hall, July 20. This occurred basically because I dyed my hair red. (Pink would be a more accurate term :).) Right now I have a moon tatoo on my neck. Nifty. But today the girls on my hall kinda flashed F2...I didn't really care to get in on that!! Oh well, can't be  totally  insane...:)  Hanging out with Shannon Caveman. She's basically my best friend here, and we've spent most of our time together. We're in astronomy, so we shared some cloudy cowfields.  Astronomy. We never,  ever  had a clear night in a cowfield. Ever. So we didn't get to do as much as we should have. But we can't control the weather...meanwhile, we watched tons of great movies, like ""2001"" and ""Stargate"" and ""Darkstar"" and ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"". (Klatuu Baratta Nikto, It's so quiet in here, Doolittle - Tastes like chicken! - The earth was without form, lifeless, and I was pleased - Let there be light! - I wouldn't do that if I were you...) - and of course we must have some Star Wars quotes: ""Will somebody get this big walking carpet outta my way?"" ""I have a very bad feeling about this."" ""It's not my fault!"" ""Free us, or die."" ""He's no Jedi."" ""Many of the truths we cling to depend greatly on our own point of view."" ""Strong am I in the Force...but not that strong."" ""Once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny--consume you it will!""  Hanging out with Matt, Mike, and Shannon.  Much to your surprise, I did NOT spend all my time sulking and drooling over guys. (It just happened that I only wrote in my journal during those times.) -- testing a new pen... -- DAMN! Stupid pens're running outta ink!!   Playing piano. I used music to express my feelings when I needed to--it was great.  Talking to Doug Griggs. My problem-solving teacher is  so   cool . I love him! He's insightful & thoughtful. His class has been very challenging!  :)  Seminar. It's been fun, once I got over Drew. Well, I probably won't be  totally  over him, but at least I'm not panting after him.   *INSERTED THOUGHT* : tonight (last night) was the Final Banquet. We sat w/Focus Area. I was across from Matt & next to Shannon. Mike was next to Matt. I was about to mention something about looking for cute waiters when Matt yelled at me, ""Stop lusting!"" I couldn't stop laughing for at least 5 minutes. See, spending time with Matt is  great fun !!   *ANOTHER INSERTED THOUGHT* : Matt wrote that he had something to tell me before we leave. I wonder what he meant. What could he say? I've thought that maybe he's fallen for me, and I wonder how I'd react. I like Matt, but I don't know if I like him  that way . I don't know if I'm hung up on looks, or what. But then again I don't know if that's what he wants to tell me or not.  I remember we were sitting on One-Tree-Hill one night talking about love. He said he's never been in love. I told him about my semi-Duncan love. He said that he was sad about never getting a close relationship with a girl. The thought entered my mind that I could learn over and kiss him and change his life. I know I blushed, and I certainly restrained myself. I don't even know if we like each other.  But anyway...:)    Picture-taking. I've managed to take some good pix, and I hope they'll be sufficient to help me remember GSP.  Scrapbook. I've been saving little items and these I've put in a photo album. I'll put photos in the front.  It'll be cool.   Gonna stop now!",female,26,indUnk,Gemini,1

In the abovementioned novel it is obvious when two people, are going to be married. There was no surprise at the end, but a happy end notwithstanding. I find that in my life, it is much harder, to perceive the affexions of a member of the opposite sex; their behavior is to me, very baffling. And so it is to no great surprise, that I am dateless this evening for the Showcase. It is not necessarily a fete requiring an escort, but on my part, the escort, will be sorely missed. I refer of course to a particular person, the attentions of whom I have no cause or right to expect, yet my heart longs after him. But after such a grievous mistake as has been made the evening previous, I doubt he pays me any mind at all, except occasionally to shudder, at my impudence and silliness.  I saw him today at dinner, but dared not join him, for I knew none that were in his company; approaching him, therefore, would be forward. I ate in solitude, trying not to allow my eyes, to wander to his table. This was all in vain, since not looking at him is quite impossible.  As I left the room I greeted him in the least civil manner without being rude, and his greeting of me, was matching in its abruptness and apparent lack of interest. I am certain, that he is quite worried to speak to me, as I have lowered myself in front of him so plainly and stupidly. I cannot realize that he may never return my affections, for my life has always been filled with unrealised dreams.  This being said, I would like to assure the reader, that I am perfectly happy with my station in life, and although it brings me sorrow to think that I may always be an old maid, I will try to do a service, to my position in society.   * * *",female,26,indUnk,Gemini,1

They're a lovely shade of blue-grey, speckled almost but gradual enough to be a fuzzy conglomeration of color.  When I came to this convention I didn't think I'd have much to write about. Turns out I have lots to say but no time to say it in!  Gotta go, but will return. -general assembly & dance time!  8:55- I'm back, & I'm not a happy camper. I was so excited before, but now I'm depressed. The thing w/Alex...I didn't get to run for president...I didn't win in Creative Writing. Barf! I must have next to no talent whatsoever. Occasionally I come off with a good line, but the rest of the time I must stink. (At least in timed writings!)  The reader doesn't know about the thing w/Alex, does he? He's a guy who kind of picked me up yesterday when I was depressed. I don't feel like going into the details at this position of the earth's rotation. Why? I'm just too depressed, bud.  So will I go to yonder dance? I haven't any idea. I was going to go & wear my green pants outfit, but now I'm not too sure.  Want to know why I hate pictures? I look ugly when I smile.  I really do. I have a fat face and when I smile, all the fat pouches up and hides my eyes. I would have decently-accentuated cheekbones if I wasn't so overweight.  And to think that this book was supposed to be a romantic tale of the life of a teenager. Tragedy sells, to be sure, but that's not the kind of autobiography I wanted to write. Well, that's life, and things never turn out exactly the way you expect them to. So I might go to that dance and actually have a good time. But most likely I'll just get more depressed, because I'm not a very outgoing person. Oh well--going to try on my pants outfit now. ---  9:13- I'm reverting back into the self-destructive hatred of Heather Aubrey of my sophomore year.  I hate myself! I was so rude to Alex, my writing sucks, Michael never really wanted to date me in the first place, I'm fat, I'm ugly, I'm stupid, and I cry over ignorant things. Like I'm crying now.  I'm such an awful person! No wonder poor Alex never tried to find me after last night.  My hideous ponch sticks out so far I look terrible in my beautiful pants outfit. My waist must be ten inches more around than it should be.  And I thought my creative writing piece was good.  Just shows that I'm stuck up to boot.  I want to call Mom. I think I'll try. No reason for her not to be home, unless she's at work :(  Can't. These phones don't call long-distance.  My butt is so huge! And my flabby face dwarfs the only good thing about me (my eyes), so even they're not beautiful.  I'm not going to eat dinner tonight. I need to lose weight. I'm so ugly. Maybe if I lose 15 pounds I'll look good, but it will probably take more than that. (15 off would only put me at 135, and the average girl of my height should weigh 115. I'm lame, huh, weighing 150 now. That's 35 pounds I have to lose, and of course, I can't do it.  I'm so lazy, dumb, procrastinative, unmotivated, lethargic...I'd need a Thesaurus to cover all the facets of my horrible self.  It's awful being this way and a perfectionist too. Being down on myself makes me even more unattractive than I already am.  Alex was such a nice guy! I'm such an idiot! He was caring enough to offer a depressed girl a place with him at dinner. (That would be me.) He was sweet enough to give someone a quarter to use the telescope out on the river.  He liked Star Wars!!  I'm such a fool!  I was consoling myself earlier with the thought that I'd never see him again, but that's cruel.  I need to go to the dance and find him. Sitting up here rotting over self-hatred isn't going to do me any good. I have to make amends for treating him the way I did!  11:27- I couldn't find Alex. Plus, I had a horrible time at the dance, per my prediction. It's probably my attitude. I expect to have a bad time, and it happens. Maybe someday I'll be able to go to a dance and actually enjoy it.  I'd have to be outrageously thin though, so I could ""shake it"" without flopping my fatrolls. Yuck! Michael says he'll teach me how to dance if I ever want to learn. I might take him up on that.  I was getting suicidal earlier. I hate that. Thought it stopped my sophomore year. But no, it started again this year. Great.  I think it's George coming. Perhaps my bad thoughts will go away. I'm already feeling better because I took 2 Midols.  Malinda (one of my 3 roomies) brought a guy back to the room. Just like I brought Alex back here yesterday. That's so sad.  I think I'll go try to find him again, & then mingle w/ my friends. He should be leaving tonight.",female,26,indUnk,Gemini,1

241512,956611,2004-06-27,"I am using all of these pages so I can catch up on the year. Right now I'm at Kitty's. We got her from the cancer place and took her back to her apartment. There, we watched MacGyver.  9:44 PM - Now I'm home. Earlier we went to Randall's, which is behind Little Caesar's across from Kitty's. We bought groceries for Kitty and then, when we got back, ordered a pizza. It was good, and while we ate we watched the very first Superman in the black-and-white series that eventually turned all color. It was neat.  Tomorrow is Dad's birthday. I am giving him an electric shaver with Mom & the boys that cost like 60 bucks. But he won't know that.  Well, now let me explain a bit about myself. I'm 13, but will turn 14 in May this year. I go to school at JCMS (Jessamine County Middle School) and am in 8th grade. I love my teachers. In fact, I always love my teachers.  I'm different from everyone else in that I'm smarter and weirder...or at least I show that I'm weird.  I like to write stories about the Ninja Turtles and Darkwing Duck.  I also like to write essays and poems. I was entered in the Governor's Cup Competition the past two years. In 6th grade I won 2nd place in Distric and Regional competitions but nothing at State. Then in 7th grade I won 4th in District and nothing in Regional. This year I hope to do better.  Another talent I have is drawing. I have been doing this since I was a small child, so I suppose practice helped me get so good. Drawing projects seem fairly easy to me, yet I set my goals so high. And then I'm discouraged if I don't do well.  I suppose I am a creative person. At the end of each school year, some classes give awards to the students. If there's a creative award, I get it. Well, I can't help it although it drives me crazy that that's the main word people associate with me.  Today's Thursday. Yesterday at church people wrote nice things about a certain person on that person's card which was taped to their back. When I read mine, shockingly none of them had written ""creative"". There was ""artistic"" though, and someone even wrote ""pretty"". I wonder if that person had the right girl.  I know I'm not pretty.  As for school, I am pretty well rounded in all subjects. I have Algebra 1, French, Social Studies, Shop, English (Advanced), Art, and Advanced Science, which is the hardest because no one in our class listens and then we fail the tests. But mostly I get A's. I got straight A's on my report card and midterms are coming out next Wednesday.  Maybe you'd like to know what I look like. I have long blond hair that reaches to my waist with bangs so long they're not bangs anymore. I have blue eyes, freckles, accented cheekbones, small eyes, and glasses. As for my body...I have a womanly frame but blubber covering it up.  Pet peeves- rudeness, Satan, people who make fun of classical music, etc.  I LOVE: pizza, the Turtles, Darkwing Duck, painting T-shirts, having parties, root beer, and playing the piano.  Oh.  Did I neglect to mention that I am a pianist?  Well I am. I've been playing for six years, '92 being the seventh. Come Nov. and I'll have reached 7.  I love to read too. My brothers, AJ, 12, and Ben, 10, aren't as interested in books as I am.  Je suis fatiguee (YAWN). It's 10:00. Actually 10:13. I'll need to get up early since there's school tomorrow.  Speaking of school, I need to tell who I hang with!  Surprisingly, the majority of my friends live in Wilmore, a tiny town near Nicholasville, where I live, which is a small town near Lexington. My friends live in Wilmore because their fathers are all going to Asbury College training to be ministers. When they're finished, the family will move away. This has already happened to me and will happen again.  First I'll tell you about Noelle Mitchell. She's my all-time BEST friend, but she lives in Maryland. Her dad's a minister, and she moved away.  We used to do so much stuff! We saw The Little Mermaid, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: Secret of the Ooze, and The Rocketeer in the theater.  Cool! But now she's gone. We call each other long-distance and write letters.  As for other friends, there are: Christy Bremer, who will be moving this year, Melodie Horst, moving, Kristanne Harden, not moving, Tareena ""Teeny"" Mulholland, not moving. Those are my basic friends, but there are lots more. I'm in Frnech with Teeny & Kristanne and we love to parler francais! Our teacher, Madame Fields, est formidable.  My mom is a wonderful person. She comes up with great party ideas. I had a sweatshirt painting party the 20th of Dec. and am planning on having a party where we'll make earrings.  Cool!  Well, I'm tired and there's school tomorrow. It's 10:25, January 9, 1992.  (Dix Vingtquatre, le neuf Janvier, mil neuf cent quatre-vingt douze.)  Well, gotta pray. Be back tomorrow. G'night.

261780,2866405,2004-02-25,"CLASS OF LOST KIDS...  Melanie Barnes La Trobe Secondary College, Macleod  February 23rd 2004  To the representative for the SRC Dear sir/madam,  Hello my name is Melanie Barnes and I am a currently a student at La Trobe Secondary College. I am writing to you to address the issue of increased absenteeism within our school. After recently reading an article published by the Herald Sun I think it is about time we do something to tackle this growing problem. Although I do believe truancy and absenteeism is a fairly global issue I do believe that there are a few things that we can do in this school to try and improve the situation.  As a student myself, I understand the struggle it can be sometimes to get out of bed in the morning and come to a place that you donât want to be at. Because a vast majority of the students donât enjoy being here I think that a few major changes need to be made to class curriculum. Certain classes Iâm sure are attended more frequently than others. This is because they capture that childâs interests. I believe that if we make the other classes catch the childâs interests they will attend these regularly as well.  Seems students are young they donât understand how important these years are and if they can find something better to do than go to school they will.  Thatâs why I believe we need to add some variety to the curriculum and make it more interesting. It becomes a problem because we constantly do the same thing âyear in year outâ. We go to school sit in a classroom and half the time our subject matters overlap and it appears useless to be at school, as well as boring so hopefully adding some variety will lower truancy numbers and help improve attendance but it might just be the wake up call that parents need.  As the Herald Sun Article suggests, parent's disciplinary actions are softening. They are putting petty things such as family shopping trips in front of their childâs schooling, not knowing the impact it is having. The softening attitudes are leading to the children taking more âsickiesâ than truly necessary. This also comes under parents letting their children sleep in then giving them the day off because of this. I think that maybe for the parents to realise what they are doing as Shadow Education Minister Victor Parton suggests, maybe their child welfare payments need to be reduced for those that cannot get their child to school frequently enough.  To take another angle on in maybe our recording mechanisms need to be looked at as well. Our current systems record the absenteeism rate of our students but it doesnât look at why. I think that the reasons for the child being away needs to be categorised and then recorded to enable a calculation at the end of each term and/or semester. After this a decision needs to be made to whether parents need to be contacted or the child requires special provision.  Well I thank you for taking the time to read my opinions and I hope that for future refrences for problems in this area you will take my ideas into consideration.  Respectfully, Melanie Banes",female,17,Student,Cancer,1

Anne is left very confused in the line up scenes as she doesnât remember the home and is frequently ignored in her questions of reason âBut why?â  	Anneâs good fortune for being chosen is represented in the book by a white doll that she receives from her white adoptive parents. The doll symbolises a new beginning, a new life with a sense of security, a good education and a good âwhiteâ upbringing.  	Although Anne doesnât suffer from the loss of her family throughout her childhood after discovering that her true heritage is aboriginal she becomes confused with who she is and she loses the identity that she had become.  	In scenes such as â to tan or not to tanâ and â Am I black or whiteâ we see her struggle with the concepts of being both black and white. In âto tan or not to tanâ her troubles are portrayed more as a joke. As she pulls at her milky white skin laughing at the fact she lays there smothered in coconut oil attempting to tan when she is black. That is until the end where the reality of her situation sets in.  	Both families escalate her problems as the pressure of making a decision between the two in â Am I black or whiteâ. In this scene it also shows her lack of understanding of her aboriginal family. She expects them to be more âat one with the landâ as she puts it and is rather disappointed to find that they are all crowded in to a commission flat.  	âAm I black or whiteâ is a scene that truly documents the pressures she is emplaced with as both families lay a guilt trip on her. Both want he to be with them and both make her feel that she has to earn her place as a part of the family,. It also gives off the impression that she is surrounded with people that want her love but she is somehow left feeling alone as the two families trap her both screaming the exact same thing at her.  	 All throughout Anneâs life her white adoptive parents have told her that she is special because they chose her, however in this she is frequently reminded that she should feel privileged as she is and should feel lucky and grateful to them for all that they have done for her  Again in âAm I black or whiteâ we get the feeling that the white family feels she should be appreciative as the mother bellows that sheâs given Anne everything and to leave would be breaking their hearts, The father is much more straightforward, questioning Anneâs appreciation and telling her that if she goes to her aboriginal family he wont take her back in. 	            The whites also bring shame to Anne for being Aboriginal in âAnneâs told she is aboriginalâ It is clear that they kept it from her but in saying that no one need ever know and that she only has to see her mum once they show that they are ashamed of her being aboriginal and they treat it as if it can easily be ignored.   Although Anne is deeply affected by all of this her hopes seem to rely on the chance that two families will learn to get along and she can live being both black and white. However deep down she knows this cannot ever happen. We see this directly as she addresses the audience in Anneâs scene and maturely tackles the problem. She is left still not quite knowing who she is, still struggling for her identity but she has grown enough to realise that she is lucky enough to have two families, and smart enough to love them both. And to live as Anne, whether that is being black or white.",female,17,Student,Cancer,1
261782,2866405,2004-02-12,"Hi peoples I'm going to be posting bits n peices of my english work here so...  RED DEATH  From the moment the keys were thrown away, one shy woman began to feel intimidated, a cold shiver ran up the inside of her spine. As this awkwardness grew inside her, she tried to tell others only to have them sneer at her pathetic insecuritiesâ¦ after. All what was there to worry about when Red Death was outsideâ¦ 	As they all rejoiced in escaping red deaths wrath, the celebrations continued long into the nights. As Prince Prospero and his thousand-man army enjoyed their women, wine and entertainment the shy woman wondered through the crowd, and as she watched everyones joy and sense of victory, a smirk emerged on her face. 	During these parties, she kept a close eye on the Prince. Her passion towards him growing by the day. As much as she loathed his confidence and sureness, she was drawn in by the power of his handsomeness and his courage. Shy envied the object of his affections Lady Amelia,  she watched her as she ever so gracefully flirted with him, but pulled away drawing him in more every time and kept thinking that it should be her. 	Weeks passed and the celebrations continued, incessant laughter spread through the castle. With the prince as their leader, they had all survived and red death was all but forgotten in their drunken nightly escapades.  The shy girl had remained unheard and unseen especially by the prince. Nightly as everyone slept, she would sit in her room gazing out at the night sky and wait. 	One morning everyone in the castle all awoke to quite a scuffle. And like a little herd of school children everyone including the shy girl followed the crowd to this magnificent elegant ballroom. There stood Prince Prospero on top of the main feasting table with a massive smile upon his face. He took a deep breath and the enormous crowd did with him. âIn three weeks it is the anniversary of my great mother Queen Sylvias death and since no one had entered this castle before us after the devastating tragedy in three weeks we will have her wake and celebrate my motherâs term as queen. On this day I will also officially take my seat in the royal throne and become King Prosperoâ bellowed Prince prospero  Shouts and cheers of glory came flooding through the crowd the excitement began to stir. Prince Prospero continued âTo celebrate we are going to have a masked ball in this very ballroomâ Ooooohs and aaaaaaaahs emerged from the guests as their eyes circulated the ever-elegant ballroom. Chandeliers filled with crystal and gold encrusted hung from the rafters. 	As the prince dismissed the eager crowd conversations about what they were going to wear, shoes make up and hair began amongst the females. There were two that were looking forward to it most of all though. Lady Amelia and the very shy woman, both in the back of their minds thinking that it was the night they were going to make the Prince theirs.  PART 2 RED DEATH PART 2- THE MASKED BALL  Anticipations were growing, the ball was to be tomorrow night. In his room the prince was trying on his custom made outfit and enjoying a glass of chardonnay when he heard a shriek from down the corridor. 	 The prince sent a few of his men to investigate and as the men neared the area which the scream was coming from they gasped in shock and hurriedly ran back to the prince. Trying to explain the men couldnât speak, as they stuttered and fell over their words the prince became frustrated âworthless foolsâ he exclaimed and went to see for himself. As he approached the room he slowed his footsteps, creeping the door open he turned to see a blood covered wall engraved in which was his name. The Prince fainted. Aware that what he saw could not possibly be true, was the Red Death here? 	When the Prince came to the blood on the wall was gone without a trace, the men tried to comfort him but they thought him a little delusional because the name they saw engraved in the wall was not the Princes but the deceased Queen Sylvia. After hearing this news the Prince started to panic. He tossed and turned in his four post bed all night. Could his dead mother still be here? Is the castle really haunted or is she here only to plague revenge on her assassinator? He rested his eyes but slept with one eye open all night. 	 	 In a midst of all the confusion in the middle of the night the shy girl had began wondering around the castle in search of something special. The Queens Old room. As she crept around she finally found two massive big doors that she hadnât noticed before, she had found it, the room the Queen was assassinated in. Marvelled by the beauty the shy girl found the room just as it had been left, beautiful covered in jewels, but as she wandered near the Queens bed she gasped. Here on the bed lie the most magnificent ruby she had ever seen. Set in a heart shaped necklace she picked it up and placed it around her neck. âHeâs sure to notice me nowâ she exclaimed as she looked at her reflection in the mirror. Just as she placed it around her neck she heard a shriek from down the corridor, she ignored it and continued marvelling at her reflection in the mirror. Hurriedly she scurried back to her room with a brilliant glowing smile upon her face. 	The next morning the castle was a buzz with the news of the night before. Many were worried it signalled the return of their all but forgotten red death  but both the shy girl and Lady Amelia had other things on their mind and were laughing and joking in their anticipation for the ball. Both had devised plans to capture the Princeâs heart. The shy girl only hoping that the red gem, as she had appropriately named it the hope ruby would help her in her endeavours.  RED DEATH â PART 3  The night was approaching quickly, and everyone was getting done up in their elegant gowns. The shy girl had an elegant crimson and black number, just perfect to match the beautiful gem she was wearing around her neck. Lady Amelia was covered by diamonds and wearing a gorgeous gold dress to suit the occasion.  	Everyone gathered in the dining room. Lady Amelia determined to have all the attention wandered in fashionably late. As she entered the room everyoneâs head turned, including the prince. She was surrounded by a circle of admirers, the shy girl who had been ignored up until this point decided to remake her entrance, full of confidence. With the hope ruby on display she gracefully entered the ballroom. This time however she did get a reaction, gasps of shock and amazement at her beauty arose from the crowd and the Prince. Who was this young beauty and why had he never noticed her before.  	Well Amelia didnât like this, how dare this unknown character take away her limelight, she pushed through the crowd eager to see who it was. When she got to the front she stopped dead in her tracks for this beautiful girl was none other than her little sister, Jacinta. And as Jacinta noticed the look of surprised the very same smirk come about her face as did the very first night in the castle. 	Amelia was the really jealous type, she noticed the red ruby around her sisterâs neck and recognised it as the one she saw lying on the queenâs bed. Knowing that she could not say that she two had been in the queenâs room to see this she ever so sarcastically asked Jacinta where she could have got such a gorgeous piece of jewellery.  With an ease of confidence about her she said that it had belonged to her mother, their mother and she had found it beside her after she died of the Red Death. 	Amelia without thinking questioned this, accusing Jacinta of stealing it from the queenâs room. At this remark everyone stopped and turned to face the bickering siblings. The prince stepped forward to try and sort out this dilemma between the two only to be knocked out of the way as Amelia flew at her little sister. âYou were always the ugly one how dare you try and ruin my nightâ Amelia screamed. As she got nearer to her sister she flung out her arms in hope of stealing the hope ruby. Jacinta full of rage screamed, it was a scream that could have trembled the castle walls and as she did this the crowd gasped, as a ray of light shone from the ruby placing the entire kingdom in a trance it directed itself towards Amelia. Amelia began to laugh, louder and louder âyou donât know what your doing Sis you have no ideaâ She chuckled as Jacinta continued to scream.  They collapsed. Slowly but surely Jacinta again began to rise. Amelia was left on the floor, drowning in her own blood just as red death had left so many others. The frightened crowd new nothing to what was going on. Suddenly still with the ruby around her neck Sylvia raised off the ground. âyou donât deserve him skankâ she seemed to scream in her own voice but her eyes began to turn red and the next time she spoke it was loud, it was furious and her eyes lit up like they were on fire. âIâm backâ said the voice with a giggle the prince immediately knew what was going on. âYou thought you had gotten rid of me didnât you sonâ and there was another giggle. At these words the prince himself became furious. His mother, in Jacintaâs body was trying to reap revenge on him as she had tried to on the whole prospero kingdom. Grabbing the nearest thing he could find, a candelabra. Jacinta / Sylvia looked up at him rather oddly and in this brief moment he took a chance and threw it at her, aiming at the necklace.  	Time almost seemed to freeze as it travelled along in the air, everyone sat there mouths open and as it connected they all gasped. But it didnât connect with the ruby, He missed, it hit the possessed Jacinta straight in the head. The prince saw the opportunity and took it lunging at her. The two tackled on the ground for a while until the ruby began dislodged and slid across the dining room floor. No- one knew what to do. The queen began to scream out â it is me your queen my son here murdered me to take the throne please protect that stone it is all that keeps me here todayâ  The prince counteracted this screaming back â donât you see that she is the red death, the stone is anyway havenât you noticed it had not taken any lives until my mother and this stone re-emergedâ the crowd stood there bewildered until a third plea, one that they had not expected emerged. It was the voice of young Jacinta pleading for help.  As both the crowd and Jacinta, well the Queen   seemed to be paralysed the prince dived towards the ruby and swung at it. He smashed that beautiful gem into thousands of little pieces. Releasing the spell on Jacinta and destroying what was left on both his mother and the Red Death. He ran up to Jacinta who was lying on the floor, drained checking to see if she was fine. But as he looked at her, and gradually at everyone else in the room he saw blood leaking out of ears, eyes and noses of everyone, and as the fear began to run through him he reached up and touched his nose. It was bleeding.",female,17,Student,Cancer,1
261783,2866405,2004-03-10,"DESCANSOS â THE ROBBERY 	 Never shall I forget that cold shiver that ran down my spine the moment we pulled in the drive or the absolute fear of what was to come. I will never forget my innocence and young confusion. Why would anyone do this?  Still in my head I can picture the house.I can clearly remember my first steps inside and how it all felt like a movie. I guess it hasnât been until almost this moment that I have forced myself to look upon this in any other way than how it is in my memory. I can now see the dramatic impact that this event had on not only me but my entire familyâs life. 	 A lot of questions arose that day. How could you be robbed in broad daylight in the middle of the afternoon on a main street? What reasons did they have not to take our main appliances the Nintendo the TV? Why had they targeted my mums one â off jewellery? That day influenced a lot of change. It was the first time I had heard slanderous comments from my father towards my mother, the first time I had understood secrets may lie beneath my familyâs surface and it was probably among one of the first times I questioned the way the world worked. But the irony lies in my original reaction. âShit my CD players goneâ  That year was a fairly miserable one. Two days after Christmas all my presents were stolen, along with my sense of security. My first CD player was a big deal. My friend since birth, god sister, and best mate and I had received the same one. I had played with hers but was not yet to put a CD in mine, and it was gone. I was devastated, shattered as all my jewellery and my expensive materialistic items were gone. I was too young and naÃ¯ve to see the big picture though, my real loss. My sense of security.  I can still remember how cold that first night was. A chilly breeze glided through the house as our front door was broken and refused not only to lock but to even shut. I remember not being able to sleep properly. I remember awakening only to the screeching of angry adult voices â¦my parents, well my mum and stepfather they were angry, but not at the fact we had been robbed. They were angry with each other!  The screaming and yelling I heard during these nights will stay in my memories forever. I honestly thought that they were going to break up and I would be left again with my mother.  The time was odd. The police believed that it was the arrival of my father and I that had warned the burglars away. But I myself didnât like that idea, for it meant that they were there when I was a very chilling thought.  The absence of my logical thinking was clearly present at the time. I couldnât even remember the police phone number. And yet it was on the damn phone, as a big sticker. I remember searching through my room, happy that most of my stuff remained. My TV was there, my âtreasures of the earth gem collectionâ remained but more importantly my new CDâS. Only now I had nothing to play them in.  Although at the time it was a fairly traumatic experience, a lot of good things did arise from the situation. Over the following few months it appeared that  Mum and Dad resolved some issued that they had seemingly been hiding from each other for quite some time. My sister and I became closer as we were forced to move house and share a room. Even though we were at each others throats all the time I know that our bond grew. 	 And I guess I was forced to grow up. I had to be strong as it seemed everything and everyone around me was falling apart. But maybe the most relevant thing to me at the time that changed was that I filled my ever since birth, kind of god sister and really good friend with absolute envy. I had received a new CD player. It had a three disc spin and it was better than hers. And I could play with it whenever I wanted.",female,17,Student,Cancer,1
261784,2866405,2004-04-25,"ok i understand that for alot of people this will not make much sense, it is afterall my memories but anyway here you are.  I REMEMBER  I remember the very first day I came to school with last years year 12âs gone. Our spot felt so empty. After a few shed tears I took a look around at the graffiti they left behind and thought the year through. I remember when Leigh and Gene wrote a song about Muniur to the tune of an old Tupac song and how we made them sing it over and over till we were almost in tears of laughter. I remember the day me & john were trying to light our cigarettes. It was windy and the flame wouldnât light. Everyone was screaming our name, we were ignoring them because we just wanted to get them lit. We ended up looking up, just to see Mr McMahonâs face glaring at us.  No- one would let it go. We were picked on for weeks. I remember all the birthdays and the time it took us to the money for all of the presents, not to even mention the parties. But there was a new pain in the arse every month. I remember each and every one of us chucking our guts up at one time or another. The pats on the back and holding each others hair back. I remember those evil passion pop bottles and us doing somersaults in Kaylaâs spa. I remember Kimbo almost falling asleep on the pool cue, Kaylaâs exorcist style chunder, Beck almost electrocuting all of us, Brizzy always thinking she knows best, Sideshow beck, sophisticated mama, enemy, fresh and the list goes on. They are all classic people and classic moments.  I remember everyone at my debutante ball in the middle of the dance floor jumping up and down to Khe Sahn only to have the clips on my dress undo and the whole front of my dress to fall down. I remember all of us in our drunken glory and some of the surprising hook-ups.  I remember Inverloch , Iâm not even going to go into that one but I remember that no matter what we were doing it was always a blast. I remember how much fun school was each and everyday.  I remember the good times, I try to forget the bad but I do know that life goes on. It almost feels like the end of an era, but itâs ok. I donât see them all as much and school sucks now but I will always have my memories and I will never forget.",female,17,Student,Cancer,1
261785,2866405,2004-05-16,"As part of our year 12 coursework we are required to analyse a current issue in the world. our teacher Mrs Blakey has chosen the GBH issue for us to tackle. This is an analysis of a few articles we had to tackle.  ARTICLE ANALYSIS - GBH MELANIE BARNES  The issue of whether rave parties should be banned has been in circulating in the media because of recent overdoses on the illicit drug GBH at Two Tribes. Three articles that directly address this issue are â We canât rant about Raves â,  â call for dance party ban rejected and âone in five try killer drug GBHâ which were all published in the herald Sun the week following two tribes. In an article entitled â We canât rant about raves.â Jim Stynes argues that banning these major rave parties will only earn the Government a pat on the back and will stop us even prevent this problem from happening. He believes to attack the problem we need to focus on the reason people take these drugs, and what they need to gain motivation to live in their lives. To support this view Stynes points out that at rave parties there is medical care but at other smaller parties in which these people will be forced to attend in substitution of raves there is not, and time is everything with overdoses the medical attention provided could be a matter of life and death.  Stynes clearly supports rave parties. He says that he witnessed 20,000 people escaping their lives to come together and enjoy the music saying that raves are an almost tribal experience where people of varying backgrounds can feel a part of something greater, like they belong.  In separating the GBH problem from the rave party scent Jim Stynes does Stynes does not deny the problem of GBH needs to be dealt with. He makes it clear that the government needs to identify the real reasons young people are taking these drugs and take actions to tackle these problems. Stynes effectively argues that understanding the underlying issues in our young peoples lives is key. Saying that to adopt the approach of harm minimalisation, it is vital to understand what our young are thinking and feeling. He backs this up saying that it is inevitable that many young people will experiment with drugs but that those who do it on a regular basis must be missing something in their lives and that this is where we need to put our focus.  He states that it is not the time to hide from the problem. Stynes as the co-founder of the Reach Foundation has worked a lot with young people and obviously cares for their well-being. He has insight into the problems these young people have that cause them to resort to drugs. Thus resulting in him believing that we need to make sure young people healthy enough to make the right choices. In another contrasting article â Call for dance party ban rejectedâ Christine Caulfield takes quite an apposing view. She presents the argument that rave parties encourage young people to take drugs. Caulfield uses the example of Mr Brooker who lost his best friend to drugs to demonstrate that there is a case to shut down these rave parties. What Caulfield fails to mention is that the people that suffer from drug overdose are a vast minority. Only 10 out of a massive 20,000 ravers suffered overdoses while the rest went about having a great night. In another article entitled âone in five try killer drug GHBâ Patrick OâNeil and Christine Caulfield once again tackle this hotly debated issue. Despite the misleading headline the duo make a solid argument that shutting down rave parties would harbour devastating consequences as it would only drive the problem underground. To support these views they spoke to earth core coordinator Pip Darvall and the director of the harrowing dance drug movie âOne Perfect dayâ Paul Currie. Pip darvall questions what happened to a draft version of âA Guide to running safe rave Partiesâ stating that running safe rave parties is a better solution is a better solution to shutting them down entirely. This article also aims to raise awareness in young people in the dangers of GBH, as does Paul Currieâs movie âOne Perfect Dayâ Mr Currie said that the recent two tribes Speculation affirmed the films importance and he hoped it lifted the lid on what was really going on. The article also distributed some useful information about GBH. Although most people do know that GBH is a clear odourless liquid not many know that it is often distributed in clear sachets in a variety of bright colours to increase its appeal among young users. Paul Currie believes we need to bring all the facts into the limelight. Overall all the articles present strong views against the problems of drug use and concern about the impact of GBH. However they do have different views against what action needs to be taken to prevent further drug overdoses. I strongly believe that demonizing rave culture is not the answer and that no matter who may be right or wrong action needs to be taken.",female,17,Student,Cancer,1

The headline is one that automatically gets us intrigued. I think it is meant so as we see Ms Hawkins as a rather animal on show, purely a piece of meat.    Q2) What is Robin Rileyâs main contention?  To argue that beauty pageants send a bad message out to the public that you have to be beautiful to be successful. And that beauty pageant are a sexually driven waste of time.   Q3) List the words and phrases that she uses to support her anti-pageant view?  -	âThatâs basically all they are, window dressingâ -	 Cattle markets -	 Meaningless title and a useless crown -	âIt was all about looksâ -	 Exploitative -	âHeretical display of exploitation and decadenceâ  	 Q4) Explain how the words and phrases help her convey her view. What is the tone? What issues does she highlight?  The tone of the article is rather satirical. With comments relating to other peoples opinions being rather sarcastic and the overall put downs towards these people she seems rather argumentative with her view She highlights the past contestants and winners and some of their pathetically ditsy answers to a few of the questions asked. Opposing the view that pageant are not just about looks she laughs at the statement by rival contest Miss Worldâs in that they promised a contest about beauty with purpose. She is being critical of everything to do with beauty pageants.        Q5) Write a short response to riley supporting pageants.  Dear Ms Riley, 	After recently reading your article entitled âQueen of the cattle marketâ I am really disappointed with your pessimistic view towards beauty pageants.  Although I do appreciate your personal opinion I found that you actually shot yourself before you began. Stating that some people see it as harmless fun was reasonable. And you effectively argued about that but when you stepped towards freedom of choice you lost it. Freedom of choice is something as Australians that we have and you are right, she was just exercising her right. Although I do agree with you in the term that beauty pageants are pointless there are many people in the world that disagree. Some of these people even dream about winning these âcattle marketsâ as you like to call them. And who are we, who are you to shut these peopleâs dreams down. There are many other worse occupations in this world. I find that quite a few other accepted jobs in the community could be easily scoffed at too. Yours for example. You are getting paid to criticise other people in the world, criticise their decisions. Just as Donald Trump has no right to judge a womanâs beauty, I donât believe you have the right to question their intellectual integrity. So as much as I do respect you opinion I think that laughing at these peopleâs dreams is not the answer.  	Melanie Barnes",female,17,Student,Cancer,1

Before I begin I need to apologise the wrath my cowardess actions may be causing you. But I had to go. If not to run from the war to run from my life and the confined space I felt like I was trapped in. Being drafted from the war frightened me. I know it seems kind of obvious but please acknowledge the fact that this is difficult to admit to myself let alone admitting it to a few of the only people in this world that I admire. Because of this I am sorry if I have disappointed you.  	I do not understand the war at all. Infact I consider it to be rather useless. I laugh at the fact these people think they are fighting for freedom. It is all political lies and a huge cover up, for what I do not know but my beliefs lie firmly against the war. When I sleep at night I do think of those men. Fighting for their lives with no clue what they are fighting for. It saddens me and knowing that I may soon be one of these men leaves me paralysed.  	I do not know what I will do. Please do not try to contact me. I wrote this letter to you to assure you of my safety I hope you can respect me to give me my space for I need some more time.

261788,2866405,2004-03-22,"When days just dont seem right this is my peice to cheer me up. I dont qiute know why. The theme for a modern day romeo and juliet arose from a writing assignment in year 10. And hey this is what i come up with. Inspired my an ex love at the time love really sucked  A MODERN DAY ROMEO AND JULIET  A modern day Romeo and Juliet, what a joke. There will never be such a thing for is anyone in todayâs âmodernâ selfish world, selfless enough to believe in a love that will precede life in itself and give up	all future years of aspiration for the off chance that nothing great will ever happen again because their so called âtrue loveâ is not by their side? If you ask me, or anyone else around me not caught up in the dream themselves. NO CHANCE. Love is simply overratedâ¦ just like sex. You spend youâre the  whole of your younger years looking forward to some fairytale, get to where you begin thinking about it and find yourself  in the unfortunate situation too earlyâ¦ then arising with the wisdom that you could only dream that you had a minor part beforehand. And before too long its all your life is revolved aroundâ¦ what a drag.   Yet another fairytale from your childhood that can and will be shattered in an instant. Then in less than a year your life could feel destroyed. Not knowing what direction your life is heading in, what corners will confront you or whether you make the right decision in the forks lying ahead in the road. Throughout it all in later years it is all but too depressing to reminisce those teenage years because in the years you are destined to make some of the biggest and hardest decisions of your life. You are also persuaded by the pressure that these will be your last few years of freedom. To be free from restrictions, for being either too young or too old, Too young to comprehend anything which in some form has a major significance in the world or too old with too many responsibilities. Over the phase where the world is âat your feetâ And apparently by the way they react over the little things, having the weight of the world on their shoulders. Yet in theory and practice, the time of tender kisses, arising maturity and the apparently carefree and joyous times of experimentation seems to be the hardest to get through, but in the same context the most enjoyable. Which brings me back to Romeo and Juliet. Why? Why is it that in the midst of everything else going on do we have to love? To fall in love with someone who may or may not love you as deeply as they claim, but if it is, not understanding when and how you would like it placed. Again this refers back to the selfish views we, as modern civilians have today. But ask yourself are there  any other perks to âloveâ, is their any point in it if the only gratification we get is knowing that we love and are loved in return? I ask myself sometimes why that isnât enough, or even sometimes why it is. But really there is no possible answer for there is no logical, mathematical, or even rational explanation to love. The only conclusion I can make is that I wish the world was all it seemed that short year ago. Happy, carefree and even in love with nature and the manufactured demise of the heavens.

267886,3609838,2004-08-02,"Hello WERLD:  G.O.A.L.S. is a ""Gathering Of African Americans in Library Service."" It is a professional networking organization that caters to the professional development and enhancement of African American librarians and library workers in the Philadelphia area. We also garner support for and from anyone who works in library service within the African American community.  See my thing is this: affluent communities will always have access to information and those who are commissioned to bring in that information will always be top notch professionals, supported by the best of the best, so to speak.  In urban neighborhoods, this tends to not be the case. Information professionals are not respected, we are not professionally nurtured by our employers. We don't receive information that is applicable to our unique clientele, we tend to get information that is for ""everyone"" and we have to work underground to get to our people informationt that they will respond to.   Just as emergency services and educational services are slow filtering into the urban ""hoods"", so is information services. And without efficient, high quality access to information, it is next to impossible to adequately navigate oneself in this world.  Enters G.O.A.L.S.  G.O.A.L.S. is a mechanism through which black librarians, library workers and others who work in black libraries or information outlets that cater to black clientele can hear their own voices, filter in outside information that they can take back to the hood or their clientele who can use the information. G.O.A.L.S. achieves empowerment of the African American information professional and therefore the empowerment of black people in terms of their information needs.  This organization started two years ago, almost to the date, in Florida at a professional black librarians' conference, held by the Black Caucus of the ALA (BCALA). Myself and my colleague/friend, Angela Willie, were talking in the pool of all places about starting a BCALA Chapter in Philadelphia. I was like: ""Let's do this!""   When I got back to Philly, my mentor, Helen Miller, suggested that I do this ... she said I was the one to do it. So I did.  I got my best buddy/colleague, Darren Cottman on board, along with another mentor of mine, Patricia Kelker, who was a long standing BCALA member and on BCALA's Executive Board ... and we created the first Gathering of African Americans in Library Service meeting at the Free Library of Philadelphia, in November 2002.   Since then we have grown by leaps and bounds, and will continue to do so. And you wanna know why? Because black librarians in Philadelphia are AMAZING PEOPLE. They are well traveled, educated, experienced ... open-minded, excellent writers and scholars, and committed to working in libraries that caters to their people. And if they are not working in an urban library, they are committed to representing their culture to its fullest, without compromise, wherever they are, whatever they are doing. And G.O.A.L.S. lives and breathes because of these awesome people. And it's a no-brainer that when all of them get together ... work together ... share information ... when they GATHER .... INCREDIBLE THINGS HAPPEN.  If you want to learn more about G.O.A.L.S. check out: www.phillygoals.org.  Over and out!",female,38,Museums-Libraries,Libra,1

But now, Iâve grown, Iâve set my foot in real waters where Iâve realized the difference between a dream and a reality. I would have to admit that Iâm not the type of girl every man is dreaming of. With occasional breakouts, a bulging tummy, bad hair days almost 6 times a week, without the Snow White type of complexion and definitely not the supermodel physique I wished for, it makes me a tad insecure. At the same time, a lot less closer from my dream of prince charming falling madly in love with me. So now, my real life journey begins. It was a stagnant weekend when his best friend invited me to watch a movie with them. The movie was a chick flick that had so much publicity that made me nosy about it although I was pretty sure that that certain flick was just a waste of money. It was the kind of movie that even stupid people could already conclude the ending for it was labeled as the âway-too-impossible-because-no-rich-man-could-love-a-maidâ kind of movie. But since, I was curious and didnât have anything to do that Saturday, I decided to go with them. During the ride, we werenât talking that much. I was a bit shy not knowing the reason behind it. When we arrived at the ticket booth, we saw that we were half an hour early than the next showing so we decided to eat a light dinner. My other friends led him and me to this fast food chain but it seems that my appetite wasnât hungry for that genre of food. I just stood there, hesitating to order anything for I was really craving for sweets!!! Luckily, he was looking at me. It seems that he read my mind as he asked me if I wanted to eat somewhere else. I agreed as we left our other friends eating burgers and fries and then he surprisingly took me to this bakeshop full of mouthwatering cakes and pastries that are to-die-for. I ordered my favorite cake as he ordered his and then got a chair and awkwardly waited for our food to be arrived. âSabi ko na nga ba, gusto mo kong maka date eh!â I joked to ease the awkwardness creeping towards the both of usâ¦ he laughed and rode with it as that single joke broke the silence between our 2 souls. I was seated facing him, while I kept on psyching myself not to show any emotions of kilig or any other feelings related to it. Our food arrived shortly and we ateâ¦  	We had a pleasant conversation and I found it difficult to hide the smile in my face while we were talking. I couldnât interpret whether he was being super friendly or just plain sweet. Though I wanted to believe in the latter, I decided to lower my expectations as I told myself âWag ka na!! Walang gusto un sayo!!!â so I just had a nice talk as little by little, I learned some info about him. After quite a while, I saw our friends outside waiting for us. I looked at the time and realized the movie was about to start. We took our last sip on our iced tea and went straight to the movies.  It was kind of him to be seated right next to me for the next 2 hours. I felt so protected and so comfortable to be near him. It has only been a month since Iâve really known him but I felt safe knowing his presence was near me.  As I watched the âCinderella movieâ I couldnât help but wonder if it could also happen to me. I was just a plain simple girl, slowly falling in love with a guy I know I couldnât have. Based on my sources, I know a handful of girls are crazy for him, including me, and that he still hasnât had any girlfriends, which made me assume either he wasnât the commitment type of guy or whether he is just too picky when it comes to dating women. Either way, I had no chance. I know it isnât bad to dream but if Iâd keep on dreaming, I know it would only hurt me.   	I was confused whether or not to believe in my childhood dream of prince charming or to just forget about it and live life as it is supposed to be. If a mere person wrote that movie, then maybe, it could still happen with a real person like me. Was I asking for too much or was it O.K? The very thought of it maims me.          The movie ended just exactly the way I expected itâ¦ He fell in love with her despite of her imperfections and a low stature compared to his. They married and lived happily ever after blah blah blah blahâ¦ we both went out of the movie house as I followed his lead. He looked at me and asked, âWhat can you say?â you know what I said? âIn reality, a guy like that could NEVER fall in love with a girl like her!â he smiled and said, âI agree!â  His words were so powerful that it rang over and over and over again in my head. Sadly, the movie was just like us. He was a highly statured man while I was just a maid. He could never see the way I see him. He will never look at me like the way I look at him.   	After the movie, he treated me out on a cup of ice cream and we sat together with his best friend. I felt the tickle of the midnightâs air brushing my skin. I looked at the vast sky as I waited for a falling star to appear so Iâd wish upon it. He saw that I was quiet as he talked to me as we exchanged out thoughts that night. After the last spoon of ice cream and a couple of chitchat, they decided to drop me homeâ¦ âThank you.â I said with a compelled smile. âI had a great time.â It was during that time that I slowly saw their car vanish into thin air.   Now youâre asking me what happened next?!? No, I didnât leave a glass slipper so that heâll come back. I didnât turn into a mermaid to swim distant oceans just to see him, nor did I ride a magic carpet just to tell the whole world how much I loved him. I just went straight to bed, thought about him and told myself; âYouâre a big girl nowâ¦ and itâs about time you let go of that little Cinderella dreamâ¦â",female,16,Student,Scorpio,1

269317,3754226,2004-08-03,"The difference between the âMEâ then and the âMEâ now is that I once believed in fairytalesâ¦ I once thought that Cinderella stories were easy to charm and that with just a flick of an eye, it could totally happen. But now, Iâve grown, Iâve set my foot in real waters where Iâve realized the difference between a dream and a reality. I would have to admit that Iâm not the type of girl every man is dreaming of. With occasional breakouts, a bulging tummy, bad hair days almost 6 times a week, without the Snow White type of complexion and definitely not the supermodel physique I wished for, it makes me a tad insecure. At the same time, a lot less closer from my dream of prince charming falling madly in love with me. So now, my real life journey begins. It was a stagnant weekend when his best friend invited me to watch a movie with them. The movie was a chick flick that had so much publicity that made me nosy about it although I was pretty sure that that certain flick was just a waste of money. It was the kind of movie that even stupid people could already conclude the ending for it was labeled as the âway-too-impossible-because-no-rich-man-could-love-a-maidâ kind of movie. But since, I was curious and didnât have anything to do that Saturday, I decided to go with them. During the ride, we werenât talking that much. I was a bit shy not knowing the reason behind it. When we arrived at the ticket booth, we saw that we were half an hour early than the next showing so we decided to eat a light dinner. My other friends led him and me to this fast food chain but it seems that my appetite wasnât hungry for that genre of food. I just stood there, hesitating to order anything for I was really craving for sweets!!! Luckily, he was looking at me. It seems that he read my mind as he asked me if I wanted to eat somewhere else. I agreed as we left our other friends eating burgers and fries and then he surprisingly took me to this bakeshop full of mouthwatering cakes and pastries that are to-die-for. I ordered my favorite cake as he ordered his and then got a chair and awkwardly waited for our food to be arrived. âSabi ko na nga ba, gusto mo kong maka date eh!â I joked to ease the awkwardness creeping towards the both of usâ¦ he laughed and rode with it as that single joke broke the silence between our 2 souls. I was seated facing him, while I kept on psyching myself not to show any emotions of kilig or any other feelings related to it. Our food arrived shortly and we ateâ¦   We had a pleasant conversation and I found it difficult to hide the smile in my face while we were talking. I couldnât interpret whether he was being super friendly or just plain sweet. Though I wanted to believe in the latter, I decided to lower my expectations as I told myself âWag ka na!!

Sheâs just so coolâ¦ why canât all women be like that?!..But deep down, if you really think about it (which you probably donât because to you, the situation between the two of you isnât important enough to merit any real thought), you know that itâs really not fair. You know that although she would never say it, it hurts her to know that despite all her good points and all the fun you two have, you donât think sheâs good enough to spend any real time with.Sure, itâs mostly her fault, because she doesnât have to give in to your needs --- she could play the hard-to-get-***** like the rest of them do, if she really wanted to. But you and she both know that she probably couldnât pull it off. Maybe sheâs too short, or a little overweight, or has a big birthmark on her forehead, or works at Taco Bell, or just really not that type. Whatever the reason somehow. Life has given her a lot of really great qualities but has left out the ones that men want (or think they want) in a woman. So she remains forever the funny friendâ¦ the steadfast companionâ¦ the secret loverâ¦ and you go on searching for your goddess who will somehow be everything you ever wanted in a woman.Youâll joke to her that she should be the best man at your wedding, and sheâll laugh and make a joke about a smelly rental tux.She doesnât captivate you with her beauty or open doors with her smile. Mainly she blends in with the crowd. Sheâs safe. She doesnât want to be the center of attention and turn the heads of everyone in the room. But she wants to turn someoneâs head. She wants to be special to someone too. We all do.She has feelings. She has a heart. In fact, she probably has a bigger and better heart than any woman youâve ever known because sheâs had a front row seat to ""The Mess That Is Your Life"", and she likes you anyway. She obviously sees something worthwhile and redeeming in you because although youâve given her nothing, absolutely no reason to still be around, she isâ¦",female,16,Student,Scorpio,1
269331,3754226,2004-08-03,"When someone breaks your heart, you stop believing and you switch off the lights inside your heart. Someone is home but that someone is lying in the dark, in the room farthest from the gate, and that someone can't hear anything. Friends, family, they call out to her from the gate ("" Come out"" which means ""Move on"") but they are unheard, unseen, unacknowledged. When someone breaks your heart, you turn into a small ball of self-pity. You lie in bed, in a ball. You hug your knees, keeping them close to your chest, like a fetus. Freud said its human instinct to go back to the womb where we can feel safe. But that's what happens when someone breaks your heart-they steal the very thing that makes you feel safe, whole, and intact.      So much for all those lines that speak about, quite of âunrequited loveâ, and the need to feel love and be lovedâ¦ the next statements youâll be able to read are all from the heart of a simple girl who was once captivated by the eyes of a person she mistook to be an angelâ¦ then the next morning she woke up, learned how to love, to get hurt, to stand up and be whole again.  What is the sound of my heart breaking?  It is the sound beneath the silenceâ¦ deafening silenceâ¦ that I want to run away just to get rid and get over not of that silence, but of the pain that keeps on maiming my heart whenever I see him smile and the reason is not me.  The sound of the angst I feel for myself, the sound of the voices inside me murmuring, âWhy canât I be like her? If she was me, will he ignore her like he does to me? If I were her, will he love me like he does to her?â I wonderâ¦ I wander in the midst of that dark sky in a sunny afternoon.  It is the sound of the million âOuch! Aray! Awww!âs that keeps on running through my deepest veins. The sound of the breeze of the wind I wanted to catch and grasp in my hand, just as much as I want to hug him tight, so that I will never ever lose himâ¦ which I was never able to do in these 3 long years I have known him and is still, becoming a part of my chapterâ¦  The sound of the love calculator I just checked out for our compatibility, only to find out weâre only 22% compatible, while they are 78%... donât you feel the same feeling of the sound of a thousand miles I wanted to run for me to catch up with 56% more? Nakakahingal yun ah! But then I thought to myself, âBakit hindi? Sa pag-ibig, walang nakakapagodâ¦ walang nakakahingalâ¦ walang nakakauhawâ¦ walang nakakagutomâ¦ pag-ibig ehâ.  It is the sound of a pen striking in a notepad, unstoppable, like I foresee this love of mineâ¦ how it grows at a stronger and uncountable rate each and everyday I thank God I found someone like himâ¦ who inspires me to do my bestâ¦ and to be the greatest pain, the greatest joy, and greatest reason why I am writing this junk stuff. But I stopped for a while and thinkâ¦ if this will be foreverâ¦ isnât that too much to take? Wonât I ever break? I hope notâ¦ I guess notâ¦ why would he if he makes me completeâ¦ despite the fact the he empties the preemptied?  It is the sound of âmessage sending failedâ in my cell phone. I want to txt him, I really want toâ¦ and I failed even though I havenât tried. Thatâs more frustrating, donât you think?  It is the sound of his laughter whenever he gets to talk to her, but a thousand echoes of the broken arrows of cherubim who try to shoot his heart and so he wonât take his eyes off me.  It is the sound of the cracks and grinds of my heart sprinkled with nuisance injected in meâ¦ I wonder if I havenât been immune by this. It happened before, so many times before.  Why am I writing this? I donât know either. There are so many things we think we know, but the truth is, we donât have any idea about it. That is, when weâre in love. Lucky are those who feel the greatest thing weâll ever knowâ¦ to love and be loved in return; one-sided love, lucky too, of course! Because itâs better to have loved and lost than to never love at allâ¦ since the day I learned to breathe, I LIVE TO LOVE.     The experience of love is an inner state. When this is present, you are happy, alive and free. You feel good about yourself and good about life. As you bring the experience of love into your life, life works effortlessly and great things happen.  The opposite of love is fear and upset. When this is present, you close down inside. You lose your creativity and your ability to see clearly. You get tunnel vision and you interact in a way that almost always makes your situation worse.  Whether you live in a state of love or a state of upset depends, not on your circumstances, but on how your relate to your circumstances. A good way to see this is to look at upsets.  Upsets seem to be caused by what happens but they're not. Upsets are caused by your fighting and resisting what happens. To see this in your life, select a recent upset. Now notice what would happen if somehow you were at peace with what happened. There would be no upset.  There would be no upset because upsets aren't caused by what happened. Upsets are caused by fighting and resisting what happened. The moment you take away the fighting and resisting, the upset disappears.  To live in the experience of love, and to create a life that works, you need to stop the fighting and resisting. You do this through a process called ""letting go.""  Letting go is the inner action that releases the fear and upset. The moment you let go, everything seems to change. With the fear and upset gone, you see your situation very differently. You become creative and discover solutions that you could never have seen before.  To let go, you need to do the opposite of fighting and resisting. You need to let go of your demands and expectations for how life should be and make peace with the way life is.  Find what you are resisting. Then give it full permission to be there. If you have a fear of losing a relationship, be willing to lose it. If you are resisting the way someone is, give the person full permission to be that way.  Be willing for anything. Set yourself free inside. Then take whatever action you need to have your life be great.  Keep in mind that letting go is a state of mind and has nothing to do with your actions. Letting go is the process that removes the fear and upset so you can see what action you need to take.  In your heart, you can be willing to lose someone, but in your actions, do everything you can to make sure the person feels so loved that he or she would never want to leave.  To make letting go a little easier, there are several steps you can take. The first is trusting. Trust that no matter what happens, you will be okay. When you know that you will be okay, letting go becomes relatively easy.  Trusting is also telling the truth. You really will be okay no matter what happens. Life is only threatening when you resist. So stop resisting and trust. Trust that no matter what happens, you will be okay.  The second step in the process of letting go is to be willing to feel your hurt. Be willing to feel all the hurt and the feelings of being not okay that your circumstances reactivate. Be willing to feel the hurt of being worthless or not good enough.  The avoidance of this hurt is what makes you resist. Once you are willing to feel this hurt, the need to resist disappears. You can then let go.  For example, Robert had a fear of losing his wife Jan. To make sure she didn't leave, he hung on to her. His hanging on then pushed her further and further away. Robert was afraid of losing Jan because if she left him, this would reactivate all his hurt of feeling not worth loving. To avoid this hurt. He hung on.  Once he was willing to feel his hurt, the loss of Jan ceased to be a treat. He no longer needed to hang on and became willing for her to leave. The moment this happened he changed the way he related to her. Instead of needing Jan, he started treasuring her. Jan then felt so loved and able to be herself, she didn't want to leave.  This is what happens in life. The more you are able to let go and flow with life, the more life takes care of itself. You may not always get what you want, but you can always be free inside. You can restore both your peace of mind and your effectiveness. You can create a life that works.",female,16,Student,Scorpio,1
269332,3754226,2004-08-03,"Love can't do anything for you.  Love, if we're going to be honest, is what you do for others.                    Love may change your life, but it also can ruin it.  Real love won't change you, though.    Biblically, love can overcome anything. I mean here anything. I guess this means that I have to believe in it. But then, I've never experienced true love. It would be hard to believe that some people as what they have felt of known, they have known love. Not in my parents, not in boyfriends, not in friends - not through or from anyone. Because love, contrary to what we all expect, is not perfect. Love is nothing fancy. In the purest form, it's you down on your knees serving another. Love can't make anyone into anything they're not. And if you're honest with yourself, you don't love someone and want them to change, you love them for who they are right then and there, or you've never actually loved them at all, you only loved yourself. Romantic love doesn't mean you'll get to be with that person you love or you get to cuddle with that special someone for a day just to prove that it is love. So maybe you were told love can conquer all. It can, but real love does not seek its own. Some things it will not set out in conquest after, I've seen what love can do and what it can't do; but this I know... REAL love never fails. It's always there, regardless of what happens. It's not circumstantial. The moment it is, it's no longer love. That's what love is to me.",female,16,Student,Scorpio,1

Thank you Jenavive.  :)  That's one of the wonderful things about the online world, I am able to find those who agree with me.   Jenni said, ""My last baby REFUSED to take the breast. I tried. I called everyone and every nurse I could think of and he would not do it. He was preemie and I don't think his suck was strong enough. After a week I gave him a bottle. He did fine. My first baby I pumped for a month and he passed away before we could use it, he was very preemie. I donated the milk to the other babies. My middle one would have stayed on the breast for a life time but I couldn't keep up with the demand. I know breast is the best but sometimes you just can't.""    I guess I forgot to say that sometimes there are problems and you have to make a choice.  IMO though, your preemie NEEDED breastmilk even more than a full-term baby.  Mothers of preemies have breastmilk of a different composition, made especially for their babies.  Did you attempt to pump so that your baby could be fed your breastmilk via tube or syringe or even bottle?  I am so sorry that your first baby died, I can only imagine how terrible it was (and I have known loss as my infant brother died of brain cancer complications when I was 9 years old) to loss your son.  You said your middle son would stayed on the breast forever but you couldn't keep up.  Well, breastmilk is supply and demand so restricting nursing will restrict your supply.  Perhaps I'm misunderstanding you... did you mean he nursed too much for you?   GlycoFamily said, ""You go girl! I think we bought our soapbox from the same dealer :)  My sis has a baby who has been in NICU for over 2 weeks. Praise the Lord he goes home tomorrow but my sis was told not to breastfeed (and that includes pumping) because her milk is growing organisms or some crazy mess like that. UGh! I offerred to pump (and already have) for him but my sis said, ""Nah, that's OK. If formula is OK with the neonatologists then it's OK with me.""  BIG SIGH.........  Hope to read you often :)""    I find that horrifying.  Despite medical evidence (and evidence of preemies and babies everywhere), some doctors choose to ignore how vital breastmilk can be for babies.  If we deny a baby breastmilk, we can never know their full potentional.  How can you say, I fed formula and it didn't hurt him?  Your baby misses out on vital brain food that formula just can't provide.  Why would you CHOOSE to deny your baby?      Erin said, ""Well, I would go one step further and say the formula on the market today is junk food. It would be better to make your own from whole food sources. Check out the book Nourishing Traditions for more info. But of course, human milk for human babies... it is so sad women are given poor information/support, and have to suffer through bottle feeding.""    I agree Erin, to a certain extent.  I think formula is gross, but I suppose I am glad it's there for the babies who actually NEED it.  However, before I would give formula I would first choose my pumped milk and if that was unavailable I would use donated milk from friends (or others if I could afford a pastuerizer like Jenn at http://www.feedmybaby.com ).  Then and only then would I give formula.  I wouldn't starve my baby, but I wouldn't choose to feed my baby something that is made for a cow and has to be diluted and then fortified.  BTW, they fortify formula with the cheapest iron available, hence many babies don't even absorb what they need. More comments coming soon.  :)",female,23,Non-Profit,Capricorn,1

295648,3389579,2004-05-26,"I have come to the conclusion that War absolutely sucks!  I remember when we went to war originally back in March of 2003.  My friend Tim Stewart was ready to go the instant there was even a hint of war.  I wonder why that was.  Now he's been there for 3 months, and he says he is having a good time.  How can you have a good time amongst death and destruction.  It was pretty cool when he told me that he is getting to see a lot of places that are mentioned in the Bible.  If that is what he's referring to when he says he's having a good time, than I understand.  I want Tim to come home, but that won't happen for 9 more months.    Since we've been in California, Justin and I have become very close to another military man.  His story is different than Tim's, in the fact that he absolutely hates being in the military.  He doesn't hate the military, persay, but he sees it as a job and nothing else.  He got shoved into the war when he had barely turned 18.  He joined the Marine Corps at the age of 17, because his parents wanted him to clean up his act, and then he got sent to Iraq and was a part of the original destruction of that country.  We don't ask him about it, because it tears him up, but we know he had to kill lots of people.  Now that he's been home for a while, he is going to be sent back.  I don't want him to go.  He has become a good friend to Justin and I, and it just reminds me that war tears friends/families apart.    I don't really know where I'm going with this post, but I think I just wanted to get it across to everyone that I hate war!  I am not against President Bush, but I do hate the fact that we had to go to war.",female,23,BusinessServices,Gemini,1
295649,3389579,2004-05-25,"Yesterday, May 24, was my 1st wedding anniversary.  It was a very cool day, but it's sparked some interesting thoughts for me.  Q#1) Am I really old enough to be married?  A#1) Yes, I guess.  Q#2) Am I really mature enough to be married?  A#2) It depends on who you talk to.  Q#3) Do I know how to be a Godly wife?  A#3) I can only hope and pray.  And the list goes on.  Justin has assured me that most of these things are very true, and that I need not worry.  But I know I will still doubt myself from time to time.  The attribute that I want to strive the hardest for is being a Godly wife.  It means more to me than I ever thought it would, because Justin deserves the best.  He deserves to have a wife who seeks God's will, and will constantly strive to/be do anything he needs.  I want to be his confidant, I want to be his helper, I want to be his sounding board for sermons and lessons, I want to be his friend, I want to be the bride that Christ compares His church to.  Man, I definitely have a lot to live up to.    When I got home from work, Justin took me to my new favorite Japanese restaurant, Benihana.  I already had a love for Japanese food (cooked, not that raw crap), but this place just makes the food even better.  We had fun watching the chef chop things up, bang on the grill, do a little show to impress us.  I've always thought it was funny how the Japanese restaurants rely on their chefs to entertain the customers.  Anyways...it was great food, great service, and it was my anniversary!   Then he took me down to Santa Monica to walk down the Third Street Promenade, which is this really cool outdoor mall.  This place is cool, because you get to see no-name people (who are just praying that some big recording company executive will walk by and hear their self-written ballads) about every 50 feet singing and putting on their own little mini-concert to the passers-by.  You also can do any kind of shopping you want, because there are clothing stores, restaurants, an Apple store(which we unfortunately had to stop in), shoe stores, basically a mall.  Then we were going to go down to the beach, but the walkway was forever away and it was already 9:45 (we still had 30 minutes to drive home), and anyone who knows me well, knows that I'm not truly coherent past the time of 10:00pm.  So we just stood and watched the ocean from up on the pedestrian's sidewalk for a little while.  It was very romantic.    So, after this first year with my husband, I can truly say, that this has been the greatest year of my life.  I have grown, and I have been stretched beyond what I thought was possible, but it has been great!  Living with alone with a guy is hard work, especially for someone as detail-oriented, neat-freakish, and picky as I am.  I know that I shouldn't try to ""train"" Justin to be the person I want, but I do hope he'll learn to pick up some of my more anal habits, so that I don't have to work as hard at home anymore.    There is one thing I know for sure...I love Justin with all my heart.  You forever have my heart, Buddy!",female,23,BusinessServices,Gemini,1
295650,3389579,2004-05-21,"I just had lunch with one of the nicest people I've met since I've been here in California.  He works with me at the Hilton, and is the only person that consistently goes out of his way to say hi to me.  There's just one thing that makes me a little uncomfortable being around him.  He's very flamboyantly(sp?) gay.  I've never really met anyone who was gay, so Cesar's friendship is very different for me.     For the first month I worked here, he didn't know that I was a Christian, or that my husband was a pastor.  When he found out, he got angry with me, because the only Christians he's known, have turned their backs on him and said he was ""dirty.""  I had to explain to him that I would NEVER turn my back on him just because he chose this lifestyle.  I said I didn't agree with the way he lived, but I would never judge him because of it.  It took some convincing, but he finally came around to the fact that I wasn't going to drop him as a friend.    Now, my main goal is to show him love.  Justin is trying to help too, by coming in and talking to Cesar when he can.  Cesar's not quite sure what to think of Justin yet, but he's liking him more and more (in the purely platonic sense).  Today we were supposed to have lunch at work together, because he said he needed to talk to me about something.  I was so excited, because I thought maybe I would be able to talk to him about Christ.  Instead, our general manager ate with us, so we couldn't really talk.  I was a little bummed, because I was really hoping he would just ask me what I believe, and why.    We have talked about the Passion movie, but it didn't really affect him.  He just said it was not news to him that Jesus died in that way, and he was shocked that people would take it personal.  I explained that for myself, it was a reminder that I am the reason Christ was up on that Cross.  Even though I wasn't born till many years later, I had a direct hand in causing Jesus to be brutally beaten and killed up on the cross.  Cesar just looked at me and said, well, I guess.    How do I talk to him?  I find it very difficult to just come out and talk to him about stuff, unless he asks me.  Am I truly making a difference in his life?  I don't know...maybe I just provide a good source of entertainment.  Am I pleasing God by just being his friend, and not rebuking him because of his lifestyle?  It's a question that will always be in the back of my head.  Does any of this make sense?",female,23,BusinessServices,Gemini,1

295652,3389579,2004-05-19,"Today has been good.  I didn't have to wear my daily suit to work, which was nice.  Instead, I got to wear a Hawaiian shirt and casual skirt.  I am the Sales Coordinator here at the Hilton Garden Inn Valencia Six Flags, and today myself and my boss threw a Hawaiian themed party for our corporate clients.  It went well, and made the day go by very fast!  That was the nice part.    Then I came back to my office to see what kind of messages I got while I was at the party.  My mom had emailed me to let me know the tragedy that happened in my hometown.  Apparantly, some kids had gone out partying this past weekend.  On their way home, the driver rolled the car and was killed instantly.  Two of the kids had only minor injuries, and the other kid was put in the ICU unit at the hospital.  During the funeral for the driver, the school got word that the kid in the ICU had finally died as well.  They've been having prayer services almost every night since then, and they're even thinking about canceling the high school finals, because 2 of the kids were still in high school and the other 2 had graduated last year.  I feel awful, mainly because I know one of the kids pretty well (thankfully, he only had minor injuries), but at the same time, I almost feel that maybe this will teach my hometown a lesson.  IT IS NOT OK TO LET YOUR UNDERAGE CHILDREN DRINK.  There is a tradition in Heyworth, IL, that goes something like this:  As long as I (the parent) am in the house, and my child's friends leave their keys on the upstairs table, it is okay for them to drink down in the basement.  I went to a few such parties when I was back in high school, but I was known as a designated driver.  It is a sad day, when 2 of our underage children drink and die, and a sad week after, when all the parents are grateful that their own child is not dead.  I blame the parents first, the kids second, and our society third.  The parent's receive blame first of all, because they are teaching that it's okay to drink when they're underage.  First they do it with their parents, then they don't think there will be any consequences if they do it out in the country with just their friends.  Where is the concern and love for their kids?  I blame the kids second, because they're always going to push the envelope when it comes to their kids.  It's the feeling of, ""What can I do next?""  And I blame our society third, because no one ever steps out and shows their disapproval of underage drinking.    It is not up to me to judge, because there is One who is the ultimate judge.  This blog is merely my frustration.  I don't think people realize that their actions will ALWAYS affect other people.",female,23,BusinessServices,Gemini,1
295653,3389579,2004-05-19,"Well, I had a little free time at work today, so I thought I'd finally create a blog, so Lucas would stop hounding me about it.  So, here it is...I can't promise that there will be daily entries, but I'll do my best.  OK, I've read most people's blogs on graduation...(at least the blogs that I faithfully read).  I would have to agree with almost all of you.  I have definitely outgrown Lincoln, and all her glory.  I'm not trying to put myself up on a pedastal, but for some reason, I did not feel at home there, when I was back on Saturday.  There were so many things that I thought I would feel happy to see, but when I actually saw them, all I could feel was disorientation.  I just didn't feel comfortable being back in the LCC bubble.  It was good to see people.  I truly miss certain people.  Then there are those people that I am merely an acquaintance with, and it was a mutual feeling of ""eehh.""  I don't know how to put my feelings into words, because the feelings haven't quite unwound in my own head.    I think part of the reason I can't quite understand how I felt about the trip was because Justin did NOT want to go.  He is fed up with LCC, mainly because they keep messing up graduations for us.  Last year, they messed up my graduation, and this year Alan Kline told him he couldn't graduate because his online class with University of Texas hadn't gotten his grade to LCC.  He's done with the class, and anyone who knows him, knows that he probably aced the class, but yet he couldn't graduate.  Of course, he wasn't told he couldn't graduate until after we had purchased our airline tickets for over $300.00.  Alan Kline is a great registrar, I'm sure, but he needs to show a little grace, or at least a little remorse, when he gives bad news.    All in all, the two hours spent in Lincoln, and the 2 1/2 days spent in Illinois were good.  I didn't get to see my family like I wanted, but it was a good trip.  I am happy to be home in California, because the weather is awesome, I had GREAT friends to pick us up from the airport, and Justin was much happier to be home.",female,23,BusinessServices,Gemini,1
295654,3389579,2004-06-30,"Justin and I are moving on July 15.  I am counting down the days till we get to move!  Today we have 15 days to go.  It is 15 days too many, though.  We live in a nice apartment, don't get me wrong.  But, it is not exactly in the nicest area, it is 20 minutes away from everything we do and all our friends.  This new apartment is bigger (though, still only a one bedroom), nicer, in a nicer area, has a full washer/dryer, a big bathtub!, and the list goes on.  There are so many positives to this new place, that the positives of the one we live in now are almost non-existant.    The only problem is, by moving, our rent will go up almost $200.  But, since we both have full-time jobs, that doesn't phase us anymore.  The difference between rentals in Illinois and California initially shocked me, but they don't anymore.  I most of the time forget that, in Lincoln, we paid less than half of what we're paying now for an apartment twice the size of this one.  I think I tried to forget that one so that it didn't bum me out anymore.  I have finally come to the realization that Justin and I are going to make it as adults.  We are responsible for each other, and our parents have no more obligations to be our sources of being.    Growing up is a wonderful, but hard thing to do.",female,23,BusinessServices,Gemini,1
295655,3389579,2004-06-29,"All married couples should try to go on as many dates as possible.  Even when there are kids.  Justin and I try to go on a date every Monday night.  Last night was one of those nights.  We went to this real cool miniature golf course that is made with real grass.  Justin was so excited because he was going golfing today, and it was going to be good practice for him.  Plus, this is first real greens course that he's seen.  It was funny to see him so excited to play mini golf.    To get to the point, we bet each other on who would win.  If I won, he had to take me to get frozen yogurt (which he does not like).  And if he won, I had to take him to get Jamba Juice (which I like, but didn't want last night).  It was really close on the back 9.  I was doing real well, and even got a hole-in-one!  I think I even shot par.  But, anyways, He added it all up, and he beat me by one stroke.  Dagnabit!  So close, but yet I still had to get him Jamba Juice.  So, remember, once married, dates are a good thing.  It's even okay to make competitions out of your dates, because you're not trying to impress each other as much anymore by letting the girl win.  Competitions keep fun in the marriage, if you know what I mean!",female,23,BusinessServices,Gemini,1
295656,3389579,2004-06-25,"I walked into work today in a pretty good mood.  I sat down and started to check my email, when I saw an email entitled ""Jim Strange,"" from my mom.  That scared me, because that's my uncle's name and I knew something probably happened to him, otherwise she wouldn't have titled her email like that.  So I opened it, and read this,    ""The details are lengthy, but would you all pray for and put Jimmy on your church prayer lists, please?  He was the engineer on the northbound Amtrak involved in a gruesome suicide train accident south of Champaign at Savoy last night.  Sam talked with him late last night by cell.  Jim was being sent back to Carbondale on a southbound Amtrak.  Right now, Jimmy is in shock.  Please keep him in your prayers.  Love, Chris/mom.""    That scared me to death, so I called my mom immediately to see what had happened.   Apparantly, my uncle was the engineer last night on a northbound train to Chicago.  Right before he hit Champaign, he noticed a man standing on the tracks.  So, he naturally pulled the horn and the brake at the same time.  He said that he made eye contact with the man, and then the man turned his back to the train and committed suicide.    It took Uncle Jim 500 feet before the train actually stopped from when he first pulled on the brake, because he was going 79 miles/hour.  My uncle is in shock, because in his thinking, he just killed a man.  He knows that it wasn't his fault, but there's still that feeling of guilt.    I've been sitting here at work thinking about this off and on all day.  I called my mom, and discussed this with her a little bit, and she told me her feelings.  She's angry.  I SECOND HER ANGER.  Suicide is such a hard thing to deal with for families, in the first place.  But when you decide that suicide is the only option left for your life and then you decide to make someone else half responsible for it, that's just plain selfishness.  This guy probably didn't even think about the fact that he was going to involve someone else in this suicide attempt.  Someone who he didn't even know.  Maybe if he did think about that, he figured that since my uncle didn't know him, it wouldn't be that bad.  WELL, HE WAS DEAD WRONG!  Figuratively and Literally.  I feel sorry for the family as well, because they are left with all the issues that this guy felt were too overwhelming to deal with.  I know that I will calm down in a couple days, but right now, all I feel is pain for my uncle.  He was put in one of the most difficult situations that I could only imagine being in.  Please, help me Lord, to forgive this man.  I'm sorry, Uncle Jim, that this man dragged you into his unsatisfied life.  I will pray for you, that you will come to a peace about this situation.  I will also pray that your life will go back to normal soon.  I love you!",female,23,BusinessServices,Gemini,1

No angel food cake with sticky icing from Grandma Norma.  No call from the Kascel's with the Happy Birthday song to both myself and Dad.

I used to not like Jr. Highers, but since we've been out here, I've learned to love them dearly.    Now I have a hard time dealing with High Schoolers.  Especially High School girls.  I don't know what it is out here, but girls are idiots, and the stereotype ""Valley Girl"" is not just something that is in books or movies.  It's real.  There really are girls like that in this state.  Especially here.  The term ""Valley Girl"" is usually used for a girl from the San Fernando Valley.  They really do say ""like"" every other word.  They really are really dumb.  And they really do dress very slutty.    But anyways, my point of this blog is not about how I don't really like High School girls, but it is about my day on Sunday.  I was a sponsor who got to take some High Schoolers to Knott's Berry Farm (which is this semi-cool amusement park next to Disneyland).  I was dreading it, and actually thought I had gotten out of it.  But to my dismay, the other female High School leader backed out and they had to call me to go.  I just didn't want to go, but I was praying the whole time that God would help me to have fun.  As it turned out, Kelsey, one of the girls that I thought I couldn't stand was one of the few girls going.  So I was even more put-out because I didn't want to deal with her.    The irony is, I had a GREAT time.  I just put aside my own desires, and let God lead me to be a fun leader for the day.  We had a blast, and I really got to like all the girls that went.  Even Kelsey.  I actually got to know her a little bit more, and she's a pretty cool girl.  I'm sorry that I put an initial ""dislike"" label on her.  I wish I could tell her that, but then I'd have to admit to her that I didn't like her at first.    I just want to say that God shows me new avenues every day to go down.

Jeremy's wife's birthday is 8 days before his.    May:   My mom's birthday is at the end of May, just 3 days before my wedding anniversary, and 2 weeks after Mother's Day.  My niece has a birthday at the beginning of May.  June:   My 23rd birthday is next week.  My dad also shares that day as his birthday.  And so does my great-uncle (who is not with us anymore).  And mine and my dad's birthday always falls on or very close to Father's day. My brother-in-law and sister-in-law have their wedding anniversary today!  My Father-In-Law's birthday is 5 days before mine.  And my parents-in-law have their anniversary 3 days after my birthday.    July:   My brothers got married 2 weeks apart in July, so their anniversaries are very close together.    We'll skip a few months here.   October:   My nephews share the same birthday, mainly because they're twins.  My Grandpa's birthday is at the end of the month.  November:   Justin's birthday is usually on or right before or after Thanksgiving.  December:   My mom and Dad's anniversary is a few days after Christmas.  It's this thing my family does...we celebrate everyone's birthdays or anniversaries or holidays with one big party a month.  We make sure, though, to recognize each individual birthday or anniversary or holiday.

I might be biased, but she is by far the cutest little 2-year-old I know.  She is absolutely beautiful, and way smart!  She's memorized her bedtime story, to the point where her mom, Katie, says 3 words in a row and Abbie finishes the sentences.  What 2-year-old can do that?  Man, she's smart!    Last night we got on our webcam and talked to her.  I have this nickname that I call her, and I'm the only one who calls her that.  So, last night, Jason and Katie (my brother-in-law/sister-in-law) were prompting her by asking her what does your Aunt Hillary say to you?  She answered correctly...""Hi Love!""  That's my nickname for her, ""Love.""  It was so funny, because she kept getting real close to the camera.  Maybe she thought that we were in the camera, but I don't think so.  She's so smart!  She knows we live in California and the only way to get here is by plane.  I wish they would all get on a plane to come out here!    I think the only point I'm trying to make is that I miss her (and all of my family) and I'm glad she didn't forget me.

295662,3389579,2004-06-08,"Well, my mom is quirky!  I've had good times and lots of great times with her, and I've had bad times with her.  I love her with all my heart, but when I was younger, I always swore I'd never be like her.  Isn't that what all kids say?  It's because when we're kids, we didn't know what was best, as much as we'd like to think we did.  Unfortunately, she did.  She always knew what was best.  She did have my best interests at heart.    Unbeknownst to me, I grew up exactly like her.  I'm neat and clean.  I say quirky things A LOT!  I like to be in charge.  I am a faithful wife (though, in my case, it's only been for a year and for her, it's been 33 years).  I like things done a certain way, and if they're not, I'll change it later.  I like to read.  I like the quiet.  I look a lot like her.  I even find her humor funny when noone else does.  And the list goes on and on.  I don't exactly find these qualities to be bad, but the more they get pointed out to me, the more scared I get.  Not really scared because I don't want them, but scared because I am turning out to be exactly like her.  Justin is always telling me to stop picking on him about cleaning up after himself.  I think I do it because I grew up with the idea that everyone is to fend for yourself, but make sure it's done neatly.  He laughs at me all the time because I have to have the bed made a certain way, and the towels folded just right.  Those are all things my mom instilled in me a long time ago, and I guess I just forgot that it was her that made me do it this way when I was a kid.  Of course I do have a lot of different qualities that she doesn't have, just like she has qualities that I could only wish for.  I just think it's weird how God creates us.  I bet He's laughing right now as I'm writing this blog because I'm shocked to find out about this phenomenon.  I hope you're having fun, God, because I'm gonna take this issue up with you when I meet you someday, hehehe!  Am I weird, or what?",female,23,BusinessServices,Gemini,1
295663,3389579,2004-06-04,"The one thing I have tried to do since I got out here to California and started working, was portray Christ in my life.  I long to have someone ask me why I don't get upset at some things, or why I don't drink alcohol all the time, or why I am nice to everyone.  Every once in a while do I get someone who will actually ask me about myself and Justin.  I then tell them that Justin is a pastor, and that sparks about a 5 minute conversation.  I hope someday that conversation will be longer.  But working in a non-Christian environment is totally different/harder than I thought.   So...from that, I get this next emotion!  I'm going to kill Alina.  Alina is my manager.  I work directly with her day in and day out.  She is a very cool and intelligent person.  She's from Romania, but speaks 5 different languages, not including uding Romanian.  From what I can tell, things are done differently in her country.  She says all the time how nobody in this country does anything efficiently.  Well, she and I both know that's not totally true, but a majority of our country does just loaf around to the point of major frustration.  Anyway...sometimes she just pushes my buttons, because she's so abrupt.  She continuously gives me things that need to be done in a fashionable manner, but how can I get them done when 5 minutes later she gives me another thing that needs to be done ASAP?  A lot of the time, the things she's giving me are things that she has more time to do and just doesn't want to because it's ""easier"" for me to do it.  And then when things go wrong for her (even if I had nothing to do with it) she yells at everyone.  She does apologize from time to time for being a jerk to me when she is mad at other people.    I am always trying to portray myself in such a way that she will notice I'm different from everyone else.  How can I portray a Christian attitude when she keeps testing my spirit!  I just don't know how to act like it doesn't bother me when she expects/demands me to do things right at that moment and I have a lot of things on my plate.  There is not one bone of patience in her body some times.  How in the world do I portray the image of Christ, when all I want to do is yell at her?  And so goes the saga of working in a non-Christian environment...",female,23,BusinessServices,Gemini,1
295664,3389579,2004-06-03,"Well, a lot has happened since last week.  It seems like it was a long time ago, but yet it was only 7 days.  Who knows...time sure does fly, but sometimes it seems like it's walking very slowly.    Memorial weekend was a good one for me.  Friday I got to take a half day, and saw ""The Day After Tomorrow.""  It was OK.  It was a good movie, but there were some things that I really questioned.    Saturday, I went shopping and had lunch with my good friend, Angel.  We had our last Saturday night service at Real Life Church!!!!  I am so happy about this one, because now I get to have a husband on Saturdays!  (Someday I'll write about our awesome church, and let you all know what we're up to!)  But anyways, our leadership chose to get rid of our Saturday night service, and add one more, making that 3 services on Sunday mornings.    Sunday, Justin and I went to San Diego with our friends Dan and Angel after church.  We got 2 hotel rooms (one for the girls, one for the boys) at the Hilton.  Sunday was just great, because we got to talk a lot, and we went down to the beach so Justin and Dan could do a little night surfing.  It was very nice!  Then we went to Benihana, thanks to Grandma Dottie (who is this older lady who has taken the four of us in and takes us to dinner all the time), and enjoyed the funny chef.    Monday, ah, Monday...what a day it was!  We got up and went to one of Camp Pendleton's beaches (Camp Pendleton is a Marine/Navy Base), since they are private and Dan (a Marine) got us on.  He wanted to take us there because there wouldn't be a lot of people out, and he and Justin were going to teach us ladies how to surf.  Well, Angel didn't want to, but I did...so I did!  It was hard, but it's really fun.  I did get up 3 times, and so I feel very proud of myself.  I will become good at it eventually, but I will need to practice a lot before that time.  The only downfall to Monday was the fact that I got VERY sunburned.  I got burned so bad, that I had to call in sick on Tuesday because I had a fever from the sunburn.  Oh well...I learned how to surf!  It was awesome!  Since then, it's been just mundane days.  Nothing real special to write about.",female,23,BusinessServices,Gemini,1
295665,3389579,2004-07-30,"So, Justin got hurt on Tuesday night playing softball.  It was actually a pretty scary night, because Justin doesn't get hurt easily and he has a very high threshhold for pain.  This is how it went down.  He was in centerfield, trying to catch a fly ball.  It was going deeper than he was, so he turned to run after it.  About his 3rd step out, he said he felt/heard his hamstring ""pop.""  He fell down and then got up.  At first he said he didn't think it was that bad, so he hobbled to switch places with their catcher, and I met him at home plate.  From behind the fence, I could see him sweating really bad, and his breathing was really labored.  I knew from that, he was in a lot of pain.  So I asked him if he wanted me to take him to the hospital.  Right at that moment, the next batter came up and commented on how he didn't look so good.  He lost all sense of balance and started to fall.  At that point he realized he needed to sit down and I yelled to have someone help him to the dug-out.  The sweating got worse, and all the sudden his eyes started rolling back into his head.  The guys hollared for me to go get my car and take him to the ER.  So I did, and as I was driving up, the guys that were helping him to the car shouted that he was completely gone.  He had fainted from the pain, and was having a hard time staying awake.  They started dumping water on him, to wake him up, and told me to hurry as fast as I could to the hospital.   So, long story short, the ER doctor was stupid and way too hasty.  He diagnosed Justin with a hamstring pull and gave him some weak-strengthed Vicaden.  That was Tuesday.  Yesterday, Justin told me that he needed to go to the doctor, because there was no bruising as of yet, and the pain had not subsided whatsoever.  So I took him to the doctor, and she confirmed what he had been thinking all along.  He had partially torn  his hamstring.  The bad thing is, the doctor said there was nothing he could do for it but wait for it to heal itself.  If it had been torn all the way, he would have had to go to surgery, but it's only torn partially, so there's nothing we can do.   I feel bad, but I'm trying to be the best in-home nurse possible.  He's bed-ridden, because it hurts him too bad to walk, so we are having a lot of down-time at home, which we probably needed.  If anyone has any ideas about how I can make him more comfortable, please let me know.  I'm open to most ideas, so give 'em to me!",female,23,BusinessServices,Gemini,1
295666,3389579,2004-07-21,"I'm on my own this week.  Justin went back to Illinois to preach at his home church and to do a wedding for a friend from high school.   I couldn't get off work, so I didn't get to go back with him.  I don't really like being home alone.  I actually have never liked it, but at this point, I realize there's nothing I can do about it.      So I have a week full of activities in my action plan.  I work till 5 every night, and then I am planning on going to the gym after after work every night.  Tonight, I have to go back to our old apartment before I can go to the gym.  I have to turn in our keys and I will be hopefully receiving our security deposit back.  Tomorrow night I will be doing a bunch of things, which include hopefully finishing putting everything away in my new apartment.  Friday night, I will be at work for a party that my department is throwing.  And then on Saturday, I am planning on being lazy till I pick Justin up from the airport.

295668,3389579,2004-07-13,"I've lived out here for 6 1/2 months, and I haven't seen any celebrities, other than 1 semi-popular soap star.  So, it's been pretty uneventful in that area.  Until last night!  Last night was Justin and I's weekly date night.  He surprised me by getting free tickets to the Mercedes Benz Cup, which is a tennis tournament.  Last night was the opening night, and the night when they do all sorts of fun things.  They invite celebrities to come and play with professionals, and they have singers and all kinds of stuff.    When we got there, we were looking for the table that had our tickets, and we happened to stumble across the celebrity entrance.  There, no more than 5 feet from us was Tom Green and Jillian Barberie.  She's actually a lot shorter than you'd think.  She's about the same heigth as me, maybe even a little shorter.  Then, when we got inside to the court, we learned that the celebrities playing were going to be Dr. Phil, Jon Lovitz, some soap star and the blond girl from 8 Simple Rules (the show that had John Ritter in it before he died).  Wilson Phillips was the opening act, and they were terrible.  They only sang 3 songs, and the only one that sounded any good at all was their hit from the early 90's.  I can't even remember what the name of it was.    So, it was a fun night.  We actually left before it was over, because it actually got boring towards the end of the night.  I was pretty chilly, too, so we took off early.  I was satisfied, though, because we got to see some celebrities finally.  It's cool, but the excitement only lasts for a few minutes.  Oh well.  I had fun.",female,23,BusinessServices,Gemini,1
295669,3389579,2004-07-02,"I never really thought I would have a lot of friends throughout the years that I could go to whenever I needed to, even if I hadn't seen them in a while.  I've recently been experiencing the fact that I do have those friends.  And it makes me feel really nice, because they are GREAT friends.  I really only have 3 ""best"" friends, not including Justin (who is the only person who knows absolutely EVERYTHING about me).  Here they are, in no particular order:  1) Jenni.  Jen and I have known each other since we were 1.  She is best friend in the whole world.  We've been close all of our lives.  It's one of those friendships where we don't need to be all ""clingy"" to each other, but we enjoy every minute of our time together.  When we're not together, we miss each other, but we don't dwell on it.  There are always certain things I can count on when it comes to Jen.  I can always count on getting a call from her and Jewels (her mom) on my birthday, simply so they can sing Happy Birthday.  I can always count on getting an awesome cherry-filled ""candy cane"" bread dish on Christmas Eve.  I can count on her never cutting her hair past her shoulders.  I can count on her to give me a shoulder to cry on, or an ear to listen to, and someone to laugh with.  Jen, you will always be my BBF and I LYLAS!  2) Lindy.  Lin and I have known each other since we were 18 and freshmen at LCC.  We grew closer and closer over the years, and finally in our last 2 years, we were the only ones of our ""group"" left.  So we became even closer.  I know I can always count on her to make me laugh.  To make me jealous because she's beautiful, she's intelligent, and always got cooler things than me.  I know that we will be close friends, even if we never live near each other again.  I love that she calls me for advice.  I usually don't have good answers, but I just feel privileged that she would think of me to ask.  I would always drop anything I'm doing just to talk to her!  3) Greg.  Greg is just one of the nicest people you could ever meet.  He's always willing to listen, to play cards, to just hang out!  He and I met my freshman year at Lincoln, and have been good friends ever since.  It wasn't until my Junior year that we got real close, and I could consider him a best friend.  That's what he still is, though.  I definitely made sure it was okay with Justin when I would want to talk to him on the phone.  When we were still in Lincoln, Greg and I had coffee meetings.  Before Justin and I were together, we would just go on a whim.  Once Justin was in the picture, he would sometimes join, but mostly he just gave me an ok to go with Greg to get coffee and talk.    My number one best friend will always be Justin.  That's one of the reasons why I married him.  I have always felt like I could tell him anything I did or felt or wanted to do, and he would never be judgmental.  He has always supported me in all I do, and I do the same for him.  God blessed me more than I thought was possible when he decided Justin and I would be together.  Thank you, Lord, for bringing Justin into my life, because I've never felt safer.  I have 2 sets of arms wrapped around me at all times...God's and Justin's.  He makes me feel special at all times.  He thinks of me before himself.  He loves me unconditionally.  He's HOT!  He's funny.  He's a great basketball player and golfer.  He's intelligent.  He's HOT!  Thank you, too, Lord, for the friends you've brought into my life.  I am a better person because of them.

Hummm... really now...  What I want to say is that I am getting too dependant on him and it's getting really unhealthy. Every night I would come back home and expect him to be with me. If there is something that went wrong, he would be the first person I run to, even on tiny little things. Whenever he is not around, I feel a little lost. Which is so scary.  Did I tell you I told him about how I feel towards him in an email and he went speechless? My thought would be he was not able to feel the same for me. Sometimes I don't really understand what is being withheld. I think it's because they are happy with where they are or they are expecting something better, which I believe the latter applies more. Which is a bit... sad, actually.  I always tell people I am desperate seeking.

300906,3992888,2004-08-16,"We got cell phones. That was our smallest purchase of the weekend at 1 yen (with a year long contract). Needless to say, they are pretty neat and will serve their purposes in case anything happens to us on the road in a foreign country where we don't know what to say in the middle of nowhere. (It's really not that scary.) By the way, moshi moshi means hello (I think only when you answer cell phones).  Friday after work, Cristina came over and picked me up. I drove in her car under her supervision to make sure that I would know how to drive manual on a mountain with curvy roads. It turns out I do, so I am not as frightened as I was beforehand. That night we went to Kanoya city, the nearby not so city-like or very pretty place, but it is more urban which is kinda nice. We went out with some other JET participants. It was about 8 of us in total. We found that many places were full because this weekend is Obon, a holiday when people go back home to visit their families and remember their ancestors. Finally we found a place and ate. It was all you can eat and drink but I wasnt really that hungry or in the mood to drink (especially after Tokyo -- haven't told you guys about that one). After we ate, we went to a Karaoke Bar. It was not the karaoke booths type of place.  It was actually like a lounge and you told the bar tender the song number and then when your song comes up you get passed a portable microphone.  I did not feel like singing too much although I did do backup vocals to I forget which song.  There were probably about 50 people there, and we probably monopolized the mics most of the night.  The bathroom there was very odd.  At first you open the door and you are in a dark closet that is wallpapered in a dark pattern.  If it weren't for the door knob to the actual bathroom you would think you were in this dark little closet.  Then when you go into the toilet room, there was this apparently famous poster of obscene and lude acts that 1 or 2 people can do in a bathroom stall.  We were at this bar till about 4 a.m. and proceeded to go home.  Two of our friends that were drinking were going to get this special kind of cab that comes with 2 drivers -- one drives the cab and the other drives your car.  (Isnt that neat, they should have this in the States.)  However, since Cristina and I were not drinking we just did it instead.  I felt really comfortable driving the manual car again.  We dropped them off in Kushira and continued to Cristina's house in Higashi-Kushira.  We woke up the next morning and I told Cristina that I felt as if I were hung over.  Because of all the smoke, lack of sleep and dehydration, I felt like I was run over by a truck.  In any case, we went to try to get a cell phone but I forgot my passport (I did not think I needed it, after I yelled at Cristina why did she bring hers, yada yada yada . . . . I'm sure she would enjoy if I went into further detail.)  We the proceeded to go to a cafe with Kaz and her boyfriend Alex who lives in Kagoshima City.  The cafe reminded me of any independent cafe back home -- kind of Top-ish or Satchel-ish (but with blue instead of Green or Yellow) for you Gainesville folk.  Then we went to the 100 yen store (aka dollar store) which is amazing!  Mom, you would go crazy.  They had so many things that we wanted to buy, things that you never even knew you wanted.   These arent like your dollar store back home.  Cristina went a little crazy and spent about 25 dollars, but it was stuff that really helped her place out.  I spent about 5 dollars on a change purse because you get so many coins in change; 1 cent through 5 dollars are coins.  It's not really a change purse but like a U shaped thing that you open and your change slides out.  You see a lot of these in Italy (not for 1 dollar).  I also bought some cool handkerchiefs and some rugs.  Later that night we went over to the Kato house for a big dinner.  It was so much food again and so much fun.   We went back to Cristina's and spent Sunday fixing up her house.  It looks really nice.  We rearranged the furniture and everything really makes sense and feels like it's hers.  Then, we went back to Kanoya and bought cell phones.  Last night Cristina drove me home but since it was kind of late she stayed over and drove to Higashi-Kushira this morning (the sun rises here at about 5 a.m.).  Tomorrow, we leave to Kagoshima City, the capital, to go to our orientation for 3 days.  I pick up Cristina tomorrow morning and head off to the port about 30 mins from Cristina's house to cross the bay to the other peninsula where the Capital is.  (Make sure to see a map of Kagoshima to understand, our prefecture are two side by sude peninsulas that are separated by a bay with a big active volcano in the middle.)  Then, its a short walk from the ferry terminal to our hotels.  The trip is a busuness trip so my passage and stay is paid for.  I even get a daily allowance for food.  I forget what the official word is for this.  Mom, or anyone, if you could remind me it would be great.  Well I believe that is it for now.  Do not be alarmed if I dont write for a few more days.  Oh, and Friday is my welcome party... WOOO HOOO.",male,23,Education,Gemini,0
300907,3992888,2004-08-13,"So boys and girls, I caught another one.  Minnie Mouse is gone but Speedy Gonzalez is still on the loose.  I went to the rice chest yesterday and placed the glue trap right beneath the drawer before I opened it but Speedy ran and managed not to touch the trap.  Therefore, when I did it again (Minnie was still in the rice chest) I placed the trap more carefully and I caught her by the corner of the trap when she tried to sun out.  I'll save you the gruesome details.  Luckily, today is the day to throw out your paper and other burnables like food and I think that the mouse and trap fell in that category.  I only hope that they don't return it. (I'll explain now.)  Garbage (or gomi) is all recycled or burned here; therefore, it could be somewhat difficult for a foreigner to get in the rhythm of throwing out certain trash on certain days not knowing what gets thrown out with what, when and where.  (It's even more difficult than it sounds, at least in the beginning.)  They have clear bags that are used for paper and other burnables like leftovers and dead mice.  They have green bags for clean plastic; this does not include plastic bottles, those are cleaned and put in a separate bag.  There is a red bag for cans and aluminum (they also must be cleaned before thrown away).  There is also trash bags for clean glass bottles, a day for throwing out furniture and appliances, and a day for throwing out wrapped newspapers and folded up milk and juice cartons.  All the days are rotated and color coded on a big 1 year poster calendar that goes in your kitchen (at least in mine) with a big matching poster index to classify different trash.  Apparently my predecessor had a lot of trouble with this and they would often return her trash for improper splitting methods.  How they were able to tell it was her trash neither I nor her know.  Cristina's predecessor often went to the grocery store and thought that something looked tasty but refused to buy it because he did not know where he would throw away the packaging.  I actually have one bag full of trash that my predecessor left that I do not know what I am going to do with.  Some other things I wanted to share with you.  During lunch time I walk around the port, beach and river to read and eat or just relax.  What I find amazing is that the river here is (now) very shallow and has what we call in the states koi swimming around.  So essentially it looks like a huge water garden.  For those of you who dont know what koi are, they are basically giant brightly colored goldfish.  You can see them feed from the sidewalk and bridge about 15 feet up.  Something funny that happens to me after I come back from lunch is that certain people always ask me what I ate with great curiosity.  They think it's so interesting to see what I do and don't eat.  Side note:  The japanese products that have english on them are so funny.  Yesterday I bought a pack of these chocolate dipped long very thin pretzels.  My predecessor had left me a box of them so I went to buy another box I liked it so much.  Well this time I got the same pack but it was green instead of red and the brand ""Pocky Chocolate"" was modified by ""Men's"". . . so it read ""Men's Pocky Chocolate"".  I found this so funny that I had to take a picture of it.  The only difference was that this was dark chocolate versus milk chocolate (I think . . . I hope).  Last night Cristina was invited to go with this Japanese woman and her two daughters that are Cristina's age.  They went to the ""art festival"" that was at a strip mall type thing but it did not have any art and it had ""popular Japanese food"" like cotton candy.  This was in Koyama, the town between us.  She also saw a fireworks display and enjoyed it very much.  For more details you will have to ask her because I wasn't there.  This afternoon, Cristina is picking me up and we are going to drive to her house together so I can practice.  Tonight we are going to Kanoya, a nearby city.  Well, I'll talk to you later.  I may not have computer access this weekend unless I go to Cristina's so don't be alarmed if I don't write for a few days.",male,23,Education,Gemini,0
300908,3992888,2004-08-12,"They're back.  Apparently Mickey had some friends.  I like to call them Donald and Minnie who are now together now that Mickey is out of the picture.  Last night as I was waiting to see Back to the Future Part II, I heard the scratching noise I had heard earlier when I thought it was Mickey.  Well, I went to take a look in this cabinet that had a built in rice dispenser thingy (I dont keep any rice in it) and the mice were in there.  I couldnt catch them yesterday so I simply put a fire extinguisher in the way so they cannot get out.  Hopefully I can have someone else try to catch them.  I just couldnt bare setting up the mouse trap and hearing them squeal in the middle of the night.  Guess what I just noticed . . . . somebody left a Mickey Mouse pencil on my desk.  That's pretty funny.  Anyway, didn't do anything too interesting yesterday.  I think I finally mastered hiragana and katakana (the two japanese alphabets).  Also, something weird was happening at work yesterday.  Everyone was very stressed out and frantically talking on the phone.  Then everyone was out for about half the day.  Cristina dined at her boss's house last night and said that she had a great time.  She said she ate some yummy tempura stuff and some great sushi.  Then she had some dessert, gold kiwi (which she liked so much that they gave her some to take home) and a wheat tea that was also very good.  Someone then called her at about 10 p.m. to invite her to Kaz's town of Koyama for the Matsuri and fireworks they are having their tonight.  I don't think I am going because I still don't feel comfortable driving without a cell phone.  This weekend Kaz invited us to meet her in the nearby city of Kanoya (one hour or less away) for some conveyor belt sushi.  For those of you who don't know what this is, it's when you sit at a bar and small plates of sushi come around on a conveyor belt.  Depending on the color of the plate is the price of the sushi.  Then at the end they just look at your number and color of plates and they add it all up.  Then on Saturday we may go to the beach or a coastal drive.  Hopefully Cristina will have her alien registration card by then so we can get cell phones.  Next week we are going to Kagoshima City (state capital) for prefectural orientation Tuesday thru Thursday (all expenses paid except food), but I'll save that story for tomorrow.  CK, you're comment cracked me up.  I miss you so much.  Everytime someone says  Su Goi  (and they say it a lot) I think of you and smile.  As a matter of fact, at the fireworks festival several young people kept saying  su ge  and I told everyone at my office that I thought it was so funny, so they started teaching me all these other slang words and Kagoshima-ben and Uchinoura-ben.  Keep the comments coming.  Email me too.  What's going on in Gainesville?",male,23,Education,Gemini,0
300909,3992888,2004-08-11,"Happy Birthday Mom and Raulito!  I wish you the best and wish I could be there.  No more Mickey.  He has left us.  Last night, Kaz, the ALT who lives in Koyama the town in between Cristina and I, met us in my house.  We spoke for a couple of hours and had a great time.  However, when she was about to leave I saw Mickey as I do every night out of the corner of my eye and we tracked him down to behind a small bookcase I have.  I kept an eye on him while Cristina and Kaz handed me the glue traps so that I could put one on either side.  Within seconds the mouse ran and foound itself glued to the trap.  They told me to close it after I caught it so I did but the mouse was still alive (we could hear it squeaking).  So Cristina hit it (understatment) while we made loud noises so she wouldn't hear the mouse.  It gets better because garbage is difficult to understand if you do not know japanese.  Apparently there are 5 different classifications of recyclables that go out on certain days.  Since I still dont know the system, Kaz volunteered to take it to a convenience store where garbage is only classified into burnables and non-burnables.  (We voted burnables.)  Some other interesting happenings yesterday . . . at 10 a.m. I had to introduce myself to town officials in Japanese.  It was fun.  For lunch I had a Gatorade, a fried sweet potato/pumpkin thingy and some fried dumplings.  I know I gorged myself, and the best part is that it was only 3 bucks.  I also got the opportunity of sending for my absentee ballot.   I urge you all to register to vote at this time if you have not already.   I also received my alien registration card which looks just like a driver's license with a goofy picture of me on it.  And, I opened up my bank account in the post office.  Yes, the post office.  I already have the equivalent of 10 cents in it.  As to answer some of Ashley's questions from her comment as I am sure that several of you (if anybody else is reading this) have the same questions. . . . my ""fast as an ostrich"" comment was alluding to Cristina's ridiculous comment (ostrich is the fastest animal on Eartth).  No I did not know how to drive stick shift before Cristina's dad taught me.  I have never had a reason to.  (So you got me on that, but I know how to drive it now.)  As for the car being different . . . it is.  Think of a mini coop or a civic hatch back half the size.  You drive on the opposite side of the road with the wheel on the opposite side AND everytime I get in the car my knees hit the steering wheel.  Add to that the fact that we are driving in the mountains, with ditches that work for gutters so that there are no land slides everytime it rains (the car can get stuck in these, they are deep) and the fact that the roads are narrow with sharp turns.  So it is a bit scary at times.   As for not catching the mouse . . . too late.  I actually thought the same thing, but I cant think that way anymore.  And I pray that there are not any mousey babies around.   I have not seen anybody  eat  anything crazy but I have seen crazy things at the grocery store.  Lots of weird seafood and bags of fish flakes.  The raddishes here are huge.  I also saw some green bread with some brown stuff on it that I want to try but havenet.  Oh actually, the other day with tea I had some omiyage someone brought from Osaka that everyone was skeptical about because it was a sweet made from octopus.  I was good though.  It looked like a ball of dough.  And NO, no one has died from a pucker fish yet as far as I'm aware.  Something neat that I forgot to tell you guys about . . . Yesterday after Cristina went home, Kaz went to go visit the Katos and they called me up.  Apparently they had a makeshift party outside their house.  They were hosting several people from Kanagawa (near South Tokyo) who were here working in the Space Center.  They were cooking outside and made some YakuSoba or SobaYaku, I cant remember.  It's grilled noodles with vegetables meat and seafood.  In my plate during one of my many servings (IT WAS SOOOOO GOOD), I was served this half of an Octopus (that would be 4 tentacles) which I could not bring myself to eat.  Maybe next time.  Well thats it for now.  Jane.",male,23,Education,Gemini,0

For one, I got a copy of the Kagoshima (the name of my state) english newsletter which has the listings of things happening around the state and (drum roll please) a listing of english language movies on TV. Yesterday was Poltergeist but I refused to watch it since I go to sleep with the TV on. I am paranoid enough as it is. My second piece of exciting news is that after work I went with a couple of guys from work to see a 7 meter rocket launched from the space center. It was pretty neat.  As for lunch yesterday, it was somewhat of a dud. It was 2 dollars. I had a teryaki burger. It was better than a chicken pattie but still a little odd, and I also had a bottled soy latte to drink. I did not really like these in Starbucks so I cant imagine why I tried it. I guess curiosity.  An interesting side note about living in rural Japan... at certain times of the day there chimes a song indicating certain times of the day. For example, at 10 a.m. it's Edelweiss from Sound of Music. There others that play at 8 a.m., and 3 and 5 p.m. but I forget what they are now.  As for stickshift . . . luckily I received a very good lesson from the very pacient Ramon (Cristina's father) so I have been able to survive. I am happy to report that this morning I did not stall at all and I even managed to slow down, brake and all that good stuff without thinking about it too much. I look forward to driving to Cristina's soon since all I have been doing now is driving to work and it takes only 5 minutes.  Oh and in special news, I am awarding Ashley with the ""You are the best friend a person could wish for since you are the oly one to actually comment on my web site"" award. I highly encourage for all of you to email me and write comments.   I would like to find out what is going on in Gainesville!   Remember keep in touch. I miss everyone back home alot.",male,23,Education,Gemini,0
300911,3992888,2004-08-09,"Well I had a good weekend. On Saturday I got up, took a shower, killed a giant spider, then went into the town to see what the paredu (japanese word for parade) was all about. It was really neat. There were people going around the town in groups of 20 or so holding up small gold shrines. They woould either run around in circles or throw it up in the air while going down the streets. People would be spraying water at them with a hose (I guess because it was so hot). Everybody seems to be amazed I dont think its incredibly hot, but it honsetly feels like any summer day in Florida. At one point, one of the leaders of the groups (it was a youndg group) holding up a shrine had them stop and introduce themselves. Some seemed excited, some too shy. I spent a few hours out and about and then returned home to wrap my omiyage (gifts for the office). I spent the rest of the day at home cleaning and fixing up things. Later on, some friendly people stopped by -- the Katos. It was Yu Kato and her sister Kokoro. They were both so nice. Apparently they always adopt the ALT in the town because they are not shy around foreigners and know a little bit of English. The were going to take me to get a cell phone but I still dont have my alien registration card.  Sunday I woke up and watched the news in World News Hour.  It is a program that shows 10-15 min news clips from about 10 different countries.  So I was able to understand the U.S., UK and Italian news.  Cristina then was able to come to my town.  The drive is really not that bad, only 30 minutes and it is very beautiful.  I showed her around Uchinoura and we went to the grocery store to get some sushi and milk tea.  I did not like the milk tea, but I loved the sushi.  Then we drove to Higashi-kushira so I can see where she lived.  The drive back was not that easy because of lack of signs for Cristinas town.  We took a couple of wrong turns and it took about 1 hour to get there.  But we made it.  I didnt like Cristinas town as much as mine (but I still havent seen its shore).  However, I loved her house.  It is small but modern yet traditional.  Everything is new and very accomodating.  She has beautiful horizontal wood paneling all over the entrance of her house.  You first walk in and there is a hallway shaped like a short letter T.  To the right is the toilet room, shower room and utility room (all which are tiled or have wood floors.  To the left is the kitchen with like new appliances.  Then opposite the kitchen you go into the 2 tatami rooms.  Each room is painted green with wood beams.  She has a huge tv and VCR with movies.  Her bedroom has a (drum roll please) a bed.  The only down fall is the fact that her only view is of the rice fields she lives right next to and the mountains in the distance (my town).  After spending some time there, she took me home.  Once home, she dropped me off at the Katos house where I got to roll my own sushi.  They also had me try a meat and potatoes dish and a soy bean paste they call natto.  I also had misu soup.  After that it was off to the rocket matsuri (they are launching a rocket from my towns space center Monday night).  Everyone was gathered at the town square with booths with food, snow cones (i had one), goldfish, masks, etc.  Many women were dressed in kimonos.  There was also a big stage with performances and karaoke.  I was introduced to several people (many of which already knew my name.  At 9 p.m. we went to the port where I saw the most spectacular fire works display.  I guess because they probably dont have many regulations on this stuff and they probably get it really cheap.  It lasted about 40 minutes and the fireworks were bigger than Disneys.  They had ones that exploded different colors and left streaks (like in the states), but they also had some that spinned out of control in mid air or kept on explodiing.  TRULY AMAZING!  Well I gotta go now.  I will speak to you some more soon. Matte ne.",male,23,Education,Gemini,0
300912,3992888,2004-08-06,"Well, right now I am sitting in my office that overlooks Uchinoura. Hopefully I will be able to post some pictures soon. Well I am sure that most of you are already wondering how life has been so far. Well luckily my predecessor has been here (until a few minutes ago when they took her to the airport). Therefore, life with translations has not been that difficult. Everyone has been really nice and been bowing to me all day long. As a matter of fact some guy on a bike that passed me this morning as I was walking to work gave me a free canned caffe latte (it was surprisingly similar to an iced lightly sweetened latte back home)...think Double Shot but MUCH better.  My house...well, I have a big yard but the outside of the house is a little run down, although I do have a traditional Japanese style roof. As soon as you come in you have a genkan where you take off your shoes to step up to the wooden floor. When you first enter there is a hallway. The first room is a large room with a hard wood floor. It is about 15 feet by 12 feet and is an office type room with a hand sink, lots of windows and a separate entrance... I think its kind of like an efficiancy. This is where I brush my teeth and shave (I will tell you why in a second.) Down the hallway there is my toilet room that is maybe 3.5 feet deep and 2 feet wide. It is really nice but only houses my toilet and a sink the size of a softball that only turn on for 2 seconds (literally) when you pull out the knob. My shower room looks like a utility room and it houses my washer. I had a slug come up the side of my tub on the first day. I was freaking out. My predecessor said she never saw one before in there. My kitchen has very nice light colored hard wood floors and has just about everything I need. The next 3 rooms are in an L shape and all have traditional tatami floors with paper wall and lots of sliding doors. I have two large but short coffee tables with some floor chairs, a tv, built in dresser and armoire, a small wooden dresser with mirror and a wall with floor to ceiling windows. One of the tatami rooms serves as a dining room with a normal 2 person dining set and a small book case. This is the room that the mouse lives in that I see every night and the spider that looks like a tarantula (that big too) but is fast like an ostrich. I am thinking of perhaps gardening because everyone here does it but I guess since my house was always for the foreigner that the foreigner never gardened.  Speaking about my town, almost everyones house is traditional (think Last Samurai) with incredible gardens of vegetables, flowers and bonsai. The town is surrounded by these beatiful lush green mountains which meet the sky (I still have not seen their peaks). The town hall where I work si pretty impressive for the size of the town at four stories high (it looks like something out of EPCOT). A little ways down they are building a town center that is the size of the ODome in Gainesville or the Miami Arena which is also impressive. The water in the beaches are blue and crystal clear from what I have seen as I drive next to them (I still have not gone).  A quick comment about the food (SO GOOD!). Today I had sushi 6 pieces and two rice pastry balls (not sure what that is) for about 2.50 american. I bought it at the grocery store ACOOP. They also have fresh sashimi there for about 6-9 dollars. At work they make fresh green tea and coffee at least twice sometimes 3 times a day. I also had ramen yesterday at a small shop that is not like your ramen back home. It was made with fat wheat noodles soaked in this delicious broth of green onions, garlic and (real fatty) pork.  Well thats it for now. Ive been sending out some emails but have not received any replys. I think that my aol may not be receiving new emails. So therefore try to post comments on this web site until I can get a new email. Talk to you probably next Monday because I still dont have Internet at home. (The school computer guy fell off a cliff while fishing, I am not sure what is going on with that). Oh, and this weekend there is a town festival that they keep on inviting me too. My boss asked me to sing kareoke there (I dont know about that... he said YOU SING AMERICAN SONG KAREOKE). Who knows maybe, what do I have to lose.  Oh and I speak with Cristina every night. I still havent seen her because she had her welcome party yesterday and still doesnt have access to her car but perhaps soon. I speak to her every day though.",male,23,Education,Gemini,0
308258,4199699,2004-08-22,"August 22nd...     I had something that wiil be on my list of the most  memorable moment in my life... Or I can say... Moment when i feel the presence  and the plan He's been working on me...     It all start from Yesterday...      As usually I went to my church for the youth  fellowship every Saturday night at 7 p.m. That day I was told that today I'll  have to be on a meeting with all the rest of the committee in the church... I'll  have to represent the youth commitee since I'm the president. It's a regular  meeting held every three months. That time I said that I'll be on church  tomorrow which is today...     Now the story is getting nearer to the problem..       Later that night around 11 p.m. I received a sms  from a friend asking me to go to Carita beach with him the next day which is  today...     The problem is that I already promised to be on  church to follow the meeting..     That time I was faced with two options... It's  whether I keep my promise to be on the meeting or having fun with my friends  which is a rare thing.. Cause I don't spend much time going out with  him...     I must admit that time I was really fond of going to  the beach.. To be honest I never go there before.. Moreover, usually on the  meeting I only need about 15 minutes to report and the rest 2 hour will be used  on things that have nothing to do with my commitee...     So.. I start preparing the war tactics.. I called my  friend... I told him that I'll be going with him to Carita... I prepared my  report and decided to have my sister to give it indirectly to the person in  charge with the meeting...     I finally finished my report around 12 a.m.  midnight... Even I have to had this phone call from a girl I just knew... I  finished my report and I enjoyed the conversation... (Probably i'll put some  writings bout her)     And the plan worked really well... There was no  phone call or sms asking me to go to church.. But it seems that GOD has  different plan for me...     Suddenly my friend called me and said that we got  new company and this person is the sister of my other friend's girlfriend... GET  it??? Ok then.. Well the point is they can't say no to her.. And I have to give  my place... At this point I was really upset with my friend but I never want to  spend my time cryin' on my lowest mood... I always look on the brighter  side..     SEE.. This means that GOD wants me to do my duty and  wants me to be His servant.. Be at the meeting and do my president servant  job... I must admit that time something 'clicked' in my mind... I realize a  couple days ago I just made my promise to serve HIM more and do more to change  my bad attitude.. Well He placed me on the right track... See... If I still  persist to went to the beach probably my position as president will be  questioned... Even though I want to do my best to develop the youth fellowship  they will still questioned my commitment and this is not a good example for  those who's still in my committee team...      And I realize that moment I was making the report...  I really put all my thought and my concern on church.. I can't let others to do  this for me... This is my responsibility...      Well... Let's spend less time talking... ^__^ the  point is I believe GOD is preparing HIs plan for me.. and I shall follow HIs  path for I put my faith in HIM.. There's only one saviour for me, Jesus  Christ... Amen...",male,17,indUnk,Libra,0
308259,4199699,2004-08-19,"Right now I'm feelin' that I want to write  something in English. I don't know why... it just feels better to write it  down  in English...     Today...     August 16th, 2004  Something happened to me and I think this  will be the one thing that will  change  my life... This is  will change the way I  look over  some things in my  life...              It just happened to me that I went to sleep at    5 a.m   this morning and woke up at 12 or  1 p.m.... I forgot... (see... i forgot the time i  woke up ..   this is the start of the whole things that i want to  write down) Have shower  and stuff ...  and my mom asked  me to go to the nearest  ATM... and I did went there... On my way back... I met my friends while i was  still riding  my Karisma... and just said 'HI' to    each other... And suddenly one of my friends called my up and I only  had a chance to say "" wazz up?""    At that time I  didn't really notice that he was taking  someone with  him...   Then... I arrived.. parked my Karisma just in front of my  house... and suddenly he stopped also a couple of seconds after... And I  saw him with a girl... And here's the story begins...  I can't deny that  girl was   gorgeous   and in that couple of     miliseconds   moment I just had my eyes  on her ...      I don't usually look at girls like that... I  know.. Usually when I go out with friends and meet some pretty chicks... I  just u know  admire their beauty.. I enjoy it.... and it goes just like  that.. but this time it's different...  And you know what... I'm a kind of  person who usually get things  when I   'clicked'   with that thing... For example.. I never really  look  for clothes... I usually just walk around shopping places and  when  I find something that 'clicked' my mind ...  and at that  specific moment I know that  ""this shirt is the right  one""....  and that's how I got most of my clothes..  And the same  thing goes here... As I said earlier... I never had that  'clicked' chemistry  when I look at girls until this afternoon...   DAMN..          well, the problem is I  don't know whether she's taken or not... I don't know whether she's going out  with my friend..  I think they have been seeing each other for some time...  cause if not so why do my friend bothers taking her home... and I know my  friend He's not so different from me... Still single until now... still  waitin'  for 'the one' and I think he got it......  Well, here's what I  feel right now...  The feeling of   'in  between' ...  The 'grey' side of black and white.... I surely  got that   milisecond 'click' chemistry  with that  girl... And  I am single .. can't deny that... Can't lie that I've  been longing for that someone... That will fill my days with new things...   Someone to share my love that almost overload...   Someone to care about and  care about me more than  just friend..  Right now... I just can say to myself... you know  you'll find the one when the moment comes...   I'll still look and try my  ways to find that someone..  And moreover... I don't want to wait longer to  start a relationship.. I need to make a step...  Luckily I had    great friends   that able to fill my days..  and makes me survive until now... but I think I'm on the edge right  know... I probably won't be able to hold on anymore longer....  For all  this talks... on top all... for now..    I'm all-right..  That's right..      I'm  CHILL...",male,17,indUnk,Libra,0

312477,3879618,2004-07-09,"Last night Matthew & I looked at pictures in the car under a street lamp.  One year ago.  Literally dancing in the rain (and later the help of a garden hose).  Clothes transparent, sticking to skin and thighs.  Clumps of hair streaking faces.  Dancing like dogs shaking off a swim; all captured in glossy.  Those lovers gone now.  On our way to see a period romance at Rincon Theater.  I needed snapshots of someone else's glossies.  ""A sumptuous film"" indeed.  I'm always drawn to eyes so full and silent they need never speak.  And I always wonder what they're saying.  And what they're seeing in me.  It's rare that I come across eyes like that, even in gelatin.  And so I couldn't sleep.  Instead, I went to the Olive Tree.  2AM and hanging in the branches.  Silent.  Street lamp clicking on again, off again.  Like you and I.  And I told myself, ""This is so rich here alone.  Why give it away?""  Just then a black cat crossed under.  It didn't see me crouching, lounging up high.  ""Tsss.""  It stopped, looked at me startled and then bound up the trunk, ears & cheeks rubbing my legs, nuzzling my hands.  We teased at each other a bit until he could tell I'd lost interest.  He returned to the earth below.  I was a little sad to see him go.  Then a 70s Bronco with huge tires and a lift pulled up at the edge of the park, engine roaring.  Two women - stumbling and loud - clamored out.  And like Maeve straddling the river, pulled down their pants between the Oleanders in a stream of laughter, profanity and piss.  I could hear the puddles gushing, see the legs squatting.  Me unnoticed, reclaiming the silence of deep space as they thundered off in deep bass.",female,27,indUnk,Gemini,1

Singular delicacies deconstructed, with a dash of cinnamon. Always served best in a wine glass; the one I bought for 50 cents at Value Village. As the last puddle of liquid blossom streams from the bottom, I encourage it into my goblet, sliding  two fingers along the inside of the glass pitcher to the lip. Then lick my fingers. Everytime. Everytime I slide my fingertips along that last moment. And then rinse the pitcher clean, swishing the water to catch strawberry seeds. Those seeds love to linger. They don't know there will be a next time.",female,27,indUnk,Gemini,1
312479,3879618,2004-08-03,"Tomorrow is my first day off in fourteen days.  A kind of delirium overtakes me.  I could have spent hours picking out produce at Aqua Vita... spreading swiss chard, plump cherries, snow peas like fallen leaves curled together... After languid lingering and a ginger cookie, I decided to visit the Olive Tree.  My mind needed to wander freely in its branches, without the distraction of my refrigerator & things left undone & the objects of a particular life.  So I swung up her trunk & she graciously held me as pages turned & turned within me, like a book left out in the breeze.  And the full moon sprayed silver from behind wisps of cloud.  Scenes of our meeting drifted through my awareness: ""I came to request that you retract your accusation.""  After a long silence, I said, ""The alchemy that has transpired within me is beyond blame.  I have no wish to rewrite anything.""  And ultimately, faces in hands, foreheads pressed together & silent, the moon blessed our well wishing.  Down from the tree and back to the fruit.  Blood and cherry juice must be kindred spirits. The couch sucked me into a deluge of cherry flesh and slippery pits. One split open on my fingertip and I had to finish what I'd started, smearing cherryness all over my arms, watching the sugars glisten on my skin, juices dripping between fingers. A reminder of the possibilities hiding in each discreet moment.",female,27,indUnk,Gemini,1
315253,3974860,2004-07-20,"Its been a long day. I wasnt too busy at work and actually didnt talk to him today. He did call me around 8ish to see how my day went. I guess he cared enough to call, huh?  What else is there to tell? I think on a whole I am not too sure what kind of relationship he really wants or if he infact wants one. He has always gone out of his way to tell me that he is not the marrying type. But in the past we will be talking and laughing around and he will inquire whether or not I would marry him. Now, although I say that I would I doubt that I would go through with it.      Anyway ~ he is a good guy. He has a good spirit about himself and he means well. But he is a guy . . . what more can I say?",female,34,Fashion,Scorpio,1
315254,3974860,2004-07-20,"I think I might have left off talking about his jealious behavior. He keeps it pretty much under cover, but I see it. I have experienced it.  In some ways its flattering and then in others its confusing. Oh well ~ nothing for me to get caught up in.         I remember the day we met. Oddly enough I didnt know he has a girlfriend, if you will, until the first time we went out. The first date was nothing more than a friendly dinner date. We sat across from each other at the table like two friends. We talked about everything from working to hobbies. Never once discussing girlfriends or boyfriends. He knew I wasnt seeing anyone at the time - but it never came up about his relationship. After we finished dinner we decided to have coffee at a local coffee bar. We sat talking about laughing for about an hour. The shop was closing so it was time for us to leave out. Neither of us was ready to go home, so we went back to his car and sat there talking for hours.  . . talking about this and that. I noticed while he was talking he started rubbing my hand . . . this started after a little joke was told and I think I might have grabbed his hand while laughing. [I am very touchy feely] I didnt move a muscle. It was nice to be sitting with someone talking and they touch you like that. I didnt read anything else into that hand rubbing jesture, although months later it was brought up and talked about. He didnt remember why he did it - but I know from talking to him recently its something he does without thinking about it. Anyway - after about 3 hours of talking in the car. It was time for both of us to go home. He had to be at work the following day and so did I. He got out from the car and walked around to my door and let me out. The door closed and he thanked me for coming to dinner with him and I thanked him for inviting me. He went to give me a hug and when I pulled away from him he kissed me on the forehead. I looked up at him and leaned in a kissed him on the lips [without thinking about it]. When I opened my eyes and looked at his face - he looked a little more than shocked. He responded by saying, ""  . . . uh, you should know I have a girlfriend."" My response, "" thats okay."" With that in mind he opened my car door and I got one more kiss and we both drove off headed home.               He called me to let me know he got home that night and in a very low tone wished me a ""Good Night and I will talk to you tomorrow.""               He and I talked on the phone off and on all the next day. I could not get anything done at work because I was on the phone so much. We talked all afternoon and then again all night that evening. I talked to him from my cell phone going home. It was unreal. For someone who has a girlfriend they must email each other. There is no way he could contact her and be on the phone with me like he was (and continues to be now). The telephone thing has not changed that much since the beginning.                Our friendship started to grow in different ways a month later. Finding myself confortable around him and being that we did talk about ""everything"", flirting with him became more and more intense. Shocking him with little comments and finally caught him off guard one afternoon. I went to his job and we were playing low key - we walked to the breakroom and was laughing about nothing. He commented that I looked nice in a black ankle length Ralph Lauren dress I was wearing. He then asked me, "" What are you wearing under that thing?"" I quickly came back with, ""nothing."" and smiled. His eyes got big and he said he wanted to see. So I walked him to the breakroom and he again inquired. Without saying a word I took his hand in mine, gathered a bit of my dress in my hand, and when my dress got about to my knee I ran his hand up my leg and thigh around my right side and to my behind. I thought the poor man was going to pass out. He quickly opened the door and walked out. And not 3 minutes after he walked out he asked me to see that again and we went back inside the breakroom and he took a look on his own and we kissed  . . . and this was the beginning of another relationship.",female,34,Fashion,Scorpio,1
315255,3974860,2004-07-19,"Four years ago I thought I had hit an all time low in my life when I found out I was pregnant. That was only the beginning . . . My boyfriend, at the time, and I broke up and have not been on good terms since. He doesnt come to see our son and we do not speak. Two years after my son was born I decided it was time to get back into the dating scene. Things were not looking good for me at all. I was not one for going out much so meeting someone was going to be tough. I continued to go to work and come home for a few months.  Ended up dating an ex - and needless to say that was not a good idea. It didnt last. He was coming out of a bad relationship and I was not in one for two years - so we were both a mess. We broke up after two months of dating. Remained friends - less contact than before- but broken up non the less.  About a month later I was introduced to a really nice guy by a friend. (Something I normally dont do because it never works out.)We were seeing each other for about 6 months off and on. He turned out to be a special case. He was well off due to his employment but for some reason or another - he seemed to have to talk about this all the time. . .  as if women only want him for his money. I thought he was attractive, nice body, great smile, wonderful sense of humor - but all of this was shadowed by this gloom of his issue with trust and finance. That of course didnt last long either. I think maybe at this time of my life I go for what I want - and get it 90% of the time. He and I evenually stopped talking . . . and til this day dont speak.  This all leads me to this day . . . I am seeing this guy who is not completely single. I would say he is about 50% single and 50% involved with someone else. I normally do not put myself in situtations like this, but when I met him something about him drew me to him. He has a certain kind of charm, sense of humor, great person all the way around. It was like we were both drawn to each other. He was honest about his situation right off the bat - and I was fast to jump and say it was okay with me. Something I have never done before. I would normally look down on someone who would be in this situation but I cant look at myself and say I am doing something wrong. We have great conversation, go out every now and then, talk on the phone for hours at a time, see each other all the time it seems. I talk to him from sun up to sun down daily. But we are not boyfriend/girlfriend. Our relationship is interesting. He is a guy who is connected with someone else in some form or another. Works 24 hours a day operating several businesses. He tells me time and time again that he is going to help me find someone special to be with because I deserve someone to treat me right. He says I am very mothering. Very caring. Always looking out for everyone before myself. He takes care of me when I need a little help and he is always there for me to talk to.  The weird thing is even though he is claiming to want to find someone for me - he has a jealious side to him too. I can see it in his eyes sometimes. Anyway ~ this is enough for today. I will post again very soon.",female,34,Fashion,Scorpio,1

Since I am use to being in the house ALL DAY it seems, any little outing will do. I actually look foward to going grocery shopping. I mean, who looks foward to that. ME! I love grocery shopping. I love the way my oldest child likes to run around the store playing hide and seek and the way she tries to put any and EVERYTHING into the shopping cart just because she sees mommy doing it.

It's only Happened @ Bina Nusantara University, Especially the International Undergraduate Program 2. There's no physical contact (Read: VIOLENCE!)  Ok Then.... the 3 o-days have already passed... My opinion about it: Terrific! I've never had any of these kind of feeling for those kind of activities.... I mean, the main purpose of the o-days are completely achieved (Once again: To ME ^^). You know The new Campus environment, the cute and pretty seniors (This one is really makes me anxious ^^), and of course the so-called campus life....  ok.... i don't want to be a suck-up guy or somethin, but i really like my seniors... how they put their efforts in the activity... and how nice are they actually (PS: In da reality man, not in the o-days).

(FYI: I'm Catholic).... i can't do that! i don't mean to insult protestants for their ways of worshipping, but deep inside my heart..... my consciousness says: ""It's Just Don't Fit Me!"".... man... i'm kinda confused now, whether GOD accept my thoughts or not. ok, not just that... i have several thoughts that i think are really in the contrary of church's principle..... like the gay stuff.... well, i dont know what will HE do to me...

323065,3361005,2004-05-16,"I'm so confused today. I thought I was in a trusting relationship, but the past few days have really made me doubt those feelings. On Thursday, I came home after work and thought I'd check my home e-mails (I'm on the computer all day at work, so they don't get checked all that regularly). Much to my suprise and dismay, I read an email forwarded to me from some ""girl"" named Kim. It's a conversation between ""her"" and my boyfriend. It basically went something like this: (Kim) Hey, remember me? (Jeremy) No, refresh my memory. (K) We used to chat, I live in OP and remember talking to you. So what's your situation? i.e. Relationship status?(J) I'm in a relationship, but looking for something on the side if that's OK with you. (K) If you're in a relationship, why are you looking for something on the side? Does your girlfriend not do it for you? (J) It's not that, we've just been together for a while and now I'm looking to get into something new, if you know what I mean... And that's basically when the emails were forwarded to me by this Kim ""girl."" So of course, I freak out and my boyfriend ends up telling me what happend. I'm just pissed at this point, but we talk and I'm tired and have to work in the morning, so I just go to bed. On Friday, he forwards me an email that basically lets both of us know that the email wasn't from a girl named Kim, it's from some guy who apparently has feelings for me, but doesn't say anything to me, just tries to break my relationship up. Jeremy says that he only responded like that (the on the side, something new thing) to try and figure out who was behind the email. That he knew it couldn't have been from anyone he'd been chatting with before we got together because of the email address they used. Since asking who the person was wasn't getting him anywhere, this is the route he chose. He now admits that this was the wrong way to handle the situation, but is that only because I found out about it?   I was ready to break it off there, but the things he said made me think. He admitted to ""saying"" what he did and that it was wrong, he swears up and down that I'm the only one he wants to be with, professes his love and asks why, if I love him, won't I try to work things out? So he hasn't done anything wrong...yet. I just don't know what to think. Today I stopped by his place (I missed him, ok?) and we talked again, which of course led to making up. Now he's wondering if I'll still be going out of town with him to his sister's graduation and where we stand. I'm wondering if I should introduce him to my parents (as planned) when they get into town. In one sentence, he's saying we should take it slow and maybe only see each other a few nights a week, he's trying to get stuff done around his house, getting caught up on bills and so on and so forth. I agree with him, that is what he should be doing and driving across town to stay with me every night probably isn't the best decision in the grand scheme of things - especially with his gas guzzler and the price of gas working together to eat up as much money as possible. In the next sentence, he's talking about getting married and having kids.  I know that part of all this comes from the fact that he doesn't think he's good enough - he doesn't have $$ like my family does or whatever. In all honesty, I don't care about all that, but I understand and respect his desire to do so. I'll help as best I can, but I'm still so afraid that he's going to hurt me. My heart tells me he won't, but my head keeps reminding me of the situation this weekend, which makes me ask myself what part of me I should be listening to. I want to be with him, to make this work so badly, but can I trust him and who is this other guy that is trying to get in my heart and be my savior? Such a predicament.

Mandy's in Minn., Laura's in Colorado, my dad's in Baltimore, it's been just me and my mom *shudder* since Thursday.  Today has been especially boring... I watched Deep Blue Sea for the 3rd time in as many days.  Of course, the Red Sox never make it on TV around here, so I can't even watch those games. *sigh*  Oh well... I can smell food cooking downstairs... so I think I'm gonna go eat.  Nic  Mood: Bored, but happy. Music: Politik (Coldplay)",male,17,Student,Aquarius,0
336092,4119694,2004-08-05,"Well, I didn't post yesterday cause I was really busy, so this is a compelation of the last 2 days.  Went to the doc to check and see if I had lyme disease... thankfully I don't.  Then today, I had to go and check in for band and such at school... yuck... I have to go to school next week for band camp... yeah, laugh if you want, but apparently the band camp members are good at sex ;-) (yes, I finally saw American Pie and American Pie 2).  Well, school is starting on a Wed. this year... that blows.  But oh well... I still get to be a senior and get out 5 or 6 days early.  I'm getting way excited for school to start though.  I get to see all my friends again, I get to see Mandy every day (God, that will be wonderful), and it'll be my last year.  Plus, there's drumline season (and the football games, I guess...), band (which I don't care what people say, it's still fun), the choir trip to Flordia, etc. al.  Now if Mandy's ex would just stop being annoying... life would be wonderful :-)  Well that's about it... I'll leave you all with this.   I saw a sunflower growing on the freeway today.   Yes... a real, honest to goodness sunflower... growing right up out of the cracks of an overpass on Hwy 218.  I did a double take when I saw it... or at least, as much of a double take as I could while passing it at 70 mph.  It had grown a couple of feet out of the ground and was as big and bright and perfect as any sunflower could ever hope to be.  As I watched the brave little flower that was determined to hold it's own in the cruel world of concrete, metal, and exhaust that some wayward bird had no doubt left it in, I thought about the children's book ""Hind's Feet on High Places.""  There was a little red poppy in the story that grew from a crack of a mountainside.  As a seedling it had been left there by it's enemies to die... but because it chose to forgive them and love them, it found the strength and the will to survive and flourish in that barren and desolate home.   Sometimes I feel like that sunflower and that poppy.  I've been dropped into a harsh and cold world.  The environment I live in isn't the environment I was created for.  It's so hard for me to remember that the only way I can survive in this world is to let the love and forgiveness of Jesus Christ give me the strength and the will to survie and flourish in the alien world we call Earth.   I'm so thankful I passed that little sunflower today.  It's picture is etched in my mind as a constant reminder that I was not made for this world... but by God's grace I have been equipped to live in it.

336093,4119694,2004-08-03,"Well, today was pretty boring overall... my leg finally stopped oozing... it was pretty ""cute"" (as my mom put it) earlier today.  I got to talk with a good friend I made at the Waterloo Community Playhouse for a while today... that was pretty much the highlight of my day.  I'm in the process of finding a new NFL team I like... not only have the Vikings drafted a former WWE superstar in Brock Lesner, but now rumor has it they are moving to LA in 2007... not cool.  I know Mandy's vote on the matter (the Bears) and Chris' (the Chiefs) and Laura's parents (Packers... *vomit*)... but gimme your ideas :-)  That's about it for me... at least for today.  Hopefully a bunch of us are gonna go see the early show of I, Robot tomorrow... so let me know if you're interested.

336094,4119694,2004-08-02,"Well, today was a pretty damn decent day.  I finally got me one of these lil' Blog thingies, so now I can actually write down what I do and what I'm thinking and such... and then others can read it too.  Yesterday, after church, I basically sat on my butt, it being the first day in 3 weeks without me having to concentrate on the play... then Mike and I went out for Chinese, ice cream, and then we rented Blue Collar Comedy Tour and watched it with his parents... which was humorus in itself, listening to Carla (Mike's mom) laughing harder at the whole thing than we were... wow :-P  Today - My mornings are always boring, filled with chores and stuff... you'll find this a common factor over most of my Blogs... Went and picked up Mandy at 1, came back to my house, and just hung out and talked for the first time in 2 weeks.  She's been gone at Girl Scout camp, and I've been busy with The Buddy Holly story... God, I miss that.  I miss all the people from the play, all the fun times we had, and just the experience that I had while I was there.  If you ever get a chance to act or perform in a play or a musical... jump on it.  It's a great time.  I got bored tonight, so I went and joined Mike's church league softball team, which was exciting.  Church league, and Mike still gets mowed down at the plate by some stupid base runner... the guy got ejected though... and I've forgotten to slide since I played baseball 3 years ago and cut my leg up nice.  I'm glad that my ""family"" is all back in one place again... but sadly, Laura is leaving us again on Wednesday... going on vacation... and then Mandy is leaving on Saturday to go on vacation... and so I'm  either hanging out with Mike, or going to band camp... *blink*.  I don't really wanna get into detail about how my leg hurts, so I'm just gonna go change the bandages on it.   Mood: Mellow Music: Jainy (Five for Fighting)",male,17,Student,Aquarius,0

But man did I have a good time. I even met famous people!!!! Actually I met one famous person and just saw a bunch more.  Kirk Cameron was there. He gave an amazing seminar that really made a lot of awesome points on evolution and such. His story about his life was just so amazing. He taught me a lot. Afterwards I got his autograph then waited around after that to get a picture taken with him. Me, Holly, Kelsey, and David were the ones in the picture. David kept going back and talking to Kirk about either A) his wife or B) Jerry Seinfield. It was so hilarious.  I made a lot of good friendships on this trip, too. I made pretty good friends with Sarah Mangipane. She's really cool. I also got a lot closer to Kelsey and David and Andrew and Angel (grrr, I know, but I couldn't help it) and Amanda and everyone else that went. It was fun. Except for on the last night when SOME PEOPLE wouldn't let me sleep.  The bus was actually a lot more fun. David Castle and David Zambron amused themselves by burping into a megaphone repetedly, David Zambron timed Shane Pritchett as he peed in a gas station restroom because he was sure he could pee for more than one minute (he only got to 45 seconds), and in the next room over Andrew Heberling was peeing (and just to let you know, the next room over was the girl's bathroom; he claims the boys line was too long, but all people who know Andrew probably know better than this).   Some of the other cool peeps I saw were Mercy Me, Stacie Orrico, Switchfoot, Pillar, Rachel Lampa, Lakita Garth (who was this really awesome speaker), Mike Williams (another really awesome speaker, but not as cool as Lakita) and, Of Course, Kirk Cameron. Every time I think about meeting him I feel like pinching myself.  I'm gonna get my pics back in a couple of days, so that'll be really awesome. Then I can actually prove to people that I met him and saw Stacie Orrico. I didn't take pics of the other people, but I did take an entire camera's worth of pictures on the bus. So that'll be good. And a bunch in my tent.   Well now that I've written about an entire novel, I think I'm gonna leave the rest up to your imagination and laugh in your face because I MET FAMOUS PEOPLE!!!!!!! And I also now have a better understanding with Christ which is what I was hoping to accomplish. That was the best part. All of you atheists out there, DONT BE!!!!! Life is so much better with God in it. There's this tremendous amount of comfort in your life and it makes you feel so much better about death because you know exactly where you're headed.

I'm packing so much crap I have to be sure it will all fit. It's for five days, tho, so if you think about it it's probably a good thing that I'm a little over-prepared.   Tomorrow is Holly's 16th birthday. She sucks; she's gonna get her license and crap really soon and leave me in the dust. Bitch. No, I'm just kidding. She's not. But I'm still mad at her. I got her present for her today; a dvd and cd case. And I got her this one notebook thing a long time ago with this gay pig thing named Olivia on it. Sorry, its this thing we have about Olivia. She's our bitch.  Well now I'm gonna go watch Best Week Ever because it is the AWESOMEST show ever. They make fun of crap on it and it's really good. They made fun of Harry Potter the other night; man, I was like laughing so hard I could hardly breathe. It's really mean, but dang is it funny.

Even if I failed the exam, I still won't have to re-take it because they average out semesters and I gotta B last time. So that's good, anyway. I can't wait til I can actually have a chance to get an easy A or B in math. Before, just to get a B, I had to work really hard and I hate that. What can I saw, I'm a lazy butthole.  I'm really bored right now. I think I'm gonna watch ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" right now cuz I LOVE that movie and I feel like watching hot pirates run around. Especially Johnny Depp!!!! Whooo is he a babe!!! Him and Orlando Bloom swordfighting; it's like a woman's wet dream fantasy. Sorry if that's nasty, but if guys are allowed to think perverted things about women, then girls should be able to about guys. At least that's my point of view.  Well now I'm bored and kinda tired.

I totally cannot wait until I really don't have to go back for a whole summer! It's gonna rock!  Only 8 more days until Alive!!!!! I super excited. I've never really been on anything with a church before and it'll be great to get a chance to become closer to God. I really need to go here to strengthen myself. Plus, my friend Holly got me really into this Christian band called Relient K which is a really awesome band. My fave song is ""Sadie Hawkins Dance"". IT's awesome!  If I clean my room out really good over the summer, my aunt's gonna let me get it painted. So man am I gonna kick some butt!!!! I'm gonna go for this like burgendy/pinkish kinda color I saw in this magazine. It's really cool and I think it'll look good in my room. Hopefully anyway.  WEll I gotta go; last day of school being tomorrow and all. Me and Hol are gonna go out to eat tomorrow after she finishes her 7th hr exam. I'm exempted, but math is tomorrow.

I saw a friend with a blog, so I was like ""awesome! lets make one!"" so I did and thats why I'm doing this now. I'm sure no one will prolly ever read this, but that is a ok with me cuz it just kinda takes my mind off things.  On the 4th I went and saw Harry Potter with my pal Holly and her bf Andy and his ma and sister. It was a pretty good time. Then we went to eat at the Olive Garden. Andy's mom was really nice to pay for all of that. I was really respectful of that. We had fun.  Well now I'm officially tired.

338017,3571998,2004-07-17,"I came back from Mackinaw City early this morning (like, midnight) after seeing a play and eating out. It was actually pretty fun; something I wasn't really expecting. I went with Stephanie, Katie Reed, and Kelsey Moore. It was completely free; the play, lunch, dinner, and anything else we wanted if we had enough money. They gave us $25 and we could spend it as we pleased only it was suggested that we use it on, like, meals. I ended up buying lunch at Burger King, a buffet supper, and a Frappicino (I lllllloooooovvvvveeeeee those things!) The play was a little lame but it was still cute and I enjoyed it. Plus, IT WAS FREE (if you didn't already get the memo).   Today I didn't really do much of anything. I watched a little television, finished my book, and am now watching ""I Love the 90's"" and eating a cookie. Awwww, what a life. Guess what?????? ONLY TWELVE MORE DAYS TIL I GO TO CALIFORNIA!!!!!!!!!!! AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Even though I accidently kicked him in the face! But he was trying to flip me over while I was resting on my noodle. Bad move. Then he whacked me in the face with a different noodle. And then Katie jumped in the pool and right when she did the power went off. It was hilarious! She thought she caused it to go out!  Then I spent the night at Katie's house. We crashed pretty early but we weren't exactly sure what time because the power went out at her house too and screwed up the clocks. Even this morning we didn't know what time it was! Then we went back to Horst's. We waited with Justan, Tyler Coats, and Jared Miller until Justan's mom came back home so we could swim. Then he went to football camp and me and Katie swam for like 5 hrs! We were doing flips and crap and being complete losers but it was so fun! We'll prolly go again sometime this week.  I'm going to Cali in two weeks!!!! I'm bummed because I'm gonna miss the fair and Katie's barn theater play, but I'm gonna make her mom take pictures. And the fair always makes me sick anyway.

But the downside to this is that I know have two different tan lines. I assume that these tanlines come from wearing different stylings of shirts while on the workcamp trip (i.e. I wore sleeveless one day, a cutoff the next, a wifebeater the next, etc.). I look kinda funny though.  I went swimming a little while ago, right after lunch actually so I guess it was actually a few hours ago. Wow does time fly by when you're on the internet. I think I'm gonna start e-mailing my pals from workcamp just so that they know I still remember them (even though I'm sure some of them aren't even home yet).

338020,3571998,2004-07-10,"I just got back from group workcamps in Indianapolis, Indiana. It was actually a lot better than I thought it was gonna be. I made a lot of new friends from all over and I also grew closer to a lot of people from Sandusky. It was great.  We worked in groups to help needy people across the city. I was in a group of 6: Myself, Sophia (from Wisconsin), Megan (from Maryland), Cory (from Georgia), Dustin (from Ohio), and our group leader Jennifer, who was in her thirties, from Virginia. It was awesome to meet people from all over. I shared conversations with these Arkansas people who liked listener to my Northern accent. By the end of the week, tho, it was a little more Southern since I was around Southern people so often during the trip.   Some of the people from Sandusky that I made better friends with were Katie Reed, Chelsea Guildenzopf, Justan Horst, Jill Morningstar, Jordan Loding, and just other random people. We seemed to all get along pretty well. When we weren't working we were at this school just outside of Indianapolis and we had seminars and devotions and stuff like that. Free time was my favorite. Then on Wednesday we had a half day and went shopping. Some people went to the mall and others went to the movies, and blah, blah, blah. Shopping people: me, Ashley M, Jordan, Justan, Katie, Andie, Chelsea...Movies: Jill, Beth, Grant, Leslie...Other People who went to other places: Martha, Kathy, Mark.  When we went to the mall we all spent a lot of money...most of us spent all the money we had with us. Ashley Mezo spent about $100, Justan spent like $120 (on 4 things!), and the rest of us all spent about $20. Then we ate out at Stake n Shake. Thats my new fave restaraunt. The shakes are soooooooooooo good. I had a chocolate/vanilla shake. It was delectable.   Overall I had a great time. I also bonded with Leslie who was the girl's chaperone. She's pretty young (about 23 or 24) and we could all talk to her. There were some emotional nights and some really funny ones but altogether I just had a nice time.   Now I'm gonna watch television.

338021,3571998,2004-08-08,"Hey there. Right now I'm in California. It's been pretty fun so far and I've been having a pretty good time even though right now I'm pretty pissed off. Just at ""certain people"" but I won't say who those are. Not yet anyway.  I've seen quite a bit. I'll put it in order for y'all...  Day One: We flew into L.A. from Detroit. Then we went to Anaheim, got a hotel, and went out to supper. After supper we came back to the hotel and watched the Disneyland fireworks because our room looked over all of Disneyland. It was a great view. Then I went back to my cousin Andrew's apartment and my aunt and uncle stayed in the hotel.  Day Two: Got up pretty early and went to Venice Beach. It was fun, I got to put my feet in the Pacific. Then we went to Santa Monica which was BEAUTIFUL. It's one of the most beautiful places I've ever been to. We rode on the roller coastar at Santa Monica pier and walked around. Downtown Santa Monica is soooooo nice. I wanna live there someday.  Day Three: BEST DAY EVER!!!!!!! We hiked in Griffith Park to the very top of a mountain where we had a clear view of the Hollywood sign. I actually had fun hiking! I made it up to the top first out of everyone in my group. Then we went to downtown Hollywood. When we were driving down Sunsent Blvd. I saw the club that Johnny Depp owns!!! ""The Viper Room"" is what its called. Then we went to the Kodak theater which is where they have the Oscars. I sat in Johnny Depp's seat!!!!! It was LOVELY!!!! Then we walked down the Walk of Fame and saw the stars with the famous people's names. Then we went to Mann's Chinese Theater which has all of the handprints outside of it. I put my hands in Judy Garland's, Marilyn Monroe's, and Shirley Temple's. Then I put my feet in Arnold Schwartzinager's, Bruce Willis's, Tom Hanks's, John Travolta's, and Robin Williams's. That was sooooo coool! I took some pics of Drew Barrymore's star on the walk of fame and I even saw two famous people!!!!!! I saw this one lady who was in the movie ""Rose Red"" at Mann's and then I saw Jojo!!!! She was in the car next to me on the way there.  On this day we also went on the Hollywood homes tour. But we did it ourselves instead of going on the bus cuz we got a Hollywood homes map. I'll list the houses that we saw:  Aaron Spelling The Playboy Mansion Babyface Sheryl Crow Wolfgang Puck Phil Collins Osbournes House!!! (my fave!!!)  Then later on we went to Brentwood which is just outside of Hollywood and went to this one place where we walked around and saw another famous person!!! This was someone I didn't know, but she's from the movie ""A Mighty Wind"" and she did look pretty familiar.  Day Four: Did some more Hollywood homes tours (actually a lot of these homes weren't in Hollywood, most were in Beverly Hills, some in West Hollywood, some in Westwood, and some in Bel Air). These are the people who's homes we saw this day:  Pauly Shore Leonardo DiCaprio Donatella Versace Tobey Maguire Michelle Lee Keanu Reeves Britney Spears/Brittany Murphy (it was Spears, but she sold it to Murphy) Charlize Theron Winona Ryder Halle Berry Larry Flynt Michael York Ben Stiller Bob Barker Billy Idol  Then we went to the Getty Center which is this big artsy museum thing with plants and photographs and crap like that. It was pretty boring but it had nice views of the entire city.  Day Five: We went to Huntington Beach which is a very cursed place for me!!!!! First I got taken under by this huge wave and almost died, then I got whacked in the back with a surf board and I couldn't breathe for a little bit, then I stepped on a jellyfish, then I cut my arm on a rock, then I got the worst sunburn of my entire life which hurt so bad I couldn't even sit down.  Lets just say I don't like Huntington Beach.  Day Six: We went to Laguna Beach which was pretty bad for me because I had to wear pants and a t-shirt so I wouldn't get more sunburnt. I wanted to go swimming so I wore my shirt in and almost died in the undertow. The waves here were HUGE, the biggest I've ever seen, but only right up at the shore so no one was surfing (thank God). It was okay.  Day Seven: We went to San Diego and went to the zoo. Mostly we just walked around and looked at a bunch of animals and I tried not to get more sunburned. It was pretty fun. I liked our hotel; we had two suites. It was big but I couldn't sleep all night cuz my sister snored.  Day Eight: We went to SeaWorld which was soo much fun. We rode on a roller coaster that got you all wet called Atlantis, then saw a dolphin show, then saw Shamu, then saw a sea lion show (the best) then we went to see a 3D movie which was the scariest thing ever for me cuz I hate those things. In between all that we saw otters, manates, polar bears, penguins and sharks too. It was really fun though.  Day Nine: We went to a Wild Animal Park in San Diego which was pretty cool. I got to feed and pet a giraffe and came pretty darn close to an elephant. It was nice but really hot so everyone was really tired. But I had a somewhat okay day. Then we came back to Anaheim and stayed at my cousin's apartment again and swam and watched ""Hellboy"" (a really weird movie) and ate Mexican food!!! YUMMY!!!!  Day Ten: That would be today in which we aren't doing anything. I'm on my cousin's computer and everyone is gone to Fries (a big computer store) except for me and my sister. We wanna go swimming later but I don't know if we will. My sunburn is better (it mostly turned to tan) but now on my back it is starting to peel. We leave to come home tomorrow. I'm soooooo ready. Even though California is fun, it's starting to get boring. I miss my friends and my cat and SCHOOL believe it or not. I cannot believe that, but I really do. I wanna see everyone again!!! And now I've actually got good stories to tell everyone!!! and a tan!!!!!  Well, I'm going to go soak myself in juices...",female,15,indUnk,Sagittarius,1

339701,3840468,2004-07-30,"Yesterday, in his speech at the Democratic National Convention, John Kerry explained his views on religion's place in a president's life.  urlLink And let me say it plainly: in that cause, and in this campaign, we welcome people of faith. America is not us and them. I think of what Ron Reagan said of his father a few weeks ago, and I want to say this to you tonight: I don't wear my own faith on my sleeve. But faith has given me values and hope to live by, from Vietnam to this day, from Sunday to Sunday. I don't want to claim that God is on our side. As Abraham Lincoln told us, I want to pray humbly that we are on God's side. And whatever our faith, one belief should bind us all: The measure of our character is our willingness to give of ourselves for others and for our country.  I would like to comment on this. If America is ""not us and them,"" then why does he differentiate between people who ""wear [their] faith on their sleeve"" and people who just ""welcome people of faith."" If he really meant that, he wouldn't even mention the thing about wearing religion on one's sleeve; he'd just paraphrase something Bush said about religion, say he agrees, and explain how it applies to his life, like what he said about Abraham Lincoln. I actually agree with what he said about Lincoln but I doubt he meant it the way Lincoln intended it to mean. Kerry probably believes God is for politically-correctness and against the Biblical view of morality. Lincoln was probably more in favor of the Biblical view.  Jimmy",male,23,indUnk,Gemini,0

339708,3840468,2004-07-21,"Entitlement mentality is the mindset that one deserves/has a right to everything that one wants. A person with this mindset believes that the world revolves around herself/himself. For example, many people who download pirated music have entitlement mentality. They refuse to accept that people's (blue-collar workers) livlihood may depend on earning money from said music. They refuse to accept that people's careers may depend on it. They refuse to accept that the music is worth anything. If you even so much as criticize them, they get defensive and start to talk as if you're trying to take away their liberty. One common argument they use to defend themselves is that everyone does it, even the person who's criticizing them. I read somewhere that even at the hight of downloading, the figure of people who download pirated music was only 21%. (I'm really sorry but I don't have a source for this.) The point is that they're so self-centered that they can't fathom that anyone would behave differently from them. They also argue that the prices are exhorbitant. Even though I used to believe that one, I still didn't consider that justification. Now that I'm in the working world, I know that the price of music is cheap in comparison to things like food and rent. But these arguments mean nothing, not even to the downloaders themselves. They're just  a posteriori  arguments. It's not about the truth; it's about the mindset of entitlement.  Jimmy",male,23,indUnk,Gemini,0
339709,3840468,2004-07-20,"Like many other Christian people, I often gravitate towards children's TV shows when watching the tube. The reason is, of course, that TV shows targeted at adults tend to be full of sin (sex, cursing, moral idiocy). Yet, children's TV shows often present a worldview very similar to that of us conservative Christians. Morality is often portrayed as black & white in children's TV. For example, the SpongeBob  urlLink episode on cursing . (It's funny how the politically-correct crowd still pretned they believe in black & white morality when it comes to kids.) Sex is absent from the plots and there is no getting drunk on weekends. I could give countless other examples of this, especially if I didn't have limited time because of work. Of course, I do watch television programs targeted at adults, such as Charmed and South Park, and I watch R-rated and even NC-17 movies. But when it comes to children's movies, they can be just as bad as adult movies, full of cursing, sex, and drinking. I will admit that I see moral relativism and revealing dress creeping into children's TV shows.  The solution to this is classic TV and classic literature. I love reading Arthurian legends but I hardly read literature at all. I regret not using my free time to read more literature.  Jimmy",male,23,indUnk,Gemini,0

339714,3840468,2004-07-16,"Several months ago, the Episcopal church (the American branch of the Anglican church) approved a ceremony for the blessing of same-sex unions. One of their stipulations is that the ceremony has to be different from a marriage ceremony (where same-sex marriage isn't legal) because it's not a marriage. Now this confuses me. If they want to bless the unions, why not call them marriages (to be seen only as such within the Episcopal church)? Or why not use very similar ceremonies? It's almost as if they're trying to go halfway between seeing homosexuality as sin and seeing homosexuality as virtuous. (I think an argument they use is that they want to accept gays as people.) But that doesn't make sense? I wonder if there are ceremonies in the works for blessing the unions of children and stepparents who are romantically-involved. Why not for brothers and sisters? Why not for grandparents and grandchildren? Why not for aunts/uncles and nieces/nephews? Why not for in laws? For extra-marrital affairs? For sacrificing children to pagan gods?

339715,3840468,2004-07-14,"Translation theology is a way for... I guess I'll call them ""post-modernists""... to teach their theology. The people I'm calling ""post-modernists"" are the kind who do not believe with the Judeo-Christian philosophy presented in the Bible. Instead of just admitting that, they translate the Bible (mis-translate the Word) to reflect their opinions. The latest English example of this I know of is the  urlLink ""Good as New""  translation. Here are some verses from the translation: Mark 1:4 ""John, nicknamed 'The Dipper,' was 'The Voice.' He was in the desert, inviting people to be dipped, to show they were determined to change their ways and wanted to be forgiven.""  Mark 1:10-11 ""As he was climbing up the bank again, the sun shone through a gap in the clouds. At the same time a pigeon flew down and perched on him. Jesus took this as a sign that God's spirit was with him. A voice from overhead was heard saying, 'That's my boy! You're doing fine!'""  Matthew 23:25 ""Take a running jump, Holy Joes, humbugs!""  Matthew 26:69-70 ""Meanwhile Rocky was still sitting in the courtyard. A woman came up to him and said: 'Haven't I seen you with Jesus, the hero from Galilee?"" Rocky shook his head and said: 'I don't know what the hell you're talking about!'""  1 Corinthians 7:1-2 ""Some of you think the best way to cope with sex is for men and women to keep right away from each other. That is more likely to lead to sexual offences. My advice is for everyone to have a regular partner.""  1 Corinthians 7:8-7 ""If you know you have strong needs, get yourself a partner. Better than being frustrated."" If you'd like to see other translations of these passages, you can find them at  urlLink http://bible.crosswalk.com/  and  urlLink http://www.gospelcom.net/ibs/ . I've demonstrated that I do know how to translate (although I admit that I don't know any Biblical languages). However, translation from French to English is not completely unlike translating from Hebrew, Aramaic, or Greek into English. There's always the same quandery, ""Should I keep this like how it looks in X language, should I make it look like something one would say in English, or should I do something in-between."" French-speaking people often say ""to have a right"" when English-speaking people would use ""to be able, can."" For example, ""Click here to have a right to see the new photo of..."" (I think that may have to do with entitlement mentality, but that's another topic.) It looks strange to right that in English but it's normal in French.  The ""Good as New"" version of 1 Corinthians 7:1-2 is ""Some of you think the best way to cope with sex is for men and women to keep right away from each other. That is more likely to lead to sexual offences. My advice is for everyone to have a regular partner.""  The King James version is ""Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote unto me: It is good for a man not to touch a woman. Nevertheless, to avoid fornication, let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband.""  The KJV's ""wife"" and ""husband"" become ""regular partner"" in the ""Good as New."" It's very easy to explain why this is a miss-translation. ""Wife"" and ""husband"" suggest a marriage ceremony. ""Regular  urlLink partner "" suggests a girlfriend/boyfriend where marriage hasn't necessary taken place. This ignores all the verses in the old testament that give  urlLink wife  and  urlLink husband  clear definitions.  Jimmy",male,23,indUnk,Gemini,0

I fear what will happen when this movie reaches China, the Middle East, and Africa where crimes against Christians are an everyday thing. One of the stars, Mandy Moore, said "". . .the message of this film is not about mocking Christians. It isnât anti-anything at all. It is about discovering who you are and what you believe in.

I have seen countless similarly anti-Christian messages in Hollywood films. If this movie was really about intolerance, the antagonists wouldn't need to be Christians. In fact, it would be better if they weren't, so itcould teach the viewers that intolerance exists outside of Christianity. But the movie really isn't about intolerance, now is it?

So naturally, multiple people in the audience will recognize that name as a deceased relative.  But this also applies to multiculturalist apologetics.

For example, one shaman described an infection as demonic possession. At the time, I was naÃ¯ve enough to believe almost all of what he said.

He wanted us to go away from his speech believing that the key to humanity's salvation lied in the tribal societies being destroyed by western/capitalist imperialism.

Are you an American liberal or someone from Europe who thinks those fairy tales teach values that no longer need to be promoted in today's world? Well, RWN is coming to your rescue with our ""Politically Correct Fairy Tales!""  =====  Hansel and Gretel  Hansel and Gretel were lost in the woods when they came upon a house made of candy and cake. An old witch invited them in and then captured both of them intending to eat them. Gretel had a chance save both of them by pushing the old woman in an oven but she decided that it would be wrong not to respect the witch's cultural traditions. So Gretel and her brother allowed themselves to be cooked and eaten. The witch was so happy with the children's actions that she invited all of her witch friends to the area. Soon thereafter, they ate every child in a hundred mile radius. Soon the whole area was filled with nothing but child eating witches and all the witches were very happy!  The Moral of the Story: You must respect the culture of others, even at your own expense!  =====  Fisherman and the Fish  An old man finds a fish. The fish says ""Let me go, old man. I will reward you for my freedom by giving you anything you desire"". The old man at the behest of his wife makes wish after wish. Finally, the fish decides the old man and his wife are being too greedy and takes everything he gave them away. Then the man and his wife hire Johnny Cochran and sue the federal government for not having federal regulations in place to prevent wishing fish from unfairly taking away previously given magical spoils. The judge ruled in their favor and they were both given 500 million dollars worth of taxpayer funds with which they lived happily ever after.  The Moral of the Story: It's the federal government's responsibility to fix every bad thing that happens in the world.  =====  The Three Billy-Goats Gruff  The first and second billy goat gruffs were stopped from going across a bridge to get food by a troll. Then the biggest and baddest billy goat gruff showed up. He told the troll he was going to kick his @ss. That greatly upset the first and second of the billy goats gruff who accused the third billy goat gruff of ""hegemony"" and ""imperialism"" and said that negotiation was the way to go. So the third billy goat gruff went away. Unfortunately, the troll refused to negotiate and first two billy goats gruff starved to death.  The Moral of the Story:It's better to starve to death than to fight!  =====  The Three Little Pigs  There were once three little pigs. The first little pig built his house out of straw. But the big bad wolf easily knocked it down. Then he ran to the 2nd pig's house which was made out of sticks. But the wolf came there and knocked it down too. Then both pigs ran to the American pig's house which was made out brick. When the wolf came there, the American pig pulled out a gun and blew his stinking head off. Afterwards, both little pigs who lost their houses started building their houses out of straw again. When the American pig asked them why they accused the American of being an ""arrogant jerk"" and of ""acting unilaterally"". But they secretly knew the American would always save them, just like he did in WW1 and WW2 so they could afford not to be prepared.  The Moral of the Story: Even though Americans are helpful, they're real creeps!  =====  The Ants and the Grasshopper  All summer long the ants worked and prepared for the winter while the grasshopper went to Rage Against the Machine concerts and played Everquest. The grasshopper laughed and laughed at the ants for working so hard. Then winter came. The ants had plenty of food and shelter while the grasshopper had none. So the government took the ants tax money and built the grasshopper a house, gave him welfare cheese to eat, and paid for courses at the local university that the grasshopper didn't bother to go to.

This is my second time doing W3.  I finished it a week ago, but I got sick and wasn't able to move on to W4 right away.  I was barely able to get the energy to get out of bed to feed the cat so running was out of the question.  I'm feeling a lot better now and I've decided to repeat W3 and start W4 strong.  3.) How do you feel?  Since I hadn't run in 9 days and I'm still a newbie I figured today would be horrible.  I was paranoid that I'd have to go back to W2.  Luckily, I made it through today's run.  4.) Will you move on next week?  Yes  5.) Tell us your thoughts.  I'm just happy to be running.  6.) Are you taking extra time off to recover?   No, I'm not even that sore after the runs yet.",female,25,Technology,Virgo,1
346997,3496847,2004-06-23,"Finally, weeks of listening to the politicians pick on each other.  Soon the government of Canada will have a new make up - all the new and returning MPs will head to Parliament, to pick on each other. I don't like the Canadian government.  I don't like the provincial government (Ontario or Nova Scotia.)  But I do vote.  There is no way that I'm not going to have my say.  I won't let others speak for me.  **I can't let Stephen Harper be our next PM.  If he got in and I didn't vote, I'd have to emigrate.  I couldn't complain about him and admit that I didn't do my part to try and keep him out of power.**   Issues that are important to me:   Health care  - free national health care is great.  Taxing the crap out of us for it sucks (Dalton McGuinty - I'm talking to you.  How dare you take $25 dollars a month more from me - I just get by as it is.  Don't you make enough off the interest I pay on student loans?)  Our health care is part of what makes Canada great.  It's lacking dental care.  Teeth are an important part of overall health.  I've never understood why it's not subsidized like other health services.  And we need more rural doctors.  I lived most of my life in NS without a primary care physician.   Education  - tuition in Canada is too high, and financial aid is not the answer.  I have a degree, and poor parents, therefore I have $30 000 in student loans to pay back.  Education makes our country better, but debt is making me consider (seriously) leaving the country.  If I'm going to be broke, why not be broke in an interesting setting?  Taxes  - we have some of the highest taxes in the G7.  Is it really necessary?  Are our taxes going where they are needed and promised to be going?  See the sponsorship scandal.  Drive on the highways and pay for gas. ****** I've voted - now it's time to watch the returns (and bake cookies.)",female,25,Technology,Virgo,1

Before I even shower!  I feel lazy on the days I don't run.  Once my running is under control I'll do more crosstraining.  Running is enough *new* in my life.  I don't want to overdo it and give up on running or exercise again.  I want to make a lifestyle change and have a fun hobby.  Running works for me, but not if I go all gung-ho and wear myself out.  Then I just give up and go all lazy.    Since my runs have been getting more difficult, I've decided to break them down by day.  I'll still only post them once a week, but I'll talk seperately about each run and the week as a whole.   Day 1  - today's run was tough.  I had to stop for 15s at 2mins into the last 3min interval.  My calves were killing me, so I did a quick stretch.    Day 2  - better run today, but that last 3min interval was tough.  I read my watch wrong and stopped about 10s too early.  I made up for that by making the last running interval 2mins, not 90s.  I wanted to run until my watch beeped.  I set it for 20mins and count down the intervals from there.  There's a certain satisfaction in only stopping when the timer goes off.   My watch is a Timex  Rush .  It has an alarm, a stopwatch, and 10 pre-programmed timers (1, 3, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 45mins and 1 hour.)  And the display is a good size.  I can read it with just a quick glance.  It's hard to read in low light, so I might replace it before winter (maybe with a Garmin Forerunner.)  I'd recommend it as a decent beginner's watch.  Okay - sorry for the sales pitch.  Day 3  - I din't make it through the whole run today.  It seems that I've caught a cold.  I'm going to take the weekend to recover.  If I'm not feeling absolutley dreadful on Monday I will try Week 3 again.  I'd like to be confident that I did a good Week 3 before I attempt Week 4.     Overall  - My legs were more sore this week.

The WB is bad reception because it's not being broadcast in Canada, TO just happens to be close enough to Buffalo that we can ""eavesdrop"" on their station.

Was there a third season?

I haven't actually downloaded any episodes yet, but season 3 started recently, so I may  Gilmore Girls  - For the season finale the Canadian carrier (Global) was a week behind the US carrier (WB) because of a documentary they aired.  I couldn't make the WB watchable on the night they aired it so I downloaded it over the weekend (instead of waiting until Wednesday on Global) and watched in many times.

Plus the heat and humidity here are too much for me, and I need cooler clothing. I bought a dress, some capris, a few shirts and a new cardigan. I love a good cardigan, they're versatile, but a good one is hard to find. I'm not a big clothes horse, so black or navy blue is the way to go. Coloured cardigans don't match everything - I like a good mix-and-match wardrobe. I hate picking out what to wear in the morning, and for a girly, I'm not that fond of shopping for clothes.  My best friend and I went shopping on our lunch break yesterday. She just works down the street from me - close to the mall, so we met up. She needed a strapless bra for a cute outfit she bought to wear to a wedding today and I was looking for new sandals. She got a good bra, but it was in the ""plus"" section. She's a 38C. How is that a plus size? She's a size 10 in clothes - thin but not grossly skinny (i.e. Lara Flynn Boyle and Paris Hilton.) I can't believe what passes for sizing in clothes these days. I'm built about the same as her, but shorter - she's 5'9"", I'm 5'6"". We are not overweight.

There should be a standard size chart for clothes sold in Canada. It could be North America; I don't really care. Just a standard of some kind. I don't care how the label it. There could be a scale for petite people (under 5'4"" - that's right Ma, I'm not petite), hourglass figures, straight-shapes (no waist or hips - like me)....

347012,3496847,2004-06-07,"I saw the new movie yesterday.  **You may not want to read this if you haven't seen the movie yet.**  I tend to go on the Net and read all the reviews of a movie after I see it - I hate knowing other people's opinions before I see a film.  I agree with the critics who have said that it is impressive visually, darker than the first two movies, and maybe a bit too scary for the younger children.  However, I found that too much was left out.  I am a fan of the books, but I do understand that they can't be translated to the big screen word-for-word.  In my opinion, there were two major points in the book that were left out of the movie.  The first makes the film it a bit confusing for anyone who isn't familiar with the book.  That would be the relationship between James Potter (Harry's dad), Lupin, Sirius Black and Peter Pettigrew.  I noticed it in the film when Harry is caught by Snape in the hallway at night.  Harry was using the Marauder's Map to follow Pettigrew.  Lupin saves Harry from the wrath of Snape and takes him back to his office.  Lupin knows that the blank piece of parchment Harry had on him was a map - he says so to Harry, but Harry never questions how he knew that.  Nor does Harry interogate him about Sirius or his dad.  I thought this was a serious oversight.  I was confused a bit, and I had re-read the book last week.  I also missed seeing the true Hagrid.  How happy he was to be able to teach a class, and how sad he was over the incident with Buckbeak.  He genuinely cares for the students.  The CGI creature was excellent, but it seemed out of place.  Without knowing what a good pet he was to Hagrid made that arc seem like a device just to allow Harry and Hermione to rescue Black.  I was glad to hear Hermione call the creature ""Beaky"" as they were leading him into the forest.  I do think there were parts of the movie that were very good:   I liked the scene in the boy's dorm where they are eating candy that makes them make animal noises.  It seemed like a realistic portrayl of 13-year old boys at boarding school. The chemistry between Ron and Hermione is progressing nicely.  It's very obvious in the fourth novel, but they are handling it well in the films. The Whomping Willow - because I hate birds too.  They sit outside my bedroom window, starting at the crack of dawn, torturing my cat.  She has to walk across me in bed to get to the window to meow at them.  I loved seeing the tree destroy the birds.  Quidditch - need more be said.  Always a good scene. The Dementors.  I avoided the previews because I didn't want to see them before I saw the movie.  I heard that they are similar to something in the Lord of the Rings films, but I don't know.  I was the first one and hated it, so I haven't watched the others.  The Dementors didn't look like they do in my mind, but they were very convincing.  I didn't expect to see them fly.  I saw them a gliding just above the ground.    You would never know that I was an adult - the way I go on about a children's film :) ****** Oh, I'm still running.  I did Week 2 Day 1 this morning.  I'm gong to run every second day.  I find it to be too hard to do two days in a row lately.  Too many stairs in my building.  Whoever said a four-floor walk-up is cute should be shot - Opps, that was me.

347024,3496847,2004-07-03,"I have not had any luck this weekend.    Wednesday, just before 5, I got my finger caught in the safe at work.  It hurt - a lot.  I'm still surprised that I didn't cry and/or curse.  I have a pretty high tolerence for pain.  I'll make a show of it, curse and complain, but I can handle it pretty well.  I've broken bones and had things pierced and been okay.    So I got my finger jammed, freed it and ran to the kitchen to put it in cold water.  Under the nail had turned pruple immediately.  A co-worker ran and got me ice.  It wasn't broken so I went home, taking the ice pack on the subway with me.  I woke up Thursday and it hurt more.  It was swollen, the purple under the nail had expanded and turned black.  I spent Thursday in pain, and advil wasn't doing anything.  Friday my finger was even worse.  It throbbed.  I had to keep it elevated and if anything touched it I was near tears.  I went to the dentist for impressions of my crown.  The freezing wore off before he was done working.  More pain, just what I needed.  I then visited a friend, walked around TO to try and get my mind off my finger and picked up a few things at Wal-mart.  I walked from the Eaton Centre to Bay & Bloor and then around the U of T campus for a bit.  My mind never forgot about my finger and then I was tired and cranky.  I took a cab home from Wal-mart.  I tried to change my clothes once I was home and when I was taking off my shirt it touched my finger and it hurt - I was in tears and had to sit down.    So I went to the clinic.  I knew what had to be done to get rid of the pain, but it didn't sound like fun.  The doctor needed to drill a hole in my nail and let it bleed to relieve the pressure.  He held my hand down - I was lying down thank goodness, held my finger tight (pain) and started to dig a little whole with a needle (more pain).  He got through the nail (lots and lots of pain) and started to squeeze my finger to force the blood out (pain).  After about two squeezes I could feel the pressure letting up.  He spent about five minutes squeezing my finger.  He kept saying that I should of come in sooner, and that this is a terrible pain to endure for two days.  If the pressure comes back then I hould go to a clinic right away.  I promised I would - and I will if necessary, it hurt while he was doing it, but I'm much better today then I was yesterday.    My finger hurt all night from the squeezing, but I slept like a log and woke up in less pain.  Typing hurts, so that's it for now.",female,25,Technology,Virgo,1
347665,3732995,2004-06-23,"So i just got a blog, not sure why but ohwell.  Today was good. Woke up VERY late as usual. My friend Tuesday that's staying here is really getting on my nerves. I'm sure I'm getting on hers as well. Joz called and wanted to go to the beach, but it was raining to we decided to just go to her house. I called Katey and her, Tuesday, and I all went to Joz's. There we met Bill and Tal. We all watched Donnie Darko. Yes I'm getting sick of that movie. I know it's hard to believe because it's like the best movie, but this was like my 8th time watching it. Ohwell, it was good the first three times. So then we all went to Taco Bell and ate. Then Tuesday and I went to Kateys house while Tal Joz and Bill went to the beach. We were just being silly at her house and took pictures pretending to play basketball.. yeah wtf? I don't know.. I downloaded that ""sail away sail away"" song by Enya and we were blasting that for a while. Ha Joz saw our away message last night about Van Morrison and she had downloaded ""Brown- eyed Girl"" Ha, that was funny. Last night on AIM, Kevin saw my crazy Van Morrison away message too and said he liked that song too. I can't wait to see him. It's so wierd like I don't like him that way at all but he likes me, and like noone likes me. Kevin's adorable too, so I don't know whats wrong with me. I'm too busy liking wierd people like Mike Singer and Milt. Hm. I really should move on with my life.  But anyways then Bill picked us all up and we went to Jocylyns Youth group thing. I could tell Katey and Tuesday were really bored. They kept looking at me lik ""ok when can we leave"". Yeah I guess it was pretty boring. Rhonda was there and she hates me I think so that was wierd. I met Jocylyns friend Melody, and shes really nice. I was lisstening to the sermon and the songs, but I didn't really feel God's presence. I really wanna be closer to God. Like I think I'm already pretty close. First of all I believe in him and I have faith in him. I pray every night for my family, friends, and for myself. But I guess theres more I could do. I don't know. So many of my friends don't even believe in God, and those who don't really like follow him you know? Like Natalie is the only one. Liek I don't know I think I'm just more private about my faith. I don't really like going to church that much because worshipping with other people just feels wierd to me. I hope that doesn't make me a bad person.. I don't know.  Another thing is I really care too much what people think. Most people hate me or whatever so that makes things worse. I know I'm hard to get along with sometimes, but a lot of people that don't even know me judge me. That's really not fair. Like this year has been the worst year of my life. People have just betrayed me in so many ways, and I just don't depend on anyone anymore. last night Mike told me that everyone at Allderdice thinks I'm a joke. I don't think that's true. People liek him just liek to bring others down, and that's just not cool. I need to stop living in the past though. I need to figure out who I am and just not care what others think. I need to find me and be comfortable as me. I just know I can't live another year like I lived this year. Ohwell. I think we're about to go pick up my Grandma at the airport.

353346,3984432,2004-07-21,"Welcome to the online magazine ""ON TOP of the world"", which stands for ""Opinionated News for Ticked Off People of the World."" (If you're wondering why the title is so longwinded, you obviously don't know me very well... give it time.) Our goal is to make this a place where you can come to listen to people sit on their asses and complain about the issues that you sit on YOUR ass and complain about! Because I cannot lean any further right, politically speaking, without falling over and hurting myself, I've decided to get together with my liberal friend, Matt Collette, to create this publication. Only Fox News - one of the most middle-of-the-road TV stations ever secretly controlled by Ronald Reagon - has been able to provide such fairness and balance up to this point in time.   Some of you may be wondering why I'm writing an introduction to this website when my colleage has already done so. The reason is that his introduction sucks. First of all, he was very informal. Now don't get me wrong - I'm all for an informal publication. But in an editorial there is a certain professionalist feel that needs to be given. Second of all, he keeps calling this a ""blog"". I know that that is the technical name for this type of website, but we are merely using this form to create an online magazine.   I told him these things, and told him that he should fix it, though really I was thinking that I should have been the one to write it, anyway - I am, after all, the Editor in Chief. He suggested that I write my own if I wish, as it would showcase our differences. Well, I guess in that we have succeeded, for you can already see that he is wrong and I am right. That, I imagine, will be the general tone of this publication.   For those of you who don't know me well, I am infamous for these online writings for two reasons: one, I do not update them frequently; and two (and this is the biggie), I have been known to offend people. The last time I attempted something like this, I ended up having to fend off an entire army of skateboarders. If you want a lesson in the benefits of joining a union, go ask the skateboarders - trust me, those mothers can band together like Baptists at a Catholic boarding school.   Well, I suppose that I should wrap this up shortly. Please - check back often for updates. We plan on discussing a hot issue from two points of view - Matt's and my own - on at least a weekly basis, and will be adding personal updates frequently, too. We may even pull in some guest writers, if we don't scare everyone away too fast. Most importantly to note is that we have no idea what direction we're going with this, so not only do we welcome your input, but we probably will need it if we want to save ourselves from looking like asses.   And remember - if there's an issue that needs to be discussed, we'll be ""ON TOP"" of it. And hopefully without too many lame, cliche jokes and taglines.

353348,3984432,2004-08-15,"Here are some common reasons that people use when describing why they think that John Kerry should be president... followed by facts that prove these ""reasons"" to be nothing but pure fiction.  1 - DONT vote for Kerry because ""he would not have dragged us into war."" According to a recent statement from Kerry, even if he had known that Sadam did not have weapons of mass destruction, he still would have brought us to war JUST LIKE BUSH DID - in fact, Kerry states that he would have made all the choices that Bush made, including acting without UN sanction, but that he just would have made different wartime choices in the actual battles.  2 - DONT vote for Kerry because ""he will work for the average American, not just the rich."" Okay, here's a newsflash:  Kerry is rich, his biggest supporters are rich, and - just like every other politician in US history (including, I'll admit, Bush) - he's never going to do ANYTHING without at least a little consideration for those paying the bills.  Yes, Bush gave tax cuts to the rich, and gave less to ""middle America.""  But consider these two facts:  first of all, the rich (obviously) have a lot more money, so giving every million- and billionaire $100,000, for example, is the same percentage as giving a guy who makes $30,000 a year a grand back; second, Bush gave SOME money to the middle class, and tried to give even MORE, but guess who voted against it?  That's right, John Kerry.  Kerry voted AGAINST tax cuts for the middle class, even though now he's yelling at Bush for not doing it.  Plus, before you think that Kerry is really going to be a man ""for the masses"", remember that 99% of the entertainment industry (think Michael Moore, DMB, Michelle Branch, and the omni-present Susan Surandon/Tim Robbins duo) has come out to support John Kerry - and these are the richest 1% of the American people!  You can bet your ass that if Kerry really was going to play favorites any less to the wealthy than Bush would, America's richest wouldn't be showing Kerry their support.  Think about it.  3 - DONT vote for Kerry because ""our economy is bad and he needs to fix it."" America has just gone through the biggest job growth in US history.  The stock market is starting to go up.  Sure, the economy wasn't the best for a little while, but then again we had just gone through September 11th - an event that cost us $100 Billion, not including the wars in Afganistan or Iraq (and let's not forget that one of the reasons why the economy seemed so good in Clinton's time was that he SEVERLY cut defense spending - something that seemed to do us a damn lot of good in Fall of 2001, didn't it?)  Some people say that the economy is bad, and we need Kerry to fix it, but this simply isn't true.  There's nothing wrong with the economy.  Jobs are being created at historic levels, companies are all on rebounds, AND while oil prices are rising, the growth is considerably less, when taking into account inflation, than it has been many times over the past 35 years.  Here's another thing to ponder:  if Bush was not the way to fix the economy, why would every economic group in the US, including Wall Street, be backing him and his policies?  4 - DONT vote for Kerry because ""he was a great soldier and knows about war."" According to a new book, Unfit To Lead, in which more than 240 men who served in Viet Nam on the same watercraft as did John Kerry (including many in his unit) contributed, Kerry has lied time and time again about his war record, including where he served and what he did.  For example, he said that on Christmas day he was in a location that it would have been impossible to get to, and when pointed out this fact, Kerry said something along the lines of ""oh, well maybe I didn't go there.""  Sure, there are groups like Veterans for Kerry that support him, but these men did not serve with Kerry and many, including one of there top spokesman, didn't do anything war-related even close to what Kerry did, and so is about as useful a source as I am describing college-level physics.  Furthermore, an overwelming majority of our nation's veterans support Bush, and that certainly says something.  5 - DONT vote for Kerry because ""he believes in what I believe in."" To be honest, Kerry might believe in exactly what you believe in; the problem is that no one really knows for sure!  Kerry has been flip-flopping back and forth on almost every issue over the past few years, particularly since the campaign started.  Kerry says that he doesn't believe in abortion, but according to his voting record he has voted FOR abortion - in all sense of the word, mind you, meaning that he has voted for ALL abortions (including, therefore, late-pregnancy ones) - on dozens and dozens of occasions.  He says that he doesn't believe in gay marriage, yet he has voted FOR gay marriage many times and has supported Massachussetts's plan to make gay marriage legal.  So no matter where you stand on these or any issues, it's rather hard to tell if John Kerry is on your side or not!  Those are some reasons NOT to use in deciding to vote for John Kerry.  If you still have reason to do so, then by all means, give him your support.  But you'd best not vote for him for those reasons because - and probably many others - because they are not truths but are merely lies from the Kerry camp trying to steal away your votes.",male,17,Student,Aries,0
353349,3984432,2004-08-06,"I apoligize that my post is going to be brief, but it is based on the fact the  I really couldn't agree with Corey much more . Though Americans are divided, they are divided for the  same reason ; they want America to be the best it can be but differ in their opinions as to how do do it. This delimma has been the same throughout history - parties have also bickered and attacked ideas and politicians.  Though the issues we argue over are different today than they were in the late 1770's, we argue for the same reason. Each side wants to make American the best it can be, but each side sees a different route that America must take. Imagine this in terms of two different family vacations:",male,17,Student,Aries,0
353350,3984432,2004-08-05,"In the months following the terrorist attacks of September 11th, 2001, the phrase ""united we stand"" became a popular saying, almost to the point of becoming a cliche.  At the time, I took it to be a war call, a method of intimidation to America's enemies that we were not a people who would allow such an attack to go unpunished.  It was an attack plan, a call to arms, and one that resulted in one of the most unifying efforts in American history.  During this period, there was a lesser-known clause which I had also heard from time to time: ""divided we fall.""  Swept up in the wave of patriatism and eagerness to bring those who had attacked us to justice, I paid this phrase little heed.  Indeed, for a short time it seemed that most Americans couldn't even remember a time when we were not united under one cause.  Since that ""fatefull day"", as it has so often been called, almost three years have gone by, and much has changed in our country.  Much of what has occured during that time have become the major issues in the upcoming election; the state of the economy, the reforms made to national security, and the wartime decisions and actions made all seem to be key factors in who Americans will be giving their votes to in November.  Of  course, as a young, politically-minded American, I share some concern in these election-related areas, and have certianly considered them over the past few months.  But to me, a much bigger and more pressing issue has emerged as things have heated up in the States, and that is the unity of our people.  Back when the founding fathers of our nation met to fight for and shape a new country, they were not nearly as agreeable and one-minded as many textbook interpretations have led us to sometimes believe.  Just like we do today, in the twenty-first century, the revolutionaries of the 1700s had their share of controversies and disagreements.  Whether arguing over how many delegates each state should get in the legislature, where to locate the nation's capitol, or whether the fedralists or the antifedralists had correct notions in regards to state-versus-federal power, the brave men and women who created America were certianly in near constant disagreement.  To some modern people, it appears to be miraculous that our country was created at all.  How, with all of this disagreement, had their been enough strength to create what quickly became to most powerful nation on earth?  The answer, I believe, is that for all of their differences, our founders were united in a single cause: to create and protect a free and just country.  At the end of the day, when the debate hall doors were swung shut and the newly-dubbed Americans made their way back to their homes, they were all united, despite their differences.  And when it was time to fight and to protect that which they loved, our brave forefathers thought not of what they disagreed on but rather on what brought them together.  This amazing bond between every man and woman in America remained strong.  Many times, it waivered slightly, and once - in the Civil War, the darkest of times in history - the forces that drove America apart did, for a brief period, outweigh the bonds pulling it together.  But now I ask you: where is this unity that has so long served and empowered our people?  What has happened to the bonds that have for so long kept us together?  Over the years, America has learned to express itself, to speak out against injustice, and to make loud and unyeilding calls for reform; but despite all that we have learned, we have forgotten to be united, and to stand together as one great people.  I know that this unity is waivering when the entire ""Current Events"" section of the local bookstore is filled with publications called the President of the United States an idiot or a liar, or when the leaders of our nation are referred to as ""stupid white men""; likewise, I can feel it dying when I hear the Democratic National Convention being called the ""meeting of our enemy"", and when political ads suggest that anti-war means anti-patriotic.  The problem, I believe, has developed because many Americans have forgotten two things: first of all, that one can disagree with another while still showing that person respect; and second, that despite our differences, Americans have always and do now share one goal, and that is to make our nation and world the safest, most productive, and most free that it can be.  Too soon have we forgotten that we can express our differences without overshadowing our similarities; too soon have we forgotten that we can hate a man's idea but still love the man; and too soon have we forgotten that the ties that bind us far outnumber and overpower those that would tear us apart.  So now when I say ""united we stand"", it is more than an empty slogan, more than a call to arms in a desperate time; it is a powerful and all-important reminder that if we hope to achieve anything, we must work towards it together - not as enemies or competitors in a political arena, but rather as sons and daughters of America, and fighters for freedom and justice.  Of course, we will sometimes disagree, and we will surely never be in complete agreement; but if hatefulness, negativity, and mudslinging have any place, it is not in the America that I know and love.  Above all else, we must not become a people divided.  So when asked what you are, do not answer that you are a Democrat or a Republican, a member of the Reform Party or a member of the Green; but rather, answer that you are an American, for only through unity and brotherhood can our individual voices be heard and our beloved freedom be proected.",male,17,Student,Aries,0

This above photograph is of the last projects I did.  This is a picture if the CD itself, and was quietly released in 2002.  Only quietly because Exotic Fever was still very young at the time and we didn't do much press or promo for it.  However, we had many up and coming, as well as, well established independent artists work on it.  It was sold through some major distributors on the independent level, but was still slow at moving, and out of only 2000, 800 are left now.  So I can save myself the time of typing I will just insert someone else's text about this compilation so that you may understand what this is:      ""Catherine Lewis reports: Exotic Fever records has just released a 20-track compilation unwieldily titled Don't Know When I'll Be Back Again: A Compilation to Benefit American Veterans of the Vietnam War. This compilation, which was two years in the making, features Vietnam War-era songs passed through the jaded filters of today's indie-rock stars. Artists like Death Cab for Cutie, J Robbins (Burning Airlines/Jawbox), Q and Not U, and Ted Leo recorded songs by legends like Led Zeppelin, The Stooges, Jimi Hendrix, and Jefferson Airplane, in honor of Vietnam's veterans.   The star-studded compilation benefits the Vietnam Veterans of America (VVA), an organization which was founded in 1979. According to Bonnie ""Deleted name out, you can easily find it"" of Exotic Fever Records, the VVA's Benefits Program ""provides free legal representation for veterans in front of the Department of Veterans Affairs, assisting them in getting the compensation they need and deserve from disabilities incurred in service.""

Proceeds go to The Vietnam Veterans of America's benefits department.  Where I worked as a paralegal, where the ""real deal get your hands dirty and take care of some shit"" work happened.  This is also were I met my husband.  He did the even ""dirtier"" work of lobbying, writing legislation and testimony for congress.  He worked in the government relations dept.  That's where we fell in love, and what a place for it to happen.   Anyway, I myself had only done a couple of releases before hanging up my towel, at least for a little while.  This was my last one. My daughter Campbell came along, and ""surprise!"", changed the whole course of my life.  (But not wholly).  I'm due for working on another benefit compilation cd to be produced and released under Exotic Fever Records sometime late fall.  Katy Otto, the woman who now mainly runs the label with another good friend Sara, and I  played several years together in a band (Bald Rapunzel).  Katy and Sara and a couple of other folks have brought this label to a whole nother level.  Which is fantastic!  It still might take a while though to sell the remaining comps.  But we are known for OUR benefit comps.  You may or may not be interested, but its worth checking out at the above link.  I'm tired so more on this label stuff later.   *** reviews for this cd were split, people who liked it loved it, and people who didnt, didnt.  But we got good feedback and for the most part, Im proud as one can be.    P.S.  Im track #15",female,25,indUnk,Gemini,1

In the garden, In her arms , you awoke. You don't think she exists, do you? I want to be at the bottom of a river  that you could see yourself drowning in. Skin enveloped in hushed rushes. Of liquored lips, in the hottest of your August suns. Of parched lips in careful submission  towards quenching the thirst in your mouth.  Bright Eyes - Brilliant and Brown - Wondering over peach hued deserts in pain and pleasure. Still searching in the depths of your disconnection from people and places.  Bitter heart of brutal circumstance; Where is your smile? Such a classic smile, your laugh is a priceless portrait; I don't think you knew that.  My American Beauty... You remind me of the sweetest Spring that I've never had the pleasure of dreaming. Lay in a daze between soft fragrant Hyacinth and Lilac. Every intoxicating breath of moonlight blue shades a beautiful hue over your desolate face. Bringing back a warmth you had once known, maybe in a first kiss somewhere.  You don't think she sees, My American Beauty, Past her own eyes, to look in to yours.  My American Beauty, I couldn't sleep till I put you down on paper.  ______________________________________________________________  -For CBFTW-  Italicized taken from poem years before by said dedicatee (WTF).  Please note that W.T.F. is not CB of CBftw, coicidentally, the persons initials are the same letters.)  This post is about how easy it is to love a person, even if they are strangers.  Since I've found this blog world, I've been meeting and communicating with so many wonderful people (see links, I will also be adding more, I just haven't had the time yet)and I'm thankful.  This is also very true of my experieinces of being a touring musician. That being said, this poem was written on post today for  CBftw  (See,  Soldier, Soldier Everywhere  1st post w/ link to his site as well as side bar "" playgroups "").Although this does not necessarily apply to him, I've been thinking about it again, and it is somewhat appropriate.  I pray he will never feel this disconnection when he gets home.   SO here's to all the lovely people I have met since posting!  The universe carries us all to make these connections and to love one another as brother and sister, so that we may live in a better world, and in a loving world for our children to grow in.  P.s.  I've also posted one more comment in Soldier, Soldier everywhere, which was copied off of a link on CB's cite.  Please check it out, and feel free to post other comments in other places, too.

354826,3949634,2004-07-25,"ALLIE - My Identical Twin  urlLink     urlLink                Ok, so this another thing I cant quite escape.  Her.  She has been following me around everywhere for the last 25 years.  Well, almost everywhere.  Allison, I call her Allie, is my identical twin sister.  Baby A, and you guessed right, I'm baby B.  Named in chronological and alphabetical order.  We are exactly 1 minute apart in age.  We were born in the month of June, 2 months early and premature, so by this happening, we are GEMINI's, as opposed to Leo's.  She will also agree that although she is a minute older, that I am the older one.  No arguing there.  She is my best friend and she pisses me off more than most people.  But, I LOVE HER.  To the very depths that I cant even feel.  We are soul mates.  And when one asks what its like to be a twin, we say, we don't know what its like NOT to be a twin.  Besides the fact that I'm married and have a child and she's not, that I'm a stay at home mom and she's not, and my domain is music, hers is not, everything is the same, everything.  You might say, ""Wow, what the hell do you mean everything is the same!?""               She is a glorified all round 6 or 7 year college student (junior).  She is so damn intelligent, but too stupid to see that she is not cut out for school right now. hehe, just kidding.  She really does try and multi task.  She has switched her major from zoology, to kineseology, and I think she is or has switched again or switched previously in between all that -ology crap.  Allie has many interests, and most of that has been spent on athletics.  She is a hard core athlete in the sense that she loves working out at the gym and she loves playing Hockey.  Trying to work and go to school and be bionic woman, has made it so that she still lives at home and is still going to school.  Her goal is still to make it to the Olympics as a Hockey player.  She is damn good, and if she ever blogs, you could possibly check out her resume' if it is included.  Her profile lists in her interests, I kid you not, 5 different ways to say she works out, and I quote ""ice hockey, lifting weights, fitness, gymnastics, athletics, dance.""  Wait, that's 6.  So you get the point, she has focused on the physical, while I have focused on the emotional.  I sing and write songs, play guitar, piano, and drums.  I was a musician in a few different bands for almost 10 years, and still continue now.  I started a record label, she became a personal trainer.  I went to community college got an AA degree in general studies, and, well, Allie...She's still going to school as previously mentioned.           With all this difference, your still asking where is the common ground?  Well, our major differences, are each others minors so to speak.  Any day we could decide to live each others lives, switch and be equally good at what the other does.  If that makes sense. I work out 3-4 times a week, am still a good gymnast (we use to be acrobats, and paired in acrobatic routines), I can play ice hockey blindfolded, although, I've only been on the ice a couple of times to play...Ok, well not blindfolded, but I can skate as well as someone whose been on the ice for years.  Allie, on the other hand, writes music on the piano and pick up most any instrument and make it sound like she knows what she is doing, and yes she can sing, very nicely in her own style, which varies a little from mine.  We both have the same subject interests in EVERYTHING you can imagine.  We have a ""lust for life"", as Iggy Pop once said.  WE both love to dance and have started working on dancing together (I can groove, but she can actually claim to have taken classes in her 6 year jaunt at school).  Our past is the same and extensive, but as we grew into teenagers we split paths, but finding we are meeting up again, and happily.  If she ends, I do to.  She wants to get a unique tattoo, where we both would match essentially juxtapose.  But my husband keeps urging me not to, well because to him its simply vanity and very trendy.  However, we are twins and a symbol between us, is a symbol between us, I guess in a way saying that we belong to each other and that there is another half that makes this one whole.  I personally believe that tattoos that have a very symbolic meaning for someone and is unique to that person is just a part of something that is physically inscribed in them and I don't mind.  (I actually have this perspective with decorating a home, i.e. putting up pictures and decorations that look nice, but, well, just aren't you. - I've seen so many tattoos that if I were certain people, I would regret - hopping on the trend for attention that has nothing to do with you, or your beliefs, just like putting on bumper stickers of your so called favorite president elect, only to know that in 4 years you might have to take that shit off, or look like a dumb ass, especially if that president elect didn't win that year.) Anyway, I digress...as usual...Where was I... Allie and I...              We use to spend so much time growing up trying to become individuals, and separate from each other, that we took each other for granted.  But now, we want to look like each other, dance like each other, play music like each other, and do whatever it is we decide in life, to do it together.  Because dammit, we'd be the best success story in the history of the world.  Ok, so I'm exaggerating, but what I mean is, wherever we end up, its got to be together.  We are a balance of each other, of nature, of life.  Ying and Yang.  We are one.  Came from the same egg and everything, which is severely different that fraternal twins, 2 eggs, 2 sperm.  But Allie and I, we have match for match, 100% the same genes.  If you ask of one of my favorite movies, I will say ""Dead Ringers.""  This is about identical twins and the deep psychology and intertwinedness of two people who cant live without the other.            If you ask her what one of her favorite books are, she will tell you, ""This Much I know is True"", which is, coincidentally, the same as me, and is coincidentally about Identical TWINS in North East Connecticut.  On this note, I should probably tell you something else.          My husband is an identical twin.  And yes, to get it out of the way, Allie, dated his twin.  So weird and strange as this sounds, it happens I guess.  Anyway, no, they are not together anymore, live too far a part and well, things just sent them to different places, I guess.  But my husband, and his twin, are 8 years older.  Grew up in North East Connecticut (yes, just like the book mentioned previously).  But they were born in Baltimore, which is also where, you guessed, Allie and I were born.  Not the same hospitals, but they were right around the corner from each other, basically.  TO make things even more strange, My husband and I share their parents name respectively, his mom  a Bonnie, and his dad, well they share the same name.  His mother was also a twin, her other half died in womb. Learning more about these coincidence, my husband and I grew up in two completely different places with two completely different lives.  However, both our grandads on our fathers side, were both Navy Chiefs in WWII.  As it thickens they were stationed in to different places, but my grandparents were married in the same New England town that my husband grew up in, and my grandparents weren't from Connecticut, they were from New York and Jersey.  I didn't find this out till after my husband and I were married.  The coincidences keep unraveling, but I'm starting to see double typing all this and its exhausting...  I will probably add more on this post later because I want to keep this for Campbell's record.   Oh, yeah, so I guess that might answer another question.

354827,3949634,2004-07-22,"One cry, and I stumble from bed, cow-heavy and floral In my Victorian night-gown.  -   ""Morning Song""  -  Sylvia Plath    I'm a nursing momma.  My daughter is almost 2 1/2 years old, and she still nurses.  If you are hearing this and are offended, well I'm sorry you haven't the depth of understanding of what this means.  So let me clarify, ""Campbell"" (name changed to protect the innocent), is not holding on to my nipple for dear life and nourishment.  I think most people suspect, when they hear me say that she nurses, that Campbell, is soley nourished through mothers milk (and unhealthily dependent).         Nursing is much more like a snack between meals at this age.  But even this has faded.  Its more for an emotional bond with mommy, and a sleep aid at this point.  She ""nurses"" in the day for mommy time, and nurses at night for a pacifier.  Most people would never have a clue of this, unless I told them or felt they were ""safe"" enough to nurse Campbell in front of.  Occasionally there is the public milkdown...er, Was that a Freudian slip or what?... MeltDowns (Sorry folks, it came out as I was typing)....Where Campbell will be grabbing at my breast for dear life like someone on fire looking for water.  ""I want some milky"" she will say.  Sometimes screaming or crying for this mommy time, in places where I don't feel comfortable.  Sometimes when I'm holding her or carrying her, she will try to slip her hand down my shirt and literally grab my breast and try to pull it up for nursing.  This is very comical.  And sometimes, she will just place her hand on my breast, down my shirt for comfort.            What is so funny is that many women in my family and some friends, have been grabbed for some ""Milky.""  I simply had to explain to Campbell, that when they are mommies they will have milk, too.  She laughs and giggles about it, but she doesn't quite understand yet.  She will still try ever so often to latch on to her Aunt Allie during bath time.  Aunt Allie is my twin.          To explain night nursing, that's another thing.  Campbell is so dependent on nursing to sleep, that ever since she was born, I have not had one wink over three hours continuously.  Well, except for recently, after her first waking she will sleep a longer period of time.  However, she wakes up an hour 1/2 to 2 1/2 hours to have ""milky"" after first putting her down, then she might sleep for 3 hours tops, followed by the hour 1/2 to 2 hours before she wakes up, where she will remain latched on till waking.  Let me explain why, whenever she awakens, its during a light awakening.  Babies and Tots spend more time in light sleep because their brains are developing, if they were to spend just as much time in deep sleep as adults their growth would be minimal compared to their growth in the first three years.  Along with brain development, much time for babes and tots is spent in light sleep soley for the purpose of survival.  Its amazing to think that the will to survive is embedded so deep within our cells, that its not something we even need to think about.  Truly amazing, being all that babies have when they are fist born are uncontrolled movement and unintelligible vocals.  Their sheer will to survive is beyond any concept that they could ever fathom.         When Campbell was born, she cried much and barely slept.  She was very alert and seemed to be taking so much in that in overwhelmed her.  Many times though, I stressed over the fact that something could be wrong, in the sense that I was projecting that she was never happy.  Or, that I ruined her in womb.  Instead of seeing this as a spirited child, which she truly is and happy at that, I thought there was nothing I could do.  So when it was time for sleep, I nursed her.  This seemed the only thing I could do to get her to sleep.  This was good and bad.  Good, because we both could get some sleep, but bad because it only lasted a very short hour - hour 1/2 before I would have to nurse her back to sleep and usually stay in the same position with my breast in her mouth so that she would stay asleep.  Now, time has passed by and the sleeping stretches are longer, but I'm still not getting enough sleep to be completely rested.  I've trained my baby to depend on my breast for sleep. However, this in no way has made her dependent on me for much else.  She is securely attached, enough to be without me and be with other people.  She is very independent.  People think nursing conceives a needy child.   Quite the opposite is true, the more you let go and give in to their needing you, the sooner they will always trust you to be there, the sooner they will want the hell to get away from you  :)  Seriously, nothing else would do for her - No pacie, no animal, blanket, or anything, just me.  I'm her lovey.          I also realize that time presents itself for everything when all parties are willing to concede.  This is the time.  I know I can now set a boundary, so that I may get more sleep, and so will she, but still be there for her to comfort, hug, kiss, sing, etc (we co-sleep).  I know now that as long as I am ""there"" for her, allowing her to have her feelings with me, she is safe, cared for, and loved.  She will understand her importance is equal to mine, that my sanity and good mothering is enhanced with sleep.  She is the Center of the Universe, but not the only one in it.   I start tonight.  We have talked for a week or so about it, how when we first laydown to go nite nite that she may have ""milky,"" but when she wakes up anytime after in the night, we will not have it.  But when she sees daylight, she may have milky again.  Cold Turkey is not a good idea.  I've been nursing her way to long to be cruel and stop all at once, plus I want to avoid Mastistitis (sp).  That's breast engorgement.  Very painful.  So each day I will do this until she eventually sleeps althroughout the night, without my help.  Then that should create a domino effect for nursing overall.  So Wish me best wishes!  Here goes for a new chapter for us both.  P.s.  I will be adding links soon under the pseudo and appropriately titled ""Playgroups"" - these will be the blogs that inspire me, and interest me, the place where this mommy can go to have a sense of community.     P.s.s  More blogs to come on:  TWINS, PUNK ROCK MOMMIES, SIX DEGREES OF SEPARATION, Exotic Fever,  Campbell stories and lessons I learned from her, and more, something about death, (its something that you think about often once you have children, and let me rephrase, the fear of...When you are young).

Best audience, in this band, was at our Galaxy Hut show. Everyone got involved and that was really fun.   JIMMY: I live alone. Our best crowd was the one at Black Cat because there were so many people who had never seen us and who were actually shocked, as opposed to the kids who are used to us by now. It was fun to watch them go, ""Whoa! This shit is nuts!""    BO: Best audience, I'd have to say, was at Catholic U. Or that's where I had the most fun playing, and then the Black Cat show. So it looks as though out of the four or five shows we've played, all of them have been our best audience.    HUTTO: I hate brown crickets. I lived in this dump where the bathroom was also the shower. There was a shower head coming out of the wall by the door and a drain in the floor under the sink.

Explain your band name and define your sound.    CLARK: I still don't know what our band name means. Ask Jimmy, he came up with it. Our sound is really low-key and not really thought out. We start to play, find a flavor, and just go.   JIMMY: Dude, the name was all Hutto. I was pushing for Chickenhawks UK. Our sound is, umm, Swamp-Rock.    CLARK: Oh, I thought it was you...    BO: Chickenhawks UK? Thank God the name was all Hutto. Jimmy, do we even play in the same band?    HUTTO: In Arkansas, the highlight of many a youngster's year is when the monster trucks come to Barton Coliseum in Little Rock. Halftime entertainment during this exhaust spectacular is Motorcycle Wars! This is when there's no less than 70 motorcycles jumping and flying all over the goddamn place. It'll set you free.     What clothes do you like to wear on stage and what do you eat on the road?   CLARK: I'm not answering, my mom could be reading this...   JIMMY: Layers, so that I can shed them as I get warmer. I eat fried food on the road. Actually, I eat fried food everywhere.    BO: Christmas Lights. Nothing else. I haven't done that yet, but I think I will get Clark or Jimmy to do that, and I'll take the Hunters (tiger-striped underwear that Clark favors live)...don't worry, Clark, I won't tell your mom about you and your (Aussie accent) ""This is the world's most deadliest snake and I'm going to stick my head in its mouth"" drawers.    HUTTO: My fashion theme as a rock star is a garage worker who happens to play guitar. Just like Elvis did in so many excellent movies. I feel our blue-collar crowd can really relate to that. My mom taught me that carrots are an excellent snackable road food that's fun and nutritious.     What are your influences and worst equipment experience?   CLARK: I smacked myself square in the forehead with the microphone once at a show. I had mic-grill marks for three days...    JIMMY: I tore my right hand open on my bass and bled through the whole show. It was actually kinda cool. Oh, once I blew our old head during our first song and had to play our whole set through a practice amp.    urlLink    Jimmy  urlLink      BO: I wouldn't exactly call it worst equipment experience, but usually every show, I develop a bruise on my thigh the size of a football from my snare hand beating down on it. Its hard to walk after that.    HUTTO: All instrument cords are the root of evil. They love to tangle and mate and get all spaghettilike around my neck and arms and legs. Geez. Then I get all mad and the room gets hot, 'cause I'm tripping and knocking everything over.   Tony Robbins is a powerful influence. He is my financial advisor and golf buddy.     What's your favorite tour memory and worst band squabble?   CLARK: We tour in May(?). Jimmy and Bonnie got into it once before a show. It was really funny. We generally never fight.   JIMMY: I love Bonnie and she loves me.    BO: It was me against the three of them. I wanted to set my drums on the ground stage instead of the riser (it's scary up there without my crew). Well, it wasn't really like a band squabble, nor was it like all of them against me, either, but it was a disagreementâthat we resolved and I won. :) Well, we all won. I would have been a wreck if I stayed up thereâthen the squabble really would have been on.    JIMMY: I think Clark was talking about my obsessive need to be on time for everything, Bo.    HUTTO: Wow, my favorite tour memory was when me and the family were touring San Diego in '79 and I stood before the Pacific Ocean on Dog Beach. The seagulls above the white-caps rose to a great height and then formed a perfect circle in flight. I had no idea I was walking on water as the seagulls harmonized in unison their strange beautiful song. I awoke in Anaheim a day later during a frightening ride through the Hall of Presidents in Disneyland. I'll never forget Lincoln. I hear Aerosmith was going through some bad times in those days, too.     What's your transpo and what's the worst place you've ever dropped trou?   CLARK: Jason's pick-up truck gets us to the shows. When is it ever not a good time to drop them drawers.   JIMMY: Hutto's truck, my Escort. Once I went potty in the worst pay toilet in Scotland.    BO: Jason's truck. I hate public restrooms, altogether. They are the worst.    HUTTO: We all agree again. I also like to pinch a loaf in my truck. I had no idea you other guys did, too.     What's the stupidest move your singer ever pulled?    CLARK: This should be interesting...   JIMMY: Well, he once jumped in the fountain at Clarendon Park during our third-to-last song, and then realized after he was soaking wet that we had two more numbers to go. OOPS!   CLARK: It's not like it was planned. But, yes, we did have two more songs...and it was really cold.    BO:  God, there's so many of them. :) Well, there was the time when Clark did some ballerina move into my kit and my set went everywhere, including the kick pedal that got contorted and completely broke right out of its holder. (Clark, you owe me, biatch.) Anyway, he did the ballerina move just about every show and screwed something up each time. I just laugh. It's more stupid than funny haha. Haha.     There was also a classic move at the Black Cat show, when Clark was trying to be all slick with the mic, and he took himself right out in the center of his forehead...the mic grill marks were funny. At the Catholic U show, Clark's dumb ass crawled out of the window behind us while we were playing (I do believe we have a picture), and one of the Dead Teenagers locked it right before he was coming back in and he was stuck out there for a minute or so. That was pretty funny, too. On that note, I love my boys; got me laughing all the time.   JIMMY: Hey, can I thank God for our continued success somewhere?   [Ed: No.]   HUTTO: I think when Clark tried going solo back in '98 backed by former members of Mr. Big. We all knew he was trying to wrap his pain in glory, but all he did was was wrap his pain in half-filled halls and lousy drum solos. Now that he's back with the band that made him a star, I've never seen him happier. I feel like now we are at the top of our game. We have become one badass rock machine fueled by the love of our fans and the respect that we have for our each other and...ourselves",female,25,indUnk,Gemini,1

354830,3949634,2004-07-18,"Well, I just set up this thing...And I have nothing to say right now.  I've spent years having a clue about computers, but literally this took me awhile.  Not because I didn't get it, but trying to chase after a little one while setting up is like watching a pingpong game.  And sometimes it was almost like trying to solve a puzzle, how I got a picture to post for this new post, but no picture in my profile, and that took me quite a while to figure.  Anyway, I was inspired to do this blog by one other fellow blogger, whose entries were so fantastic.  This guy is an excellent writer.  He is soldiering in Iraq, and it has been like reading a letter from a good friend.  apolitical,  just pure human experience.  This guy writes alot like my husband (who has been working on his novel for over five years).  However, my husband was a combat veteran of the first gulf war, so it was somewhat like reading his experiences.  God, they all have these twisted, demented but hilarious stories...I mean in the way that they are explained.  Anyway, here's the other guys BLOG  ""My War Fear and Loathing in Iraq""     urlLink http://www.cbftw.blogspot.com/   I'm so tired, I don't feel like writing, nor am I giving this guy the proper credit due, see for yourself.  Interesting,  a soldier that likes punk rock.

354832,3949634,2004-08-11,"I love my grandfather...But really only because he is blood.  If it weren't for him and a mix of other things, I would not be here.  And I love my dad.  This, obviously is my father's father.  They, G-ma & G-pa S, have lived in Florida (the retirement state) for almost all their lives now.  So growing up in MD, we did not see them much. This is where they were originally from, but I guess when you get older the whether gets colder.   So we (my sibs and I) have known them from vacations every year to the sunshine state.  We would have such a good time relaxing, swimming, lots of soda, ice cream and most importantly, because the lack of in our house growing up, delicious home cooked meals.  We loved our grandparents, they were good to us, and we were very affectionate with them, said ""I love you""...But we mostly were off on our own.  Whenever we were around though, our grandfather would lovingly tell us about the first day of our lives, when he held us.  My twin sister and I would fit very snuggly in each arm. He would then stretch his arm out and point with his finger of the opposite  hand, ""Your head would be here, and your feet ended before they touched the crevice of my arm.""  I was 4 lbs 9 oz, and Allie was 3lbs 9 oz.  14 inches long, and 12 inches long, respectively.  We were tiny.  We would hear this every visit, but in my grandfathers words we'd hear the love and pride in his voice of his first grandchildren, along with a quite cute picture of Allie and I in 24 pack Michelob box as little babes (this was only for the sake of showing how small we really where, no alcoholics here, at least not on this side).    Over the last several years, we would hear this story once or twice within a couple hours.  Every visit.  That wasn't the only story - among several.  The worst one to hear was how my grandfather, when first getting back from his tour in World WarII, came home to my grandmother smoking a cigarette.  He then picked up her pack of cigarettes, tossed them out the window and said, ""If I catch you smoking any more of these, I'm gonna throw you out the window.""  My grandfather loves his wife and he would tell this story in front of her.  Granted this incident happened over 60 or so years ago -It never ceases to amaze me: he still never lost the suaveness of being such a chauvinist.  'What an Ass,' I would say to myself.  But I loved him still, all the while feeling sorry for my grandmother.   Fast forward 5 or 6 years to now.  My grandparents are both visiting my family in Maryland.  Here lives both parents, twin sis, younger brother and younger sis.  I am visiting with Campbell while husband is in Connecticut. He stopped by here last night on the way home, so he only slightly added to the three ring circus.  Think of Wagner's  Ride of the Valkyries   or anything by Wagner playing, this is what it seems like here.  My parents are working on getting my grandparents a new place to live.  With the rate of deterioration of my grandfathers brain and the fact that no one is in Florida to help them - everyone (parents and g-parents) thought it best to move them up here and into an assisted living community.  Pretty much a place where they can have autonomy, but also have the health care needed, and be not far from family.  It has taken months and still a little time now trying to convince my grandfather, that he is not going to a ""Hospital.""  Every day is a reminder about the forgotten conversation held the day before, where after a couple of hours it seemed to ""Sink in"" that he understood.  Only to start over again the following day.  Much yelling out of frustration, crying by my grandfather about the loss of his memory and everyone trying to convince grandpa that he just no longer has much control over things.  Its so hard to see what is really just an 83 year old man, and what is Alzheimer's.  The worst part about all of this, aside from convincing him to relinquish more control to others for the sake of his well being, is the comments about things here.  Particularly, his grandchildrens friends.    My younger brother and sis, have a very good mix of friends from Trinidad, Guiana,  as well as a handful of white and black kids, Hispanic, and Asian - some American born, some not.  My parents home has been a home for all of our friends - my mom has been the mother in a way to all these different kids.  Me and my sis Allie have also had so many friends that varied race, and ethnic background, culture. You get the point.  Everyone is welcome here, and my mom loved them and would often help too much to the point of enabling.  But our home was a melting pot, free of any bs.  As long as people were good to one another, they were allowed to be here.  So people are here, friends of my sibs as well as friends of mine.  But my grandfather will come up to each one of us, and comment in various points of the day about the people who are here till sometimes three in the morning, or comment about how they are going to steal stuff, or about if one of the girls sleeps with one of these guys, the baby will be ugly. Etc, etc...The funny thing is my grandfathers opinions are not only stupid, they are ignorant.  He thinks everyone with darker skin is ""black.""  As if they have no other identity, race, culture, etc..  Its annoying to listen to him, and even more of a pointless frustration to try and tell him,  ""No one is having sex!"", ""The world we live in today, the opposite sex can still hang out together and just be friends"", ""These are people, grandpa, people who we know!"" ""these are human beings, no different or better or worse than the rest of us, and on and on.  After awhile, it as if he knows the things he says are wrong or hurtful, and begins to feel bad.  He apologizes for being messed up in the head.  Again I don't know how much of this is him and how much is the head disease.    But I've heard the worst comes out in people.  Maybe not in all, but I've heard more than not, that Alzheimer's can be a living hell.  And Its embarrassing and I just don't want to be around him and cant wait till he leaves.  My grandmother is fine for the most part - and just says, ""ignore him, that's what I do.""  I think whatever state my grandfather is in, it almost reverts him back to another time, as he would say, ""when I grew up,..."" There was segregation, it was women (and only women) that were considered promiscuous (if they hung around the opposite sex and were not dating, they were sleeping around), ...""I cant do nothin no more"", or ""I use to have hundreds of men under me as a Navy Chief, and at NIH...Now I cant do anything.""    I don't know if I'm giving a complete picture of him, but my grandfather is not able to come to terms that he is not capable of physically doing much because of age and his disease.  This is something that is argued about so often.  I feel bad.  My grandparents have nothing to do, but sit around and do nothing.  My grandfather takes several naps a day.  It is truly unfortunate that they have nothing that seems to bring them joy.  No hobbies, no friends, nothing but the stillness of time passing without you.        So they are going on Friday to check this Assisted living place.  I hope they are going to live in this place.  They can get the help they need and hopefully be able to make friends and have things to do.  I think part of the problem of many things with my grandparents, is that they have been isolated...From many things that stopped any growth in many areas that could have improved their lives.     Not to mention the sooner they get in, the sooner they are out of my parents house, which is stressing everyone out.  Including me and I don't live here anymore.  I'm all the sudden apart of everything that is wrong with my sibs friends, as if I have anything to do with what goes on here.  My ex boyfriend and his wife where here with a couple of other friends the other day, and my grandfather completely went back into his ""anger/disappointed mode"" about who we all hang with.   Not seeming to realize that I have my own family in another state, and I'm married, and so is my exboyfriend, who I'm am wonderfully good friends and his awesome wife.  My grandfather is ""Blurring"" my twin sis, my self and my younger sister together, as if he is talking to the same person about the same problem.  I'm like ""grandpa, I'm Bonnie, remember I have a husband and a daughter, I dont live here.""  This is giving me a headache writing this, but this is on my mind and its making me feel crazy.   So maybe all of this doesnt make sense right now, but im not seeming to have the space to focus on this completely. so whatever...hope thi smakes sense on some level",female,25,indUnk,Gemini,1
354833,3949634,2004-08-07,"Such a pretty blossom, only lasts for about a couple hours at most maybe, before it starts to wilt and die.  The fragrance of this flower is delicious, very deep, but subtle.  Reminds me of my dear friend Amanda's perfume.  The perfume was called McLintock.  I think.  I could be wrong.  This is a memory from high school when myself and another best friend pretty much lived at her house. This scent reminds me of that time, of carefree nonsense.  The plant continues to grow, but the bloom passes very quickly.  I got home from the store with Campbell, when I noticed the neighbors, all 4 of them, just staring at the ground all huddled together on their front step like they were watching a worm die in the evening sun.  It wasn't a worm though, it was a Moon flower plant that they moved to a new location so that it could get more sun.  Apparently, it looked much healthier when in more sunlight, than in not. But it will only bloom in the evening, then fold back up to its immediate ending with a kiss from the morning sun.    There was one lonesome bloom, a beautiful long, white bud that untwines itself as it opens.  When Campbell and I went over to have a look, we just stared for about 10 minutes.  There was a ruler placed under this bloom so that you could watch the measurement of it widen as it blossomed.  You didn't need a ruler though.  It's petals were clearly, and visibly moving.  Like one of those Disney/TLC shows that recorded a flowers growth on a camera in a matter of days, but when they post it to a program, you watch a bloom unfold, or fold back up in a matter of 30 seconds.  That was this flower, but in real time.    Standing back a good 4 or 5 feet, you could watch this flower, in all its splendor, twitch, vibrate, and shake a little as it opened its face to the world.  This was unreal, I stood in awe.  This was just a flower before I watched, but was a living thing that spoke to me as I stood there.  I wanted to say, ""Thank you, gorgeous Moon Flower.""  And then, I realized, that might sound a little silly, and the neighbors might look at me like I'm wierd. (more about that later).   But when watching this, it had something to say to me.  At least, this is the way in which God speaks to me.",female,25,indUnk,Gemini,1
354834,3949634,2004-08-05,"Its so funny how now that I am a mom I just can't listen to all the heavy and harder stuff I use to listen to.  Especially, when Campbell is listening.  Here's a list of some thing we can, right off the top of my head.   1.   Beach Boys   - Pet Sounds  2.   Elizabeth Mitchell's (of Ida)  solo album - You are my Sunshine 3.  Any album from  U2  4.  Any song from  Sara Harmer  5.   The Be Good Tanya's  - Blue Horse 6.  Any song from  Jolie Holland  7.  Anything from  Cold Play  8.   Cat Power's  - You are free 9.  Most anything from  Aimme Mann  10. Any of the following: Blues, Jazz, Classical (any period), Swing, Bluegrass, some funk, various instrumental, almost any soundtrack I own, and some hiphop (mostly Outkast).  I could be missing some, and this could also change.  That's motherhood.  Presently though, the most music we listen to together is in the car, about 45 various mix tapes, but mostly the VA Tech Radio station which is excellent, and that is a good mix of various punk, indie rock, jazz, funk, folk, hiphop, electronic, random stuff, etc. - The list that most College Stations have, but this is truly a great radio station.  I'll re-edit if I think of more.    My husband on the other hand, will put on 1.  Tom Petty (This I don't mind) 2.  Metallica (This sounds just scary to me if I was a little girl) 3.  U2 4.  Lynyrd  Skynyrd 5.  Led Zeppelin (I do Love Led Zeppelin though, just not always so listenable with your daughter) 6.  Alice in Chains 7.  Smashing Pumpkins 8.  Foo Fighters 9.  Random from Aerosmith, Pearl Jam, Pink Floyd, Chevelle, REM, Elizabeth Mitchell.  Sometimes I say, ""Do you have to play this stuff?"", followed by ""It just sounds so dark and negative and a downer on the psyche, ya know""   I will clarify though, that this is what he mostly listens to when working out (with the exception of Elizabeth Mitchell.)  His response ""Whatever, Campbell likes it.""  'Yeah, right' I think to myself, just like I like to bang my head against the wall, and run a hot iron over my foot.  Anyway, who knows, she might like it.  I just know the feeling I get when I hear certain things.  I just want to hold my hands over her ears.  Tangent...Speaking of holding hands over ears.

Entitled because this is what I think ""The Movie"" of this story would be appropriately titled.  (To be honest, the movie  Butterfly Effect  was cheesy, but interesting nonetheless about the whole scheme of life.  And so it goes, as redundent as it may seem for those of you who saw the movie.  This theory has been around long way before the movie.) According to the Chaos theory, pressented was a question: ""Predictability: Does the Flap of a Butterfly's Wings in Brazil set off a Tornado in Texas?"" so on that note... Here is her post:  His War: Our Soldier     FOX NEWS: ANCHOR-We are getting reports of a car bomb that has gone off in Baghdad âtentative reports say it may be in front of a Christian Churchâ¦wait we are getting the first pictures. The smoke looks very black, can this really be a car bomb or was a fuel station hit?  REPORTER-No, this is a car bomb âthey have gotten very good at making them out here.  ME: Thatâs was CB said the other day.  HUSBAND: Yeah, I know.  SISTER: Who is CB?  ME: Heâs our soldierâ¦    Mine, justroseâs, ~Jen~âs, 91Ghostâs, EXFBonnieâs, ThisWeâllDefendâs (the list is endless)â¦.he has become âour soldierâ, and many of us are here because we started reading his site and ours evolved from there.   Fox News: Anchor:We are also getting reports there was a bomb in Mosulâ¦    My heart sinksâ¦I will be checking every hour to see if CB posted now. How did this stranger become such an important part of my life? I have been thinking about this all day as I fretted over the fact that he has yet to post at 10pm EST. What if something happened to him? How will we know? Do his parents know about the site? His wife?   No matter what our politics of origin, those of us who flock to his site -(for the most part) leave them behind there. It is a sanctuary from the vitriol. There we donât care so much if itâs Bush or Kerry âwe only care to know that heâs OK and that he continues to feed our addiction to war-real-time. Maybe somewhere deep down we all feel guilty (stateside guilt I always say)â¦if we read each and every day we are involved âinvested even.    JUSTICE: Mom, I want to see what CB looks like.  ME: You canât, he canât put his picture up.  JUSTICE: You have yours there.  ME: I am not at war.    Sometimes I feel like we are all being selfish âmaybe not consciously, but selfish none-the-less. We want confirmation to validate our point of viewâ¦ âSee he says that he is mad at Bush for stop-lossâ¦â âNo see, he said that he thinks it would be a slap in the face to vote for Kerryâ¦â and so on...   I notice reading the posts that many try to slip in their views --scantily veiled in âconcernââ¦âCB, I am undecided, but vote Kerry so maybe you can home quicker.â In some small way maybe we all want him to justify all that we have said-- for or against the war.    ME: Dad, have you read the soldier blog that is linked to my site yet?  DAD: It takes me long enough to read everything on yours.  ME: Read his instead then, you will love itâ¦read his. Ya know what he said the worst pick up line in Iraq is?  DAD: What?  ME: Are you a terrorist, cause you da bombâ¦.    Here is a person that I have never metâ¦a person who has no first nameâ¦no faceâ¦yet a friend. His words have become so familiar âso anticipated. He seems to be the embodiment of all that is good in this country. A heroâ¦.yet he is often blunt, disgruntledâ¦and human. A visitor to his site once pointed out that the âhawksâ were overlooking glaring signs that say, âAnti-warâ âthe painting choice, the link to Hunter Thompsonâ¦but I think thatâs what I find so wonderful. He seems mad about the war sometimes âyet the next day touched by a gesture from a local. He listens to SOD, but reads Hunter Thompson. He comes from a republican family âyet contemplates a vote for Nader.   ME: Do you think more than one person writes CBâs page?  JUSTROSE: Why?  ME: Because he just doesnât make sense. Hunter Thompson said that he would rip off the heads and piss down the neck of this Nazi administrationâ¦.  JUSTROSE: No, itâs just himâ¦   I disagree with those who constantly tell him to go to school for writing/journalism. Academia will steal his edge and attempt to reign in his raw talent and passion. His writing is real and prompts many of us to respond with words of comfort and well-wishes each day.  The things that many of us say/want to say to him ââWe are proud of youâ, âStay safeâ, âThank you for what you are doingââ¦seem to ring hollow typed in the comments section of the blogâ¦but I know they are all truly from each personâs heart.  There is no figuring this soldier out âand thatâs why he is everyoneâs soldierâ¦he is our soldier.  *For anyone that hasnât read CBFTWâs site âplease do at http://cbftw.blogspot.com/",female,25,indUnk,Gemini,1

And that is why weâve decided to have our wedding vows in The Chapel of the Transfiguration, Caleruega, Batulao, Batangas. And the reception will be somewhere in Tagaytay (most probably).     I didnât exactly plan to have my wedding outside the metropolis but as Ezra have carefully conveyed her plan for my wedding; I was so excited that Iâve decided right there and then that Caleruega it is! We talked about almost everything, from the motif to the centerpieces, to the flower and plants for the chapel, the cake, the gown, the entourage, the flower girls, the place to stay, the giveaways for principal sponsors and guests, the receptionâ¦Gosh, there are so many things to do! And may I not forget the churchâs requirements (birth certificate, confirmation, counseling) Thank God for Wedding Coordinators!  Though we have not visited the place yet, and have not made any deposit or reservations, Iâd say this would definitely be itâ¦weâre schedule to make an ocular visit on Aug 14 (hope it pushes through).

Me and my friend Charles Vanover were bringing in a train of carts, it was 30 carts, and this fat lady walked over a curb and tripped. It was kinda funny but I felt kinda sorry for her. That was close to another time a fat lady fell. It was at MJR last summer and we were leaving from a movie, I don't remember what it was, and she fell going to her car that her husband or so drove up to pick her up. If you ever looked at the sidewalk near the entry before about 3 months ago there was dark pavement stuff there because the lady broke it. Well now they fixed it and it looks better now but she did break it really bad. Also at work with Scott Stoinski there was some bad carts, you know the ones that can't move right, and we had to bring them to the back of the store with other bad carts. Yea well while we were doing that we ran on the backs of them there are we threw them into the the fence. Well a cop drove up to us and was like ""why were you riding those carts"". Scott said that's were the carts go. The cop said ""was the fence bad that you needed to throw them, and you could get fired"". I was really scared just because it was a cop.

367100,3702078,2004-06-21,"i thought i'd take this opportunity to share a bit of south african history...  wednesday, the 16th, was national youth day here in south africa.  the day  celebrates june 16th, 1976, when student uprisings began in soweto. i've mentioned soweto a number of times - it's actually a group of townships  southwest of johannesburg (hence the name: SoWeTo stands for south-west  townships).  the township these days is a mix of extreme poverty and extremely  wealthy black families (winnie mandela, nelson mandela's former wife, has a  house in one of the neighborhoods), but is famous historically for its  political activism - desmond tutu and nelson mandela, for example, both grew up  there.   in any case, during the apartheid era, blacks (and coloreds, as i've mentioned  before) were confined to townships outside of the almost exclusively white  cities and forced into a 'bantu education system,' where they were made to  study in afrikaans, and in which their own history was given no regard at all. june 16th, 1976 was the beginning of the end of the educational system and  ultimately apartheid - students and young people took to the streets  demonstrating against the forced educational system and disregard for their own  culture and history.   these days anyone  visiting soweto will be taken to the hector peterson memorial/museum - a shrine  to the first casualty of the uprisings and one of the three subjects of an  internationally famous photo of him being carried by his sister and a friend to  a nearby church for help (the church, incidentally, is the one where my boss'  father preached).  peterson was the first among many killed on june 16th for  publically demonstrating against bantu education and the system of repression  practiced by the apartheid regime. the amazing thing is how fresh this history all is  here - even more so than i've experienced in israel, which still only  celebrated its 56th independence day this year.  here so much of apartheid  still lingers on in mentalities that these celebrations are fierce  demonstrations of how much things still need to change, as much as they  celebrate how much things already have and south africa's ability to make a  peaceful transition from one of the most racist political systems on earth to  one of the world's most participatory democracies.    speaking of transition/democracy/peace and justice... a few minutes after i hit 'send' on last week's email, i was called into  my 'orientation' meeting with the office director.  i should have had this  meeting last monday when i arrived, but since another intern was arriving that  morning, ivor (the office director) put it off until he was around as well.   the meeting was basically administrative, but ivor began by discussing a bit  what it means to be an american in south africa.  in particular he was talking  about the anti-americanism in this country, or rather anti-bush administration- ism.  the key point, he said, is that south africans feel that if ever an  internal war (civil war, i suppose) were justified, it was justified in south  africa - - and that south africans very very strongly feel that if they were  able to resolve such deep-rooted problems without resorting to warfare, the  rest of the world should be able to, as well. hence the nearly universal  opposition here to the war in iraq, hence strong anti-israeli feelings  (although i have to say i personally haven't felt any less comfortable  introducing myself to people as an israeli than as an american).  hey, that's what i am here for, right? to learn about how south africa has  managed to resolve some of its deep-seated problems, and take some of those  approaches and adapt them to the conflict region i'm from and conflict regions  where other methods haven't worked...and get there before the situation  disintegrates to another iraq, or another kosovo, or another haiti.    an interesting point ivor made about the anti-americanism is that south  africans right now are distinguishing between american citizens and the bush  administration...but that if bush is re-elected in november, things may change  as the perception will be that americans supported bush overall.    i was thinking about these things as i went sight-seeing in pretoria this  weekend (actually, sight-seeing was second priority to seeing the south african  musical 'sarafina,' but unfortunately my pals and i didn't buy our tickets  early enough and it sold out.  i guess even some things here don't quite fit  into the 'african time' concept...). in any case, i spent yesterday afternoon walking through historical pretoria -  in particular, the union buildings (seat of government) and church square (home  to the provincial supreme court and other various municipal buildings). i have to say i was thoroughly unimpressed with both places.  sure, the  architecture is gorgeous, and the grounds of the union buildings are immaculate  and full of flowers...but they seem to have no soul.  maybe it's because the  opulence of the union buildings and surrounding gardens stands uncomfortably  juxtaposed with the slightly seedy downtown areas right near it...but more  likely, i think, is because of what these buildings represent: a racist,  xenophobic regime whose day has long passed.  true, the union buildings are  still the seat of government (and the scene of this year's 10-year anniversary  of ""the new south africa"") and the buildings in church square are still used  for various civic functions, but their grandeur is a reminder of what south  africa used to be - nelson mandela was tried in the palace of justice, where  the supreme court now sits, and the apartheid policies were carefully designed  where mbeke now sits as president of the republic.  a statue of paul kruger -  one of the early and most vehement leaders of apartheid - still stands at the  center of church square.   so yes, i'm glad i visited - - but the splendor of the two areas is marred for  me.  i certainly don't feel a need to return (although, there is a nice little  crafts market near the union buildings...i may have to return for some gifts!)  continuing on the political note... i forgot to mention that last weekend (saturday, the 12th) the olympic torch  came through south africa - capetown, specifically. this is the first time  south africa was a site in which the torch was carried, and it was a very, very  big deal.  torch carriers and runners ranged the gamit from politicians to  political activists to celebrated atheletes and community members.  nelson  mandela held the torch on robben island, where he was imprisoned for over 20  years.  the torch was there only from about 7AM until late afternoon, but  advertisements on television for the entire week preceding demonstrated the  poignance and momentousness of this occasion - another indicator of just how  far south africa has come from its history of apartheid and isolation from  international support.   on the opposite end was political coverage of ronald reagan's funeral.  reagan  is viewed here very negatively for his interactions with the apartheid regime,  and it took a few days for thembo mbeke (south africa's president) to say  anything positive about him - despite the fact that the decision to extend  mbeke's sojourn in DC (he was there for the G8 summit) so that he could attend  the funeral was made as soon as reagan's death became public information.   overall here press coverage of the incident was definitely on the negative  side, even from the more conservative news channels.     but, enough of history and politics for now. my sojourn here so far has been  shaped by all kinds of 'south africa moments' and experiences...  just as one example: as i walked over to a nearby shopping complex saturday  morning to buy a converter a man was sitting outside singing and hoping that  passer-byes would fill his cup with change.  no different, one might say, from  street musicians anywhere in the world.  the difference was, he was singing  christmas hymns in zulu. it's an indication of how large a role religion plays  in this country - politically as well as personally as well as economically.   and a truly south african moment.      and as an update to my falling-in-love-at-first-sight experience last week:  when i left my flat yesterday to go buy some groceries, the guy selling  newspapers on the corner was there yet again...and as i passed by, he smiled  flirtatiously, said good-morning and called me by name. at first i was amazed that he remembered me - after all, despite professing his  love, he really did only see me once, for five minutes, a week before - and was  a bit angry at myself for not remembering his (romantic interest or not, i felt  i was being rude in some ways by not taking the trouble to remember it).  but  after a few minutes i realized that really, recalling what MY name is and who i  am is almost to be expected - after all, as a white person - and more  specifically, as a petite, brown-haired white woman - i certainly stand out in  my predominantly black neighborhood.   with this came the additional realization that this is the probably the first  time in my life i've lived somewhere where i am visibly in the minority.  it's  hard to realize how easy it is to take majority status for granted, even when  i'm conscious of it.   so in that sense south africa is becoming as much of a learning experience  about myself as it is about the culture, history, and traditions here...  that's it for today - - karen's monday morning (well, afternoon) philosophical  waxing.  have a wonderful summer (winter) solstice everyone - - i know i'm  looking forward to the start of longer days in this part of the world!  much love, karen",female,24,indUnk,Virgo,1

378416,1510754,2004-07-01,"Howdy Gents and sick women. Welcome to the nightmare that is    Beer 'N' Porn .  I make no apologies for what you may find here. Suffice it to say, this will be evidence of what happens when a group of your average no-nonsense type guys get together in the name of booze, cheap thrills, and intellectual conversation. This is our take on the world around us. Visit often and stay as long as you like.   Since I started this damn thing, I guess I'll go first. Hang on tight....     I remember being young (younger - 6 or so) and imagining what itâd be like to be 20-something. At that point, I considered 20-something to be fairly old. By then Iâd be able to drive, vote, drink, smoke â Iâd have my own home and Iâd probably be getting married soon to some beautiful and intelligent woman who loved me right back. Iâd be bigger and stronger. I would be a grown up. I thought about it frequently and it made me impatient. I wanted to be old enough to have responsibility but no more â I didnât want to be old. Although old age isnât exactly bearing down on me any time in the near future, it again has become the subject of my daily thoughts. Not in the same way as when I was six years old, however. These thought seem more realistic â a bit more static and convincing than the six-year-oldâs waking dreams. I wonder how itâll all turn out. Not finally (that does come to mind though) but more in the not too distant future. Who will I be with? Will it be ok by then (with me or with âeveryone elseÂ)? How will IÂ? Where will IÂ? All this echoing brought me to write this down in an effort to try and clear space in the attic.   Iâm gay. Means so much. I find it has a separate meaning for just about every individual. Oh sure some are similar in nature and concept. But somewhere along the line, personal opinion â the real and deep impressions they make on us and we make on ourselves dailyâquestions, answers, analysis of what and whyâour genuine sentimentâtrue thought uninterrupted by pressure â gets added to the mix. From that, a few definitions of gay get splintered into innumerable sub-opinions, sub-sub-opinions and offshoots of sub-opinions and so on and so on. In the end, everyone has there own personal definition and opinion of what gay is. Iâd assume itâs like that for just about every topic of thought. But my problem comes from my definition so itâs important that I put it out on the table. Try and bear with me.   What other people think of me being gay:   Iâm not a true man. Iâm not a complete and masculine man. I am more woman than a straight man. Iâm weak and girlish and like girlish things which makes me less of a man.   This hurts. It hurt to constantly battle with all of these (and many other) thoughts of what they are thinking. I checked myself daily for the limp wrist, the slurred speech, the clothes, the voice âeverything. I tried everyday to be as masculine as possible lest I slip through the cracks and become one of Them â the queers, the fags, the âladiesÂ. I tried. I deepened my voice, I watched what I wore and, most importantly, I watched very carefully what I expressed interest in. I didnât talk about antiques (not really interested in antiques in reality) or interior design (ditto) or the like. Even deeper than this, I more or less kept my distance from and did not express interest in men who fit the gay stereotypes. I tried everyday to be a âregular guyâ who just so happens to like men. I tried hard. It was maddening. I couldnât be a man and like men. My masculinity was eroded by the stereotypical image most people have of gay men â yes that includes me. I crucified myself in little moments that I caught myself doing the âwrongâ things â right down to the laugh. If I was sitting wrong (fag!) I straightened up or made it a bit more âmanlyÂ. Is that my hand swishing a little (fucking fagot!) too âsweetlyâ? Toughen it up a bit somehow. Donât wear your shirt like that, Drew. You look a like a (fag â youâre going to hell. You know that donât you? All of those speeches and pamphlets in your favor are bullshit. You arenât going to heaven. HE never intended for anyone to stay gay. Itâs like a sickness â a mental disorder â itâs a demon. God may love you but you canât be gay. Kill it off, Drew â Kill it off.) queer.   After a while of fighting that madness, things changed. The part of âStraight-gay guyâ was far too tough and, believe it or not, it was literally killing me. I couldnât keep up with my own standardsâand so I just became âDrewâ. It all happened very naturally and easily and I found that I didnât mind me so much then. What I also found was that most of the pressure to be this uber-masculine man came from myself â a fear breed into me by me and the world around me or being gay. Wow. That shook my thought tree something awful. Took me a while to realize that I played a part in my own slow torture. All this because I believed something. I believed, simply put, that I wouldnât have friends if I was gay. What a world.   What I think of me being gay   I wish I could be gay without fear. I donât mean that Iâm afraid of getting my ass kicked. Iâm STILL afraid of rejection by the people I love and respect. Iâm afraid that Iâll be the un-normal kid. Iâm even more afraid of my friends staying my friend because of some obligation to be politically correct while feeling outright disgusted at my âunnaturalâ state.   I wish it didnât matter. Thatâs all. Being gay I meanâI wish it didnât matter but it does. We, as human beings, have not grown to that point. We care. We donât really care that theyâre gay as long as they keep it somewhat lowkey. Donât kiss in public. Donât talk about your boyfriend or girlfriend like itâs âokâ and for godsakes, donât make it sound so ânormalâ! We donât want âthemâ teaching our children. We donât want them on our buses next to us. We donât want them singing and dancing or doing (god forbid it) anything in public. We donât want them to be seen. Sweep those girlish freaks under a carpet somewhere. Theyâre ok and all but they certainly arenât (acceptable) normal by any standards. One of âthem couldnât be president â not seriously. They are an oddity - a novelty. They are the trend of the 90âs and the new millenium. With any luck, our children will grow out of that phase â that movement. They will soon be returned to the basementâto hideâto practice their abominations in silence, in secret, and away from the rest of us â far, far, far (die) away.   Forgive the sermon.   Part of me believes the hype. I get a little emotional and I think to myself, âItâs because Iâm gayâ. Thatâs why this is happening to me â or thatâs why I did what I did. Almost everything I do I associate in one way or another with being gay. I sit this way because Iâm (a fag) gay. I do this or that because Iâm (queer) gay. I believe sometimes that Iâm repressing all of the girlish things that I should be doing. Sometimes I buy into it. Itâs very hard for me to be myself at times. I constantly question every move â every move. Thoughts, words, clothes â I canât begin to tell you. Yes, it makes me angry. It makes me angry that I cannot date or express interest without fear. I canât kiss in public without feeling uneasy. I wish it didnât matter to us. But it does â anyone who says differently is likely lyingâand thatâs not to say everyone is anti-gay. That IS to say that most folk give a shit one way or another.   What I think now    Being gay isn't who I am any more than being a musician is who I am. I am the sum of many things and gay just happens to be one of the ones that a lot of people seems to be riled about. Am I proud to be gay? Getting there. It's a long road and I find I take the bigger steps alone. Yet, I also find out more and more about myself along the way.    Whatâs my point?   I wanted to give you an idea of what itâs like. In some way I hope by putting myself on the line, a few lights will click on at some point and people will consider a few things that they maybe havenât before. Thatâs not to say I want this to change minds â whether you believe homosexuality is right or wrong is up to you. This is just to remind people of our (my) [their] humanity. That's something we all have in common.     Peace,      Dexter Otis Green",male,24,Internet,Aries,0

A search for logic or reason amidst the ranting will do you no good, friend, as I can assure you, here and now, that you will find very little if any in what is written here. I do, however, promise to provide a nightmarish wonderland acid mind rape ride â whisking you away to enlightenment as yet unknown by most.   First up is Gary Busey.    Bio, crime, sentence of: Gary Busey     Bio  Born June 29, 1944 (A product of his father maddening booze escapades and subsequent trips to his daughterâs room for âdaddy-touchy-timeâ) in the bustling metropolis of Goose Creek Texas, it was clear from the onset that Gary Busey was destined for stardom. Busey would begin developing his trademark disheveled appearance and splotchy hectic complexion early on by chugging moonshine with daddy at the tender age of 9 âneath a big olâ Texas sky bristling with heat.    Presumably, it is at this age that he is lost in a drunken sheep-fucking haze that would never completely subside. Rather than working to his detriment, it allowed Busey to see his way clear to breaking into show-biz with The Rubber Band, an obscure rock band in search ofâ¦ you guessed it, booze and loose women. After meeting The Doors and the Byrds and much sampling of their sweet sweet âschwag-assâ marijuana, The Rubber Band records a predictably sub-par and all together painful concept album titled, âSet a while, Pedophileâ with CBS/Epic records.   His foot now in the door, Busey ârockedâ his way into several embarrassing television appearances in the early 80âs. His pungent body order and riotous imbibing (coupled with the inevitable drunken belligerence) gave cause for many to hire him in the hopes that he would âjust go awayâ. It was then assumed that Busey was merely a privileged studio hobo who wandered from set to set. Leave it to the likes of Busey to fall short of those expectations.  Fueled by gin and a right shitty personality, Busey shambled his way into several film roles including ""Carny"" (1980) (Busey as, Vera Stemple - an abusive alcoholic bearded lady), ""Barbarosa"" (1982), ""Silver Bullet"" (1985) and ""D.C. Cab"" (1983). Still unable to get rid of Busey in the Italian sense, films makers created roles that fit Buseyâs abusive and unstable personality. Busey was set lose on the street of Los Angles with an 8-ball of coke, 2 hookers, a 1.75 of rum, and a videographor  24 hours before ""Lethal Weapon"" was filmed in 1987. The footage gleaned from the ordeal was spliced into the film â Busey never once looked at a script.   Busey's film career continued to flourish in the 90's as he starred in such movies as ""Predator 2: Gay and Unashamed"" (1990), ""Point Break"" (1991), ""Hider in House"" (1991), ""Under Siege"" (1992), ""The Firm"" (1993), ""Warriors"" and ""Drop Zone"" (both 1994) and, the film that made Christ wet, Sidney J. Furie's ""The Rage"" (1997). Busey also lends his gutter-trashed voice to the best-selling video game,  Grand Theft Auto: Vice City.  Television, film, and super rock stardom were not to be Buseyâs only claims to fame. His personal life was to be more than outstanding. After nearly dying of head injuries in a booze fueled âspiritual questâ motorcycle accident in December 1988, Busey feel madly in love and married Julie Amber-Misty Deadham â a 14-year old prostitute turned card shark. Apparently having too much love to give, Busey married and divorced an impressive 21 times. In 1971, one of his âjunky bitchâ wives gave birth at her prom in a bathroom stall. Unable to âtake out the garbageâ, she named it âJakeâ and another generation of Busey was set to take the stage. Arrested and released on bail after a fight with his 12th wife, Tina âSomethingorotherâ, Busey would learn to focus on the one true love of his lifeâ¦ whisky. He divorced Tina in June of 1998. Ass play with Jack La Lane had not been ruled out as a mitigating factor in the divorce at that time.    Crime  Birth. That's right kids - I hate him because he was born. If youâre offended by my synopsis then you too, deserve to die. Honestly, if you love Gary Busey and you know it, kill yourself.  ........Iâm not kidding.   Gary Busey's entire life is a âFrench Mistakeâ. From now on I'll equate the lowest form of things in terms of their relation to Gary Busey and Sponge Bob Square Pants. Spongebob - a fictional character, a non-person - has  a better career, sex life, and coke dealer than Gary Busey witness the approach of the apocalypse......   http://www.comedycentral.com/tv_shows/imwithbusey/   How the fuck did that come to pass?! HOW!??!?  This pretty much speaks for itself. If you need more evidence than this, please donât hesitate to let me knowâ¦ Iâll personally come right on over and disembowel your parents. This is clearly a precursor to Gary Colemanâs ""triumphant"" return to television and I, for one, will not let such an injustice stand.   Sentence  I'm keeping my fingers crossed for heroin and STD's but that may be a vain hope. To be honest, I smell suicide. The man canât even bottom feed. Heâs being followed around by an obsessive college drop out magicianâ¦. His end is nigh.    That said, thank God that my job was made easy this time. Burn in hell, Gary Busey. Burn in hell.

My plans for tonight â aside from writing this fine piece of opinionated literature for all of you fine lookinâ readers out there â involve watching the game, drinking some more beer, and probably falling asleep. Thatâs it.  My esteemed colleague Dexter Otis Green believes that, along with others in our common circle of friends, I am succumbing to the perils of adulthood. I no longer take off for uncharted waters without reason or rhyme; instead, I speak of work the next morning, or âobligationsâ that require my presence in the coming hours, days, weeks, or months. Adulthood is not a function of age or responsibility, I can hear him say â rather, adulthood is deciding that suddenly age and/or responsibilities actually matter.  Part of me agrees with Mr. Green, but another part of me canât deny that the pressures of a full-time job and the ensuing routine of days, weeks and months do weigh heavily on my poor brain. Which is why Iâm here on the couch, wasting away my Friday night on barley water and Jerry Remyâs color commentary. Know why Iâm not out causing trouble? Because Iâm tired.   Iâm 22 years old, and Iâm run down.  Friday night is the end of the work week, but itâs also one of only two nights out of seven where Iâm allowed to sleep in as late as I want. And of course thatâs assuming I donât have any work due for Monday, or any projects that need my attention, or any other reason why Iâd have to go in to work on the weekend. Why waste a perfectly good night staying out all hours when I only get this one rare chance to actually get some  rest ? My one chance to switch off my mind and not have to answer to anyone; no bosses, no co-workers, no payroll department, no bill collectors, no nothing. So alas, itâs the couch and cable for me.  The worst part? In some dismal, dejected way, I enjoy this time off.  So what would drive an otherwise well-adjusted American male in the prime of his life to spend his weekends like a middle-aged divorcee telemarketer? I blame my high school guidance counselors â and, in some small way, my college education.  I see the same thing happening to all of my high school buddies who made it though their undergraduate years. Sure, we all have jobs now, our own places; we live with some measure of independence, however illusory. But when the weekend comes, there we are, sitting at home in front of the tube with a six-pack and a dazed expression as we try to forget the pressures of the 9 to 5. And none of us are older that 24.   At first, I thought it was just the transition from the wild hedonism of college into the drudgery of the cubicle that caused us all to become professional couch potatoes. But then I look at other friends from high school who gave higher education a big olâ middle finger and got themselves a full-time job as soon as possible. Five years later theyâre pulling down good salaries, driving fast cars with their trophy girlfriends to all-night raves and generally not giving a flying fuck about their jobs or their futures. To summarize, theyâre living the life of a twentysomething â and Iâm preparing for my mid-life crisis.  But therein lies the difference between the legions of college grads sleeping the weekend away and those whoâve always been part of the workforce. As I stated so eloquently beforeâ¦.THEY DONâT GIVE A FLYING FUCK ABOUT THEIR JOBS OR THEIR FUTURES. Never did, in fact. They needed a job, so they got one. They didnât like living at home, so they moved out. They want to stay out all night, they do. If they forget to pay the rent, theyâll live somewhere else. And if they lose their job, well thereâs thousands of other ways to make a living wage, so just find something else.  Back in high school, when my buddies and I were young and impressionable concerning the ways of the world, we were force-fed the upper middle class dogma known as Bettering Yourself Through Education. College wasnât a choice â it was expected. How else could we expect to get a Decent Job, or the Required Certification, or the Bachelorâs Degree that guaranteed us Upward Mobility? It was simple, really; four years gets you a magical piece of paper that guarantees you six figures at MegaSuperCorp working two hours a week and playing golf in Bermuda on the weekends. Plus your parents pay for it all! Of course we were lining up out the doors to get into the College of Our Choice (or the Safety School, of course, if our SATs or our parentsâ tax bracket werenât up to snuff).  So what has our four years of blood, sweat, tears and debauchery yielded? Sure, we got that magical piece of paper, that Bachelorâs Degree that says the world THIS MAN KNOWS MORE ABOUT CLASSICAL LITERATURE THAN THE AVERAGE PEON. But we never asked the Devil if we could read the fine print. Sure, weâre all specialized ourselves, but we never asked if the jobs would be there. We never asked whether we would actually like the jobs anyway. And we never asked what it would mean to be locked into a single career choice at the ripe old age of 22.  So here we are, a generation of accountants and computer programmers, elementary school teachers and civil engineers, with a ball and chain called our career wrapped tightly around our collective legs. Itâs quite a debilitating feeling knowing that if our job sucks, well thatâs all she wrote, you better suck it up cause you have $80,000 worth of classes saying this is what you know how to do.  So, as my high school dropout buds jump from job to job and take whatever comes, here I am tied to my desk, doing the job that the Great American Workforce Factory has programmed me to do, forever and ever, Amen.  I lift my sixth bottle of beer to you, my friends. Hereâs to the great promise of a bright future. May it someday actually come true for all of us.   -Mr. Carson",male,24,Internet,Aries,0

378420,1510754,2004-07-01,"Requiem for a Motivation - 7/23/03    I apologize in advance for this one - it's godawful long, and isn't very uplifting - kinda like Stienbeck. But it had to be said...   Like any great philosophical insight, this one came to me out of the blue, while engrossed in any one of the trivial matters in which I spend my time. For Socrates, it was afternoon discussions and nature walks around Athens; for Aristotle, it was an everyday lecture at the Lyceum. For myself, it was Saturday night bingo at the Knights of Pythias hall in Milbridge, ME.   For those of you from the Great American Midwest, or expansive Asian countries, the Australian outback or anywhere in Canada, Maine might seem small and unimportant. For a child who grew up in Connecticut, however, where two hoursâ drive gets you anywhere in the state, Maine is an infinite expanse, a desolate stretch of back roads and unlit streets where the houses are few and far between, separated by twisted and malevolent pine forests that consume the rolling landscape like kudzu. The larger cities, like Portland and Bangor, rear out of the countryside like the manors of feudal lords, commanding the peasantry of the villages to come and work in their factories, their shipyards, their Starbucks franchises. If you are to go north of Portland, you are a farmer; if you are to go downeast of Portland, you fish. Plumbing is a luxury. Hunting is a valid source of daily food intake. It is a pioneer land seemingly out of place in our global economy, and it is the home of my soon-to-be father-in-law.   My lady loveâs great-grandmother lives in Milbridge, a town twenty minutes south of Bar Harbor (and no itâs not Bah Hahbah â a true New England accent is much more subtle than a string of idiotic hâs) whose economy is dominated completely by three trades â quilting, crabbing, and tag sale-ing. Her great aunt knits the quilts, and the homestead down the way opens every morning at 9 selling 8 oz tubs of fresh cleaned crabmeat, which combined with a little mayo and a toasted roll (butter, please, thick slabs of milk grease in a one-hundred year old cast iron pan is the way Jesus toasted his rolls, thankyouverymuch) makes the closest us mortals can come to making the Divine Ambrosia of Mount Olympus. Great-Grandma and Great-Great-Aunt live in the same town they grew up in, and keep care of the same houses that served to raise them all those years ago. Great-Grandma is in her late nineties, and doesnât seem to be much longer for this world, but like any great New Englander she is doing her best to shake her fist at the reaper and stay right where she is. I traveled with her family last weekend to pay a visit to the family, and to perhaps say our last goodbyes to the Matriarch of the family.   The Great-Great-Aunt, along with another Great-Aunt who lives close by (in Maine, seemingly everyone lives until Old Testament-ages â it must be the clean air and the crabmeat) loves to play bingo. It was a Saturday night, and my fiancÃ© and I, having finished making our rounds visiting family, had no plans as to what to do next. They invited us along, and we accepted, although the prospect of a Satuday night in the wilderness playing bingo with a handful of octogenarians seemed like a recipe for drowsiness.  When we reached the Knights of Pythias hall, however, I learned how mistaken I was. We drove for miles on US 1, with nothing but trees and the odd house popping out of the brush every mile or so. The hall, however, was packed to the gills with people. The parking lot was overflowing, and the line for the bingo cards was out the building. Where did all these people come from? I should have figured â itâs a Saturday night in Maine, and itâs bingo night. What else is there to do? Play bingo.  Iâd been to Foxwoods before, and they have a bingo hall there. Iâve never been inside, but Iâve stared through the expansive glass doors and seen thousands of retirees in a Great Hall that rivals something from the imagination of Tolkien. Monstrous bingo billboards line each wall, displaying the numbers called and the game being played like batting averages on a ballpark TeleTron. The room, however, is silent, with waitstaff silently passing cups of coffee around to the players intently surveying their cards. It never seemed to me like a place of excitement, of intrigue and suspense; it was a bingo hall, it was slow, it was quiet, it was boring.  Ah, but this was Maine, and it was bingo night. They only come out at night, you know.  Of course, there was a strong contingent of retirees there, but they were by no means the majority. There were plenty of middle-aged couples, thirtysomethings still wearing their work clothes after spending a day plowing fields; single women bearing the quiet fingertip scars of a day spent knitting clothes and bedspreads. A contingent of teenagers were working the concession stand, which didnât mess around with snacks no sir but served meatloaf dinners on satellite dish-sized plates, tuna sandwiches on monstrous rolls, and slices of lemon meringue pie that rival the greatest works of God himself. These people were not here to âwin moneyâ or âpass the timeâ â this was their social hour, their Saturday night, their celebration of a weekâs worth of hard work, and they were spending the time in the company of friends, gossip, and bingo.  A funny thing happened, however, once the games got underway. Without saying a word, the entire crowd fell dead silent the moment the bingo balls fell into the hopper. The bingo cards themselves were made of cheap newsprint, and each player (including myself) had a stack of paper cards fifteen deep, one sheet for each game to be played, six cards per sheet. Not that six was the limit; it was the minimum. Most of the intense players had three or four âgamesâ going at once, which amounted to 24 cards per game, over fifteen games, not counting the final jackpot game which you could buy separately at three cards a game. Two hundred people dead silent at the drop of a hat, ink stampers ready in one hand, feverishly watching the scoreboard at the front of the room. First game was a coverall â get every number to win.   âB7!â  The game was afoot.  Halfway through the fourth game â regular & four corners, $75 prize, second cup of coffee and considering a slice of the lemon meringue â I stopped paying close attention to the game and started watching the crowdâs reaction to each number called. At the beginning of each round, the hall was dead silent, but as more and more numbers were called you could feel a buzz growing in the room. Thoughts became whispers, conversations became more animated, and numbers were chanted softly by many like a mantra. âCome on 27, 27, 27.â After each new number a louder and louder sigh would escape the crowd, as the inevitable conclusion to the game drew closer and more and more players felt they had a shot at the illustrious prize.  And then, BANG, like a house of cards.  âN29â  âBINGO!â  A wave of despair filled the room.  The winner was a woman in her late fifties, a four-gamer with a dizzying array of stampers spread around her like candles at a shrine. An official, still wearing his back brace from his dayâs work in the field, read off the numbers on her card to the barker up front to verify that she had won. But no one else was paying attention. From the moment the first syllable left her lips, everyone in the crowd had mindlessly ripped off the last gameâs cards from their stack, tossed them aside without a second thought and primed their stampers for the next round.  But wait, I thought! Itâs not official until the card is verified! What if she mistakenly labeled an uncalled number? What if thereâs still a chance? No matter â mistakes hardly ever happen in bingo, not when thereâs nothing to distract you from the all-consuming task of finding the number â35â on a piece of paper and covering it with a blot of red ink. Itâs definetly Kindergarten stuff. And no oneâs going to fake a BINGO, now are they? Not in front of hundreds of your peers. Itâs not worth the cash.  So, without question, without verification, one hundred and ninety nine players trash their games and get ready for the next. And so it goes, from game to game to game. Save for a ten minute smoking break, this is how the next two hours go for the residents of the Knights of Pythias Hall in Milbridge on this Saturday night. Games go for about 10 to 30 minutes, and save for five minutes of suspense before the winning number is called, itâs an endless litany of call-stamp-call-stamp-BINGO-riiiiiip and begin again.   The final game â jackpot coverall â was worth over $400. Not a bad haul for a game that cost $11 to play. Before the winning number was called the room seemed to be vibrating with tension. Prayers were said. Fingers were crossed. Lemon meringue pies were consumed. It was game seven of the world series. Fourth and goal on the 1. A penalty shot in triple overtime. The home stretch. The final lap. This was the moment we were all waiting for, that chance to win it all, to be #1, to take the grand prize.  âBINGO!â  And as soon as she said the word, the hall was empty.  I sat in awed silence. One minute the hall was packed to the gills with people filled with hope and desire and longing and faith. And then it was over. No one sat down to see if the final card was valid. No one even so much as said congratulations to the lucky winner. Nothing. They threw away their cards and filed out of the exits before I so much as stamped my final card.   Gone.  And it was then, as I threw the last of my bingo cards into the trash and finished my last sip of coffee that I was struck with my Profound Philosophical Thought.   Is there any human endeavor as foolish as competition?  We had all played fifteen games, each one with a prize that we all desired. And while the eventual outcome of the game had everything to do with blind, undeserving luck, winning the prize did require beating everyone else in the room to the illustrious bingo. We were all playing for the prize, but we were staying for that possibility, that one in a million chance that the next game would be the one where we would hit big, where the numbers would fall in the right order and we would be the lucky winner.   But there we all were at the end of the day, fifteen winners and one hundred and eighty-five losers; multiple losers, to tell the truth, for we willingly sat through fifteen straight let-downs without concern. And what of the winners? The lucky ones who got the break when they needed it most? So what, I say. They were winners for all of thirty seconds, as their cards were verified and their check was presented. Then it was right back to the next game, where surprise! Youâre a loser once again. Enjoy your prize!  Perhaps thatâs why the crowd was so quick in discarding their old cards after bingo was called, and I stood by holding on to the vain hope that I might still have a chance. These were battle-scarred veterans of the bingo trenches, and they had lost time and time and time again in hundreds of other bingo halls than this one, and they knew deep down that bingo games are fleeting and the call of âbingoâ always spelled defeat for the masses.  Imagine that. One night, fifteen games, fifteen times a loser. How many times had the people in the hall come out and played at this hall? At other halls? More than once a week? Hundreds of losses a month, perhaps thousands a year? How many years had these people, these middle-aged parents and retirees, come to the hall and willingly subjected themselves to the buildup and guaranteed letdown, only to come back again and again like lab rats receiving electric shocks? All for what? For the possibility of winning, if just once?  For the life of me, I cannot think of a single victory that is worth the tremendous amount of loss that success commands as sacrifice.  And what of competition that you can control? Not something as random as a bingo game, or the calling of numbers. What about sport, athletic competition? What about academic competition? Areas where victory can be achieved through hard work and dedication, or so the self-help books would have you believe. What about these seemingly noble pursuits? It may feel differently, but in the end itâs the same as the games of bingo.  All that hard work, practice and perseverance serves only to steady you through the repetitive failures on your path towards winning. Whether youâre a boxer learning the ropes by getting pummeled by contenders during undercard bouts, or a baseball player slumming it in single-A ball as your flat 85 MPH fastball continuously is crushed over the left-center wall, or an Olympic swimmer trying every four years to even make a spot on the national team, itâs all the same. When youâre coming up, itâs all blood sweat and tears.  And what comes of final victory? When you can finally hold that belt, that medal, that trophy high above your head and scream, âI AM THE BESTâ at the top of your lungs, what have you accomplished? Your time at the top is fleeting; you are now the single target for everyone else to best, to conquer and to take over. From the moment you win you are now defending your title, and it is only a matter of time before you are dethroned. Someone will be better than you, or you will grow old and lose your abilities, or the game will change and you wonât be able to effectively compete. Victory is fleeting; only defeat is a constant.  And yet here we are, lining up and willingly putting ourselves in the crossfire, playing the game and entering the tournament and buying a slice of the lottery and crossing our fingers and deluding ourselves that it will be anything other than what it always is â in the end, itâs always defeat.  Youâd think weâd learn from watching centuries of wars; there is no victor, only dead bodies.  My friends often tell me that I place too much emphasis on silly things, like bingo games and baseball games. Perhaps theyâre right. But until I see things differently, Iâm going to stay away from the head-to-head for a while. Because, to paraphrase (and turn around) a famous phrase, it is never better to have tried and lost than never to have tried at all. Because, so many times, to try is to lose.  And Iâm tired of losing.   -Mr. Carson",male,24,Internet,Aries,0

This can be the one that you are currently in, or a fictional one; Iâm not picky. So, there you are, with your boyfriend/girlfriend. This begs a question. Are the two of you (insert gender)-friends? Or are you dating? Friends with benefits? Together? Labels, my good people, are one of the first problems you run into in your relationship. The unequivocal insanity that circles labeling a relationship is mind-boggling to most, yet seemingly unavoidable. Because you canât have two people romantically involved without there being some way to classify it. Even the term âromantically involvedâ is a label; it infers that there is more to you and another person than just a friendship. We must have a way to tell other people our social status. Otherwise, how would others know whether or not they can approach us? Fear not, readers, for there is a spectrum to romantic labeling, stretching the entire gamut of being (label) more than friends.  The relationship spectrum.   This topic is rarely spoken about; in fact, I believe that I will be the first person to ever put it down in writing. It is one of those life-long lessons learned in the hallways of school, not in the classroom. Right up there with how to fit an entire circus tent in the size of a locker, and how to make really neat hand puppets with sanitary napkins.  The relationship spectrum.    If this spectrum was patented and placed in most public bathroom stalls, I believe that the amount of stress people go through would decrease dramatically. Plus you would probably have a lot less alcoholism and drug dependency. This problem is that severe.  The relationship spectrum.   I fully understand that by doing this, I might completely change the love-sex continuum that we all know and take advantage of. This could be the end of life as we in the 18-24 demographic know it. I apologize in advance, and hope that at some point in the future, my children will find it in their heart to forgive me.   The relationship spectrum.   Note: I have narrowed the spectrum down to five points, which I feel is as low as you can do while still being accurate. Anyone who disputes this, well, canât do much of anything. Far Left: Singality This is the easiest position to be in. You have no attachments to anyone. You are free to walk the romantic field without any fear of being hamstrung from behind. You are a wild horse grazing on the open plain. You are as free as an eagle soaring over the Grand Canyon. And yes, you are as sexually frustrated as every convict this side of the Mississippi. Put together. This fact completely overrides the other two, and most are beside themselves trying to get out of this position.   Middle Left: FB FB can stand for a few things. âFriends with benefitsâ is one of the more common ones. So is âFuck Buddies.â  Regardless of the actual term, this is the next stage in the relationship spectrum; the âlustâ stage. There is no real romantic attraction here; this is you and a friend who, when the time permits, take out the sexual frustrations accumulated by your respective singalities on each other like wild tigers. Many of these FBâs get this way spontaneously, where it is âHowâs the summer been?â one moment, and âWhatâs my name?â in the next. There are others, however, who are much more methodical about it. They make sure that there is no mistake that they are FBâs, and FBâs alone. It is only after that has been established that the clothes can fly. These ones have it better than their âsex on the flyâ compatriots, for they do not have to deal with the difficult problem that I will call the ânext-day talk.â  This is the same conversation the methodical ones had before, but added to the mix is the memory of the past nights debauchery.  It can get rather messy, this ânext-day talk,â since many FBâers find themselves paired off with someone who wants a bit more than that, which doesnât work at all. If any of you are interested in becoming an FB, I donât discourage it. I only advise that you are methodically careful of which friend you decide to benefit.   Center: âDatingâ I use quotations around this title because this same stage has many other terms. âSeeing each other.â âRomantically involved.â Other times, words are placed before âdatingâ to further exemplify the stage. âCasual datingâ is one of these. So is âJust datingâ or its partner in crime âOnly dating.â  Regardless of which label one chooses to attach, the stage remains the same. There is no commitment here. That, essentially, is what people are saying when using the âdatingâ label. Ya, Iâm into this one, and weâre dating, but that doesnât mean I canât see other people if they just so happen to fall in my lap.  Most relationships start out this way, because unless it is one of those âlove at first sightâ things, you donât know whether or not you want to be with this person, so you leave yourself a loophole in case you need an escape. You also find many commitment-phobes in this area. This is a good place to be, if you play your cards right. The problem is that playing your cards right in this stage is harder than Bob Dole on Viagara, so many people get into lots of trouble. Most relationships die in this stage, as the people in it are not ready or willing to continue, seeing the headaches theyâre facing so early on. Being in the dating phase brings up lots of questions, such as âseeing other people,â âcommitmentâ and âdo we have sex when weâre just dating?â  A lot of times, it is that third question that forces people into the later stages. So we move on.  Middle Right: âTogetherâ I debated using this as a phase, since I think it is one of the lesser-known and used stages in the spectrum. However, I use it for one reason and one reason only. That is because somehow, at some point in the evolution of relationships as we know them, the term together became associated with exclusiveness. If you were to take someone, show them a couple, and say there were together, Iâm nearly positive that they would assume that they were only seeing each other. This is the stage where the two participants want to be in the final stage, but are afraid. They could be afraid that as soon as it happens, their partner will magically turn into someone closely resembling the mother from the Goonies. They could also be afraid that as soon as it happens, Mr. More Right than the person youâre with will walk by, see you with Mr. Looks Pretty Bad, and disappear. However, in my own opinion, I believe that most people are afraid that their partner doesnât feel the same way, so theyâll spend years in this stage, hoping the other makes the first move. It is a good idea if youâre an observer of this, to hit both participants over the head with a rock. It wonât do much for them, but youâll sure feel better. Occasionally, you might run into someone who is staying in the âtogetherâ phase to get the benefits of the final stage, but the supposed freedom of dating. These are more likely than not men, and theyâll end up with their genitals cut off, so we donât worry about them.   Far Right: Officialness Well, youâve survived this far. Youâve probably progressed through most of these stages, not necessarily with the person youâre now with, but regardless, youâre here. Time to relax and enjoy the time you have with your significant other. But donât call them that. Because that might make them think youâre trying to sound like youâre just âtogether,â and that wonât work. Oh, and if I were you, Iâd never slip up and just call them my âfriend.â Thatâs when far right becomes far left real quick. And, donât call them by name. Because that isnât sweet enough, and it also might make them think youâre not taking this as seriously as you should be. So, relax with your âexclusively official gender-friendâ. That should put you in the clear.  Where am I going with all this? Besides, probably, to the far left where I will remain, blind and with hairy palms for all of eternity? Iâm trying to make you see that this labeling business is getting way out of hand. We as a people are putting too much emphasis on what we call our relationships, and not enough on the relationship itself. If we dedicated the time and effort to making our relationship work that we do to what weâre calling it, we would be happier, healthier, and having much more sex. âTil next time, this is your âunofficially inclusive friendâ signing off.    --Brendan Tormey",male,24,Internet,Aries,0

378424,1510754,2004-07-01,"The farther back I go in my memory, the less significant and ordered the memories are. When I think about it, I realize that Iâve forgotten MOST of whatâs happened over the course of my life and I guess itâs like that for everyone. The minute something is over, we start to forget no matter what it is. Even if we can hold on to most of it, we canât seem to keep it totally. The more significant an event is to us, the more likely we are to remember it but even those only linger as shadows. Few of those precious moments hang in our heads for long. Itâs almost like weâre anxious to get rid of themâ¦ or theyâre anxious to leave. Memory does that. It evaporates like smoke through our fingers and, eventually, itâs not even memory any more. Yet it still affects us, whatever the happening was, and sometimes thatâs what makes forgetting the hardest. Weâre left with whyâs and no means to seek out the answer.  Maybe thatâs why Iâm writing â to salvage whatâs still there before it blurs behind warped glass.  I think I still remember whatâs important, though, and thatâs what counts. God forbid I should ever be able to remember everything â every blessed moment of laughter and heartache.   My first memory is of a green bathtub that I had when I was 2 or 3. I know that I thought of it as a boat and that I was bathed in it by my mother who, then, was an angel â the kind without the flaming sword. She sang like an angel as well, and thatâs my next earliest memory â my mother singing to the radio. I guess it doesnât matter what I thought of her singing. She was my mother and when she sang I felt filled up by her voice. When I was a little older, Iâd stand outside of the bathroom when she was showering and listen to her sing. I still do that sometimes though I donât think she knows.  Until recently I would have gladly exchanged that memory for something more dramatic â  a story that was more of an obvious microcosm of my life. Maybe the first time I touched a piano keyboard â I ended up writing a song. My first word or my first tooth, hell, ANY first would have done fine. But I only had thisâ¦ my mother as an angel and me, going dirty to clean, in my unbreakable plastic boat.  Itâs funny how something as mundane as a plastic tub can come to be so significant. It was the first thing in my life that my brain decided to tuck away for safe keeping.  I liked thinking about my mother that way â as an angel. Gigantic feathery wings, brilliantly white robes giving off impossibly bright light, a gently bent smile, warm and infinite eyes, forever warm, never angry, never upset, and always watching. She was like that in my reality at that age. I loved her then more honestly than I have ever loved anyone or anything since. It was beautiful.  	Now years have passed between us, complicating everything weâve touched and I often wonder how much of that love is still there. 23 years of growing up have put a sizable gap between the boy in the tub and me. Bitter years of fighting, misunderstanding, confusion, and such have put me and mom on opposite ends of the room many times. There seems to be so much to disagree and tussle over these days. Life has a way of doing that sometimes. Weâve faced off on so many issues now that it seems that we can only love each other deep down. And we never talk about it. I canât honestly remember the last time I told my mother that I loved her.  	Last night, as I was writing this, my mother called for me... yelled for me, really. As always, I immediately got defensive. Making my way upstairs, I decided to tell her about the memory of the tub and her. I told myself that I needed to confirm the story. If the kid in the tub still lives in me, he wonders, while Iâm writing this, what had happened to the angel. I thought about all this as I went upstairs. My love for my mother had changed. No longer was it this simple chubby smile out of nowhere. I now have 23 years worth of reasons to love her. Yet there was something about the love that the kid had for that angel. It hurt me that things had gotten to be the way that they were between my mom and I. By no means terrible but 23 years has a way of bleeding the innocence out of any relationship. Iâd give anything to be that kid again. She had called me to help with groceries and while I handled them off to the fridge and cabinets, I told her about the memory of the tub. A much simpler version than written here â just that I remembered the tub that was my âboatâ.   For a second, I thought I was going to hear âWhat are you talking about?â if anything at all and I suppose that would have been fine. Instead, she caught me off guard. âYou remember that?â, she said and smiled. It was right then that I saw her â the angel â right there in front of me. I let her smile a minute longer before turning on my heels, groceries still in bags, and went back to the basement before my vision blurred and spilled over.   	Somewhere inside me, the kid in the tub still lives. Iâm pretty sure of that now.   Dexter Otis Green",male,24,Internet,Aries,0
378425,1510754,2004-07-01,"A Treatise on Divine Intervention â 8/27/03   Much of this little corner of cyberspace has been dominated lately by discussions concerning the existence of a Divine Creator; whether He really exists, what is His plan for his creation, whether He is really a She, and all sorts of fun bits of trivia St. Augustine probably bored his dinner guests with. In the spirit of academic collaboration, I hereby throw my hat into the ring. And, since September is âEarly Modern Western Theological Philosophy Monthâ in the state of South Dakota, Iâll begin by forming my argument from first principles.  To begin, a caveat.  I am an atheist.  This statement is going to affect my arguments concerning the topic at hand. First and foremost is my lack of faith in the presence of a God/many Gods/all-encompassing Spirit/etc. I do not disdain faith, however. This is a common misconception among the God-fearing population at large concerning the atheist. I feel faith is one of the most essential human qualities, and allows people to strive for greatness when their path is unclear. As the apostles had faith in Jesus the Savior, so did Galileo have faith in a sun-centered solar system, as did Newton have faith in gravity and Pasteur have faith in the germ theory of spontaneous generation (translation: bugs make ya sick). The common thread of all faith is a trust in the existence of that which cannot be proven. Some have faith in God, I have faith in the evolution of life from a puddle of goo. Try to prove either.  Now I ask the religious in the audience to stick around until the end. Yes, I am an atheist, but Iâm not here to argue against the existence of God. My esteemed colleague Dexter Otis Green already did quite a number on the Almighty a couple of weeks previously and it would be foolish of me to try to follow in his footsteps. Instead, Iâm going to start from the same basis as our esteemed European thinkers did three or four hundred years ago.   Letâs assume, just for fun, that there is a God.   A number of postulates follow from this assumption. First, if there is a God, He (sorry girls, but itâs easier to keep with tradition than writing She or He/She or S/He or It or The Great Hermaphroditic Force in the Sky â my apologies) must play some sort of role in existence as we know it. Regardless of whether He is a part of reality, or outside reality, or however you want to conceive of Him, His handprint must be a part of our perceived universe simply because He exists, is all-powerful and played some sort of role in the creation of all this muckety-muck.   Secondly, if He does exist, and does play a role in existence, then we can assume that He can directly affect the goings-on in reality. This follows from the assumption that God is all-powerful. We can elevate this statement as a postulate simply because if God wasnât all-powerful, he wouldnât be God and therefore would be a great big cipher in existence. Therefore, all sorts of biblical craziness becomes plausible, from creation to the words of the prophets to burning bushes to plagues to the commandments.  This isnât to say it happened exactly to the letter of the Good Book, but it allows for such things to occur.  So, letâs recap our first principles, a la Descartes:  1)	There is a God 2)	He is all-powerful 3)	He must play a role in existence, either through existing within itâs boundaries or by affecting things within the boundaries of existence 4)	THEREFORE: God must be able to interact with existence 5)	THEREFORE: God must be able to interact with us  Simple enough, right? Conclusion #5 follows from our connection with reality. Now, however, comes the tricky part. If God can interact with us, and God does interact with us, then God must have a motive for interacting with us. This leads to another interesting conclusion:  1)	God must be able to interact with us 2)	God can affect changes in existence through his interactions with us 3)	THEREFORE: God must have a motivation for his interactions with us 4)	THEREFORE: God must desire to make changes in existence  This is extremely important. For God to interfere in the daily activities of mere mortals, he must have a motivation to act. If he has a motivation, he has a desire. And if God has desires, then God must have actions that support his desires and that detract from his desires. Such is the basis for sin â actions by mortals that act in counter to the desires of God.   AHA! But how could mere mortals hope to understand the mind of the infinite? How can we determine what is and what is not part of Godâs plan? Itâs not possible - unless God himself gives us a clue about what and what not to do. And as we stated before, God is perfectly capable of interacting with us when and how He pleases. And now we reach a critical juncture in our understanding of the Big Cheese:  1)	God has desires for His creation 2)	Creation cannot deduce the mind of God (because the finite mind cannot comprehend the infinite) 3)	THEREFORE: For creation to understand the desires of God, He must allow his desires to be known 4)	THEREFORE: God must expose his desires to Creation through His interactions with it.  Now weâre able to bring in the Bible, the Koran, the Torah and Talmud, the words of the prophets, the burning bushes, the dead sea scrolls and anything else documenting the interactions of God with his creation. One can still argue that the true desires of God can be diluted or distorted by those who document His works, but this does not affect the original motivation or the actual occurrence. God works in mysterious ways, which means humanity more often than not will probably miss the point, but that doesnât stop God from trying.  Now that weâve defined our God, we should be able to conceive of how we choose to interact with Him. And here, finally, is my theory concerning God.  If there is a God, we should spend less time worshipping him and more time preparing for him.  Itâs clear from the classic works of western monotheism that God takes care of His people. When he chose Abraham and Sarah as the first of his great people, he gave to them the land of Israel, and watched over their development as the first great civilization to know God. When they strayed from his teachings, he allowed the Godless Egyptians to enslave them and destroy the great temple at Jerusalem. However, He did not condemn His people; when they had learned their lesson, he sent a great prophet to lead them out of bondage and back to their promised land. He sent them a code of laws to live by so that they may live according to His will. These great laws were written in stone and placed in the Ark of the Covenant, which the descendants of the slaves used to conquer the Godless tribes that inhabited the Promised Land in the Israelitesâ absence. The Old Testament tells of Joshua marching the Ark around the fortified city of Jericho, causing the walls to collapse out of the sheer power of Godâs will. When again the Israelites lost their way, he sent His only son to live among the people, to learn of the plight of mortality and to share the glory of the Kingdom of Heaven with Godâs creation. He then allowed all of civilization to know of his glory, through the works of the apostles and the teachings of the great prophet Mohammad. God, it can be said, takes care of his peeps.  But look at the world that we live in today. Our great God-fearing country is beset on all sides by the tyranny of evil men, to borrow a phrase. People working in the Almightyâs name murdered thousands of Americans in the attacks on the Twin Towers. The great Christian countries of the Western world are under attack by the Eastern Islamic peoples who see Westernization as the mark of the Great Satan. The holy land itself is a war zone, where children are torn apart by suicide bombers in the shadow of the once great and holy Temple in Jerusalem. The great countries of Pakistan and India are close to a nuclear holocaust, spurred by land disputes but fueled by differences in religion. Belfast has been in tatters for centuries because of differences in Christian denominations, not even divides in religions. Much of the conflict in the world today is either directly caused or indirectly motivated by differences in religions that have at their core a faith in God.  So how do we view Godâs divine plan in the light of recent events? Are we, the Great Western World, the harbingers of peace and justice? Is God on our side as we force our own brand of peace through free trade on the proud peoples of the Middle East? Or are we actually playing the role of the Egyptians, enslaving Godâs people with our sinful ways and our Western ideals which are counter to His will? What gives us the preconception that God might actually be on our side? Donât forget our previous postulate: we cannot know the mind of God, for the finite mind cannot understand the infinite.  So who knows where we stand? What we do know is that, for whatever reason, God feels no desire to step in at the present time and heal the pain and sorrow of millions. He felt no desire to stop the suicide bombings in Gaza; no desire to stop the state-sponsored killings in many an Islamic fundamentalist state; no desire to divert the planes from their intended targets two Septembers ago. So we must ask ourselves: what is God trying to tell His creation with his inaction?  Perhaps it is time to stop acting in Godâs name, and time to start preparing for the coming of Godâs wrath. For I guarantee that many a faithful person died in the Trade Center attacks, and I wonder why God failed to save their lives that day - much as God fails to save the lives of those killed by U.S. bombs worldwide.  Who dares to understand the mind of such a vengeful God?  -Mr. Carson",male,24,Internet,Aries,0
378426,1510754,2004-07-01,"Well, itâs that time again. Time for me to delve into the deep reaches of my mind, and put my thoughts down on paper. Todayâs topic will follow along with my colleagueâs topic, and weâll touch on religion. More specifically, this is just a list of questions that I have for the higher power. Now, before I go into the meat and potatoes of this writing, let me first set the stage in terms of my own beliefs and feelings on religion. I consider myself a spiritual person, but not a religious person. What this means is that I donât subscribe to any particular group or religious affiliation. I donât feel like I need to go anywhere or otherwise do anything special to be closer to a being which I feel I am constant communication with. Iâve read a little about a variety of religions, and I find pieces of each one that I like, but Iâve yet to find one I am willing to completely throw myself into. However, I was raised Catholic, so that is where a lot of my basis in religion is. Therefore, I will be referring to a majority of things in the Catholic sense (i.e. God, Jesus, Father Copafeel.)  Well, I believe that covers it. Now, as I said before, this is just a list of questions I have for the higher power that I believe exists.   --Why, if you truly exist like I believe you do, is there any question about your existence? Wouldnât you want your creation to know of your presence? Iâm all for the modesty aspect, but donât you think life would be a lot easier if you made yourself known? I mean, the whole evolution vs. creation debate would be settled, and then those people could do something more worthwhile with their time, like find a cure for cancer, or paint my house, or something more meaningful than bickering over a topic that could be easily settled by just one hand writing âIâm here, you foolsâ on the wall.  --Everything happens for a reason, right? Even trite things like fashion? If so, what was the purpose of parachute pants? Poodle skirts? The bee-hive hairdo? Hmâ¦Maybe itâs your way of telling us that we shouldnât be taking life so seriously. I mean, honestly, do you honestly expect anyone to be able to look at those bubble pants people wear these days and not laugh? This must be proof that you have a sense of humor.  --What is with the fanaticism of organized religion? More specifically, why are there so many different ones? You know which one is right, so why do you allow other people to practice âfalseâ religions? If they were all one and the same, just different names, Id understand, but there are differences abound. Or is that the point? Are we supposed to realize how silly we are being, and therefore, try to come to a consensus. If so, Id take another look at humans, because we are eons away from that ability. We canât agree on what we want on our pizza, and thatâs with people of our own color and culture. Come on, omniscient one, give us our due.   --Love handlesâ¦Why?  --Finally, Is there a perfect person for everyone out there? A Mr/Ms. Right? Someone who can know everything about you from just a seconds glance, and yet still spend hours on end listening to you ramble on and on without ever once looking bored or lost? Someone who understands and accepts every single one of your quirks, no matter how strange they might be? Someone who fits into that emptiness that can lie inside your heart, and by fitting into that space, make you whole? Why arenât we born with these people? Wouldnât that make life easier?

Our sense of self worth stems from the many different people, events, and circumstances in our lives.  Since our last commentator focused exclusively on self worth as related to God my retort will as well.  What then are our options in trying to decide whether or not there is a God.    1. There is no God 2. There is a God, but he does not care 3. There is a God, but he does not have control (and maybe never did) 4. There is a God, and He is all powerful   THERE IS NO GOD  Enough space has been allotted to this option.     THERE IS A GOD, BUT HE DOES NOT CARE  This option, it seems, is believed by many.  I do not think that people want to believe it.  I do, though, think that deep down many people do.  There are certainly valid arguments for this type of God.  To many God is distant and cold, cutting down people in their prime, giving to the rich and taking from the poor.  God starves the poor and feeds the rich.    My hope is that our God is not this God.     THERE IS A GOD, BUT HE DOES NOT HAVE CONTROL  What if God did create all?  What if He at the very least set things in motion?  And, what if after he set these things in motion He lost control?  Is this the God that we have?  What does the evidence point to?  The state of our world could certainly be viewed in a way that would lead us to this conclusion.  Our world, as viewed by some at least, is getting worse and worse.  Traditional values and morals are in decline.  The world community is in turmoil over a great number of issues.  All over the world things are getting worse and worse.    Is this our God?  I hope not.   THERE IS A GOD, AND HE IS ALL POWERFUL  What if God did create all?  What if He set things in motion and has remained in control all this time?  There are many people of many different faiths that would say without hesitation that this is the type of God that we have.  What evidence do we have to support this though?  We have the personal testimony of millions of people throughout the ages.  Also, the many who have gladly been willing to die for their God.  There are the stories of miracles, healings, visions, etc.  The majority of the world will tell you of the all-powerful God that we have.  Is this enough though?   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------   I don not have concrete evidence to prove the existence of God.  No one does.  Faith is just that, faith.  It is a very personal thing.  People see God in many different ways.  Stories from a personï¿½s life may be touching and may convince some of the existence of God, but there is no concrete evidence to be had.  So, it seems that I have not truly countered my fellow bloggers last post.  That, however, was not my intent.  My intent is simply to say that there are many different viewpoints in this world.  Those who do believe in some kind of God are not necessarily acting simply on blind faith.  Having faith, or not, does not mean you are stupid or ignorant.  Many people have spent their lifetimes searching for God.  Are those searches meaningless?  I think not.  ï¿½---ï¿½",male,24,Internet,Aries,0

I've heard that God is in everything and everyone or, to a lesser extent, God created all that is. It is no wonder then that he should be reflected in all things. What?!  Lies.    God created nothing.  You created God.   I defy any of you readers to prove otherwise. The first person to do so may have a week's worth of my pay or $1,000 - whichever is of greater value. Bring me your blind faith, your ancient texts, your mother's wisdom, your miracle tales - bring me the lot of your ambiguous ""evidence""?. I'll listen kindly to your D&D myth and then I'll tell you who is truly responsible for it all.   Me.   That's right.   Dexter did it... or, to put it another way...  Dexter is God.   Can you prove otherwise? Can you honestly say that you have a shred of evidence against such a claim? No. You cannot. It is impossible to have any such evidence and I'll tell you why.   Firstly, God is an ambiguous concept. What or who is God? What's God's purpose? There's a question whose answer will never be agree upon.    God is Jesus. God is an elephant. God is a chubby Asian who can dance the watusi. God is a castrated hippie in Kentucky.    If an agreement can't be reached on who or what God is then how is it that you could tell me who or what God isn't. I could just disagree! Nothing can be proven or disproven as truth.  Secondly, any evidence you have against me being God must be faith based. There is no evidence for God nor God himself cannot be defined. The only thing that will stand up to faith in an argument is stronger faith, different faith, and facts. Faith, by itself, is no proof at all.   I win.   Faith takes the place of rational consideration. It's the un-think potion - and that's not always a bad thing. I have faith that beer will get me drunk, faith that chicks will constantly hit on me and buy me things - both against my will - (it's the honest truth), and I have faith that republicans and democrats will eventually fade away. Pretty harmless I'd say. Your faith however in God, however, encourages discrimination and emotional self-mutilation. The magic about your faith is that it is self-healing, self-regenerating, self-sustaining, and, best of all, it's free, right? Just check your soul and wallet at the door!   Allow me to clear a few things up if I may....   Your God has done nothing  and will continue to do so for all eternity. He will keep you in fear of swearing and loving cheating on your taxes. He will force you into temples and mosks and churches. He will bore you with his sermons, jade you with his lying clergy, depress you daily by affirming through his bible that you are not now, nor will you ever be, good enough. He will gleefully pluck the dollars from your pockets so that he may line the pockets of his most dedicated and charismatic peddlers. He will terrorize you with his demons, his devils, his imps, and his Lake of Fire, and, most of all, He will not answer your prayers when you really need him to - ever. He will demand that you obsess over him constantly. He will beat you and tell you that he loves you. He wants your soul and nothing else...  He loves you.   He has given us all an innate desire for LIFE (sex, drugs, food, love in all it's forms) and all that it offers and yet he demands that you deny yourself the very things you crave. He wants you to be in need so that you'll seek him. He wants you distracted by pomp and ceremony lest you open your eyes and live a little. He doesn't want you asking questions. He wants you as a shield.. .he needs YOU to defend him with your imperfect knowledge because... well he's only God - he gets pretty busy and, besides, he can't do much in his old age. He doesn't want you thinking outside of the box - ever. He wants you to recycle the same tired rhetoric that was feed to you so that you can feed it to your children if you haven't done so already. Everything you think is wrong. Everything thing you love is evil. Everything you want is poison.... Unless it has to do with him, that is.   In exchange, you get ""direction""? and a [false] sense of self-worth based on someone or something (or neither) that loves you.   Suckers.   God is proof that we're worth it. God is proof that we aren't an accident. God is . God gives us hope for the future. God makes me feel good because I know we aren't alone. When I'm alone and afraid or whenever I need HIM, I can get down on my knees, close my eyes, and smoke the throbbing meat-pipe of Christ and everything will be ok if I just believe forever and ever and ever amen. Right? Right?   God is a reason to choke off damn near every instinct so that you may be closer to his divine such-'n'-such. God is a reason to be afraid. That's right. God is the reason you're angry with homosexuals. God is the reason that you feel alone. God is the reason you're angry with yourself. Understand something. No matter what you say or do, you will never be good enough for him. He'll beat you and love you and beat you and love you and [Tithes and offering! - I'm the most powerful being of all time but I can't get enough of your money!!] he'll plant his holy sausage in your face as long as you let him.   Call me a God-basher if you'd like - That is certainly your prerogative. Shield yourself with your rhetoric. Vomit up your propaganda, rename it and re-chew it all you like. It all boils down to the same thing...   You believe in ______ .   Your God that encourages genocide and love at the same time. Read Genesis through Deuteronomy. A God that'll lie about love will lie about anything. If he IS real, he certainly isn't consistent, reliable, or trustworthy.   In other words, even if your sadist of a God is real, he's likely lying when he says that you're special.   Don't get me wrong - I'm not encouraging anyone to be an atheist at all. I'm simply encouraging you to consider the possibility that you may be deluded. Go on and tell me I'm wrong.   You'll say to me, ""Well Drew, can you prove he DOESN'T exist?"" Hmmm. Well, ma'am or sir, I could make up something as wacky (but never as effective, I'll give you that) as God and say it's real. Then I could easily write a book about it and get a bunch of people to believe in it. At that point, how would you feel if I challenged you to prove that MY God didn't exist? You're the one that made the outrageous claim that God is real - the burden of proof is on you. The only claim I'm making is that what I've been told about God is bullshit.  If you're counting on HIM to make you feel special or to prove that you're worth it, you're wasting your time. He simply doesn't exist.   I'll get to those of you who don't believe in God and still think you're special in a later segment. I've spent the better part of 2.5 hours trying to be as polite as I can. It's 3:30am and I am tired. I will say this...  If you can not live with the fact that you may not be special... that you may just be some cosmic burp then you will most certainly find a reason to disprove or at least blind yourself to the possibility of such a notion.    God is what happens when we stop believing in ourselves.    Once you accept the fact that you are what you are for better or worse, no magic Daddyman in the sky is necessary. If you can't accept that, at least take comfort in knowing that Jesus and Santa both love you very much. If it came down to a matter of choice, however, I'd pick Santa. I'm pretty sure that he delivers.   You have been judged.",male,24,Internet,Aries,0
378431,1510754,2004-07-01,"Quest for a name: A documentary...  We find our hero high atop Mt. Kilimanjaro, where he is searching out the great wildebeest. Wait, that's Jim Fowler.   We find our hero deep in the Adriatic, where he is searching out the great tiger shark.  Wait, that's Jacques Cousteau.  We find our hero sitting around his room, where he is searching out a matching pair of socks. Yep, that's me.  It has come to my attention that in order to be a true full-fledged member of this elite association, I need a nickname. You know, that thing to go between the quotes. I suppose its so that I dont need to type my whole name when I write something, or so that the critics of my articles have another way that they can hurl insults at me. Either way, I was told I need one, so venture with me now as I set out to find myself a nickname. And I have decided that in order to accomplish this lofty goal, I will discuss with you now the reason that I have found myself in this place; and that is fate.  I have probably mentioned this more than once before, but its one of the core truths of my existence, so Ill say it again; I am a fatalist. This is the closest thing I have to an organized religion. I believe that everything happens for a reason, from the choices we make in love and money to how many tater tots we take at breakfast. Every single action that takes place in the world is meant to happen. This may seem, to some, to be a fairly radical stance on the topic. Most would say that they have a moderate belief in fate, but that they also have some free will to serve as a counterbalance. I think free will is a marvelous idea, but I dont buy it. If you look at some of the atrocities of human existence, both tragic (Pol Pot's massacre in Cambodia) and trivial (Bubble Gum music), you can't honestly tell me that these people made the free decision to do what they did. It was decided for them, and they are simply reacting to the conditions given them. Others might say that my stance on fatalism is so radical, I should be simply sitting around and doing nothing, waiting for something to happen. I suppose that could be the case, if I were not aware of my beliefs. However, since I know where I stand, I can live my life without fear, knowing that my every action was planned out beforehand. Thus, when I decide on the word that will go between my quotes, I will be 100% content with it, knowing that nothing else would work.    Which brings me, faithful reader, to my name. I sat a spell, and thought about fate, and where it has taken me so far in my travels on this Earth. I thought of my early days growing up in the south of England. I thought of the day my life completely changed, and my parents and I moved to America. I thought of my high school days. I thought of college, and of my life to come. And I realized something...Noone can pronounce my last name. Of course, this realization had nothing to do, really, with my contemplations, but it was shocking, nonetheless. My last name isnt really that hard to get. Its only 6 letters, and it doesnt seem really foreign or anything. I blame it on ""The Golden Fog"", Mr. Mel Torme. See, he pronounces his name ""Tor-May"", and being that he is the most famous (or only) person with a name even closesly resembling mine, I feel he is responsible for this problem I have encountered.    My name is pronounced ""Tor-Me"", as in   he tore me off a piece of paper      So, Im a future teacher with, apparently, a hard to pronounce last name. This will not do. I can't have kids spending hours trying to pronounce my name; it will hinder the learning process. Luckily, a friend fixed this problem for me. ""Just call yourself Mr. T. Theyll be able to pronounce that."" Mr. T...Hm...Still enables me to be formal with my students, but is easy for them to pronounce. It also hints at a touch of bad-assness, for I pity the fool who wants to mess with Mr. T!  So, this is it. Fate has brought me to this moment, where I no longer am Brendan Tormey, the unpronouncable wonder, but I am Brendan ""Mr T"" Tormey, the unpronouncable wonder who will throw you through a window if you mess with him.

378432,1510754,2004-07-01,"The clothes we wearâ¦It sounds like a really bad informational video youâd have to watch if you got a job at T.J. Maxx or something. In my last article, I touched on fashion, and how silly some of the things we as humans have worn over the course of our existence. This time, the first decade of the 21st century (I donât know what weâre calling it), is no exception. What follows is a list of different fashion/personal appearance trends or other issues that I have problems with. If I touch on a certain style that you cater to, please donât take offense. Contrarily, please contact me and enlighten me on the rationale behind it. Although some of these will be fairly hard to defend. Here they go, in no particular order.   -Capri Pants. These confuse me. Are they pants, or are they shorts? People who wear them look like they are wearing pants that are too small, and are too lazy to buy new ones. Someone told me that itâs for when its too hot for pants, but too cold for shortsâ¦So the 3 Â¼ inches of leg that shows in Capri pants makes all the difference? I have a hard time seeing that. Going along with this are those people who have actual pants, but feel the need to roll their pant legs up into Capriâs. What is this morbid fascination with the lower half of calves? Weird people.  -Itâs apparent that a lot of people have much too much time on their hands. I can tell this by seeing the amount of effort that people are putting into their everyday appearance. I can understand the occasional social event that you doll yourself up for, but the college students who act like every day of class is their senior prom really confuse me. For example, I had an 8 AM today, and I saw a lot of girls with styled hair and make-up, wearing an outfit in which everything matched. That means that they probably got up at 6 to spend 90 minutes getting ready, for a 75 minute class. I think there should be a law stating that people can not take more time getting ready for something than the actual event lasts. Think of the scientific advances that could be made with this time.   -Belts. These are a simple concept. A piece of material for the purpose of keeping pants up. Somewhere along the line, people decided that belts could be so much more, and now theyâre just silly. For example, the belts that donât serve their purpose. Iâve seen some that are like waistlaces (necklaces for the waist, for those laymen out there). Belts are for holding pants up. If its not going to do that, donât wear one! Also, there are people who go the opposite route. Iâm referring to those people who have belts larger than most weight belts you see in the Worldâs Strongest Man competition. Unless your pants happen to weigh a metric ton, you donât need industrial strength leather. Please, people, think of the cows.   -I like necklaces, donât get me wrong. I think itâs perfectly fine to wear a chain, Iâve done it myself. However, there is a limit to how many you can wear without looking ridiculous. That limit is one. Why do you possibly need more than one? Iâve yet to meet a person who has ever said, âOh, look. That guy/girl has the U.S. Mint on his/her neck. Letâs get it on!â Unless you need to show off your supposed affluence through the amount of bling bling you got, in which case, you have other problems not covered in this diatribe, stick to one necklace per customer.   -I donât consider myself a very scientific man, but in the research I have done on the topic, I have discovered that it is almost physically impossible to have hair on top of your head that is one color, and facial hair that is another. Which brings up a valid question. Why do people do it? To me, these poor souls just look confused. âI donât know what Iâm doing, my hair is two different colors, I canât decide, Iâm lost.â Pick a color, and stick with it.  -Now, I donât think this applies to everyone, but I just need to ask the fine readers a question. Would you ever wear a button-down dress shirt with windpants? Ralph Lauren on top, Adidas down below. Does this make sense to anyone? What kind of job interview would you be going to? Along with this is another question. Dress shirt, dress pants, flip flops. Huh? No sense at all does this make to me. Please, good people, enlighten me.   -Artificial tanning. I donât get it. Itâs not like we live in Alaska, and the sun randomly disappears for weeks at a time. That, I could understand. But, the sun is there, my friends. I can see it. Why do you need to pay to do something that would happen if you just went outside? Iâm tan, but thatâs because my summer was spent half-nakedâ¦Working as a lifeguard. Get your minds out of the gutters, sickos!  -Now, guys, donât get mad at me for this next topic. Iâm criticizing, but Iâm not complaining. Actually, this applies to both genders. Paint on clothes. Muscle shirts, incrediblytightpantsthatlookliketheyhadtooilthemselvesuptosqueezeintothem, things like that. I have an idea for these people. If youâre that intent on leaving nothing to the imagination, just walk around naked. Iâm sure the people youre trying to impress wouldnât mind in the least.   -They call blue jeans blue jeans for a reason. And this reason is because they are blue. They are not blue with random white fade marks, or brown ones, or anything like that. So stop wearing pants like that! Did I sleep through some announcement which said that looking like you sat in bleach (or worse, if you wear the brown ones) was incredibly sexy. It makes you look like you donât change your clothes often.   -This one hits close to home, since one of my close friends seems to be the flag-bearer for this style, but it confuses me, and damn it, I will not let my own personal feelings get in the way of providing inanity to you, the readers! Wearing two t-shirts. For example, a white one under one with actual graphics or something. I guess it looks decent, but a t-shirt is supposed to be worn underneath a polo/dress shirt, not another t-shirt. Read the rulebook, guys.   -Speaking of T-shirts, how many people see a girl walking around with an âangelâ shirt on, and actually think that they are an angel? Most of the people walking around with shirts like this are, I hope, trying to make a point in being oppositional, since when you see a supposed âangelâ riding someone at a party, they donât really look like Godâs messengers.   -This isnât a criticism, just more of an open question. Have you ever seen a natural blond with a good goatee? Or any kind of facial hair? I havenât.   -Suit jacket, with T-Shirt underneath. Hm, are we harking back to the days of Don Johnson and Miami Vice? If so, do us all a favor. Move to Miami.  -Has anyone seen the sandals that arenât really sandals? Theyâre just a pair of shoes with small holes, so you can see approximately 1/64 of their foot, but thatâs it? Whatâs the point? Either wear full shoes or sandals. You donât need to ruin a pair of good shoes by slicing one quarter inch hole, and pretending itâs the latest trend. Once again, think of the cows.  -If you have a Bulls jersey, donât wear it with a Celtics hat. And donât wear Cowboys and Panthers stuff at the same time. This makes you look confused, and bi-partisan, and then youâll have people from both teams looking to kill you. To prove this point in detail, I actually saw someone wearing a Red Sox T-shirt with a Yankees hat. This guy, in Connecticut, is just looking for a lynching.   -People who wear big baggy T-shirts over short shorts, so you canât see the shorts underneath. This goes back to the paint-on clothes. Just donât wear shorts. No one could tell the difference anyway.   I think, my friends, this tells us a key point about human culture. Our priorities are all screwed up. We need to go all futuristic, with the matching silver outfits, so we could devote our time to more important things, like whatâs on TV. Oh, and maybe weâd find time to learn how to talk to each other too. But I doubt it.     --Brendan Tormey",male,24,Internet,Aries,0
378433,1510754,2004-07-01,"A Christmas Wish    ...(wiping)  ...(patting tummy)   And thus ends another successful Thanksgiving with my clan. I hope all went well for you and yours. This year, after a number of rough spots with my family, turkey day really put things into perspective. Despite all the madness that passes between us, we're still a family. And isn't that what it's all about? Indeed.   Thank sweet sweet Christ white folk butchered, raped, robbed, enslaved, and infected the indigenous peoples of the Americas. God forbid this day should have passed without me gorging myself on fruits torn from the fertile womb of mother earth.  ...there there... you didn't think I'd let an entry pass without a touch of cynicism now did you? :)  Thanksgiving is a holiday I can get behind. At its core, it's about family and togetherness. It's about remembering what's important; our family, our friends, our health, and our amazing fortune being afforded things like television, and electricity, and running water, and freedom. What with Bush's tedious war, our sag bottom economy, and the other ever lingering effects of September 11, things were certainly put into perspective for many of us this year. I, for one, am glad that someone chose turkey as the backdrop for all of this holiday introspection as I simply cannot think on an empty stomach much less count my blessings one by one. We have a hell of a lot to be thankful for.  Unfortunately on the heels of my favorite holiday comes the biggest lie I have ever been sold.  Friggin' Christmas.  The day after the magic of Thanksgiving, we go out in our empty cars and with empty hearts we collectively head out with one purpose in mind.  Presents.  Before I go any further, let me make something abundantly clear.  I HATE CHRISTMAS ... a lot. In fact, I can think of little else that I hate more than Christmas. Now before you go hollering ""Scrooge!"" and other empty Christmas-borne jargon, let me explain. Keep in mind, I'm not trying to convince you that you should also hate Christmas. This is just a blog and, as such, this is just one man's opinion. What's more, I don't really have words enough to express how I truly feel about Christmas. Indeed, such is my impassioned loathing for Christmas that I can barely organize my thoughts when the topic arises.  At the very mention of anything ""holly-jolly"", my blood boils and my brow crumples. My toes curl and my eyes darken. I feel sick to my stomach. I want absolutely nothing to do with it. Why?  Christmas is pretty much Thanksgiving II. And, as rare an occurrence as it is, in this case the sequel is better than the original because it comes with presents. Presents   and   turkey!! How can you top that, right? But wait! There's more! There are ciders and candy canes and discounts on all of your favorite big company's wares. There's holly and eggnog and lights and Santas in every mall. There's bonuses from your jobby-job There's roast this and baked that and jellied such-n-such with whipped topping. There's caroling and cards and worchester sauce. And, speaking of caroling, there are about one million of the happiest most splendiferous wonderful joyous yuletide songs that you could ever hope for and they are sung over and over and over - played on every radio station and oozing out of the mouths of every good and righteous citizen like so much golden honey. And all of this wonderment is glazed with universal love and warmth for our fellow man. Not to mention that it's Jesus's birthday. WOW! All that AND Christ? - Fuck thanksgiving, right? Bring on Christmas!  In reality, however, Christmas is a lot simpler. In fact, I daresay I can sum the whole shebang up in one word:    Presents . That's really what it's all about. That's all any of you tree-decorating happy ho-ho-ho'ing sonsofbitches really care about. Presents. Admit it.   No? Oh no wait it's not about presents? Damn it, you know you're right. I forgot about the one thing that makes Christmas so grand and awesome and totally badass. The Christmas Spirit, right? Man, what a dumbass I am for not remembering the good ol' Christmas Spirit. What a loser I am! The Christmas Spirit!! That's what makes it easier for us to deny a man some change - hell we know he's gonna buy drugs with it, right? Plus that means less money for presents! God forbid we should go out of our way even a little to help someone. I mean, Christ! - It's CHRISTmas! That good ol' Christmas Spirit reminds us to write out a long and impossible list as well. It reminds us to talk about love and consideration of those less fortunate but only for a little while and we don't have to mean it. And who has the time what with all the shopping and empty yuletide posturing we have to suffer through. But it's worth it, though. I mean, hell, even Christmas needs a cover. It can't just be about presents... that would just be plain shallow. The Christmas Spirit reminds us that without presents, there is no Christmas. Period. Damn... That sexy ass Christmas Spirit is pretty sweet. Good thing I remembered, huh? Must've been the Christmas Spirit that reminded me. Good ol' fine ass sexy ass Christmas Spirit.  Listen, I'm gonna level with you and let you in on a little secret. You like Christmas because you can afford it. Don't go on with this ""I barely have"" and ""we don't have"" and whatnot. You eat everyday multiple times a day. You have a warm place to sleep and clothes to wear. You can shower whenever you like. You have money to spend on Christmas. A small percentage of you fine readers know what it's like to be truly broke - to have absolutely no money whatsoever. The rest of you will just have a few less golden burritos and platinum big macs and your Christmas will turn out fine. My point? Glad you asked - If you truly couldn't afford Christmas, you'd feel differently about it. I'm not saying you'd hate it. I am saying, however, that it'd be much less about presents (if at all) and a lot more about... well what thanksgiving is about in some ways. Thanksgiving is about remembering how goddamn lucky we are. How grateful we should be that we have people that love us and that we have anything at all. What's that? Oh you buy it but you don't believe that it's all about presents, eh? Presents are just a little part of it and, were they gone, it wouldn't matter, right? You'd be like a bunch of goddamn Who's around the tree of your love holding hands and swaying back and forth in time singing a merry ol' Christmas Coolio remix, right? Ahh... I see. Then say, no thank you. Tell your family, you'd rather not have any presents this year. That their warmth and affection is enough. Hell, tell them to donate the $ they were going to spend on presents to a worthy cause. Just once... just one year. Because presents don't really matter, right?  I'll tell you this. Not one of you will do it. Not a single one. And I don't really have to say why... but I will. Because Christmas IS about presents and that is all. Period. End of story. You can tell me it's about baby what's-his-nuts all you like but if they suddenly disappeared from view, you'd be fine so long as you got the game cube or that leather jacket or that hardcore japanese porn. Go on and tell me it's about good will toward men.... then tell me what you've done if anything at all. Tell me it's about love and family and togetherness and you might have me there for a min. But I know of a similar holiday that  doesn't  have corporate sponsorship. It's called Thanksgiving.  Without your precious presents, your Christmas is just another cold December morning.

Of course, back then only white male landowners had an unalienable right to vote â but the differences run deeper than this.  In the original Constitution, including the first ten amendments (the Bill of Rights), provisions were in place for the election of a House of Representatives, a Senate, and a set of Executive Officers (President and Vice President). However, of these three, the people (white males, in this case) were only allowed to directly elect members of the House. The Electoral College is a vague concept to us nowadays, and during most Presidential election years the College is referred to simply as âvotes,â since an entire stateâs number of electoral votes goes to the winner of the popular election in that state. This system, however, is only due to state statues that force the Electoral College representatives from each state to cast their votes in accordance to the popular vote.  As things originally stood, the public would vote for Electoral College members, who themselves would then meet and cast their own votes to determine the Presidency.  A similar system was in place for the Senate, where each individual State legislature was responsible for casting the votes for the U.S. Senators. The voting system for the U.S. Senate stayed in place until 1913, when the 17th Amendment passed the voting power to the general public. And as we all know from the FUBARâd Presidential election a few years back, no amount of state statues will change the fact that our President is still chosen by an Electorate.  So why bring all of this history up? Especially on the eve of another New Yearâs Rockinâ Eve with the seemingly eternal Dick Clark (who at this point must be drinking the blood of babies to keep his face wrinkle-free)? Because I was sitting at my desk trying to think of amusing anecdotes to add to a possible âYear That Was!â retrospective for Beer Nâ Porn, and I realized that there really wasnât anything of interest to report.  Nothingâs changed.  Hell, when I mean nothing, I mean nothing. Our economy is still in the tubes. Weâre still at war in Afghanistan. Thereâs still hostile combat taking place in Iraq. We still donât have Osama bin Laden. The government is still excelling at taking away the rights of its citizens. The executive branch is still corrupt. The Office of Homeland Security continues to be the biggest waste of resources in the history of the United States, and thatâs saying something considering weâre the country responsible for the SUV and the old Styrofoam McDonaldâs containers (remember those?) Our FBI is charged with protecting domestic air traffic, yet canât even subdue a hysterical soccer mom. Donât believe me?  urlLink Read the story yourself . The CIA, once able to tear down entire governments with a single well-placed rumor and a few well-aimed bullets, now canât even keep the names of their lower-level operatives secret. Again, urlLink  read the story yourself .   Hell, even the counter-resistance hasnât changed. Social unrest comes in waves, and just like the ocean, each one looks the same. You could take the denim-clad, black hair, black-rimmed eyeglass wearinâ hipster emo liberal eco-friendly protester from today and swap him out with a long hair psychedelic flower-wavinâ LSD-dropping hippie from the late 60âs and theyâd be saying the same damn clichÃ©d catch phrases. Forty years pass between our old Vietnam and our new one, enough time for a generation or two to pop out and learn how to walk and talk, and still each side stays the same. The governmentâs still busted, the people are still stupid, the protestors say the same damn things, and nothing ever changes.  When I was growing up, there was an old run-down factory on my side of town that had a long red brick wall that was always a ripe target for graffiti. For the longest time while I was growing up, there was a large anarchy âAâ written in white paint with the words âIMPEACH BUSH!â written nearby. When I made it to high school, the words were crossed out and in their place someone wrote âIMPEACH CLINTON!â Ten years later, and almost written right over the old letters, âIMPEACH BUSH!â blares out again in Krylon glory. Apparently, Bob Dylan got it wrong. The times, in fact, are not aâchanginâ. Theyâre staying the same.  People clamor for the President to be removed from office. People in California clamor for their governor to be removed, and lo and behold, they were successful. Here in my home state of Connecticut, weâve already removed two mayors for corruption, and weâre working up steam to get rid of our Governor for trading government contracts for a new hot tub. The Nintendo generation apparently canât even wait for each election year to violently overturn the government. Itâs becoming standard operating procedure to vote someone in to office, then complain about âem and kick their sorry butts out.  Our Democracy works like the Gong Show used to be.  As I sit here, thirteen hours before the New Year, I leave you all with my own conclusion about the year that was. Perhaps the Founding Fathers had it right. If thereâs one thing that weâve all learned in the past year, itâs that people are tremendously, colossally stupid. Not individuals, mind you. Individuals can be smart, resourceful, caring and kind. But when individuals get together, they become people, or crowds, or political parties, or religions â and at that point, thereâs no limit to how amazingly stupid they can be. Democracy, while the government of choice in my book, seems to have the unnatural ability to not only allow stupidity to foster, but to allow it to grow and become strong until it is a blight on the survival of the society. Perhaps itâs not such a good idea that our fellow men (and women) should have such a say in who runs the show. Next time youâre in Wal-Mart or KFC, take a look around you â those people are the ones running this country. Scary, huh?  So, I have a message for the people of the world on this night.  Deal with your own fuckinâ stupidity.  Deal with the fact that you voted for an imbecile for Governor/President/Senator, etc.  Deal with the fact that the problems of the world are your fault. Deal with the fact that your belief system is responsible for the suffering of others.  Deal with the fact that you are probably part of a greater association of extremely stupid people making extremely stupid decisions about phenomenally petty things.  If I had my way, I would make elections public. Each individual should have to go on record with whom they voted for. Then that way, when their elected official passes laws or executive orders, the people who voted for that person can be affected first.  Letâs see how fast the people wise up to their decisions when theyâre the first ones to empty their wallets to pay for money lost to corruption, the first to give up their rights to the will of the majority, or the first to pick up a M-16 and fight in some Godforsaken desert three thousand miles from home.  Happy New Year, sheep.  - Mr. Carson   --------------------------------------------------------  Hey everyone, back for another scorching?  Nah Just kidding, this time itâs nothing but my two cents on the whole New Yearâs thing.  So 2003 is ending, lots of things have happened (Wow, that sounds like I took it right out of George W Bushâs mouth didnât it?), some good, some bad.   The following went good this year: â¢	I turned 21.   This has to be the best part about this year. I mean, I am selfish sometimes so this has to rank on high.  Plus the kick-ass celebration my friends threw for me was great. Hey anytime a guy gets jumped by three hot chicks has to be a good time! â¢	Return of the King.  Good god, what we had been waiting years to see finally culminated on December 17th.  My sleep cycle has been fucked up since then, and itâs worth it. Iâve seen it twice so far, which is scant few compared to some of my friends.   All I have to say is Pelennor Fieldsâ¦ good god. â¢	Apartment. 	There is nothing more liberating than agreeing with your parents that it is time to move out of the house.  Unsettling as all hell is what it really is.  I spent the first three months in this apartment by myself, cause my roommates had other commitments during the summer. I know Santa cried because the son was moving out of the North Pole to stake his own claim on the world.  But I must say, living by adult rules when youâre 20 puts a few things into perspective, like the need to save money, and other stuff kids donât think about. Fucking teenagersâ¦ â¢	I discovered Pool.	I had always enjoyed playing a game of pool when I was a kid, whether is was after a league round of bowling or wherever I saw a table, but the pool bug didnât really bite me until about September this year.  I started becoming a voracious student, trying my best to learn how to play this game.  I have books, my parents supported me by getting me my own cues, and if I know that thereâs pool on ESPN, itâs almost impossible to pull me away, especially the Trick Shot competitions.  And if youâre going to laugh because Iâve chosen billiards as a serious hobby, just remember, I could be doing crack on the side of the road instead. â¢	SpikeTV.	About fucking time.  This is the best idea for the TV sinceâ¦ well the TV.  I canât talk enough about the praises of this station.  Itâs got Bond Movies, American Gladiators, Slamball, and thereâs usually something blowing up on the station, all of which are awesome.  Real Men of Genius, we Salute you, Mr. SpikeTV inventor. â¢	We went to war.	Now before you get out the crucifixes, hold up.  As terrible as war is, sometimes it does have a boon on the economy.  Come on, we wouldnât have gotten out of the Great Depression as quickly as we did if it were not for Trigger Happy Germany and Kamikaze Japan.  We go to war, we have to make lots of stuff which in turn creates lots of jobs, while our men are going out to war, and our women stepped up in a big way in WW2 and helped the war effort by leaving the kitchen and going to work.  Money starts flowing in a big way in our nation and thus our economy starts booming again. Think of it this way, we went to war and our economy started improving. Now do I think killing everyone we see just because they donât agree with us is a good thing? No way, but it did some good.  And, just because I got your attention, hereâs a list of the things that went bad. â¢	We went to war.	Now I know what youâre thinking right now.  Didnât I just say that us going to war was a good thing?  Well, yes. Iâm also saying itâs one of the bad things that happened this year.  War is never cool, unless itâs in a computer, and even computers are getting to the graphical point of mimicking entry and exit wounds in bullets, explosion effects from bombs and whatnot. (I think when it hits that point itâs going to be insane) Now, I understand our motivations: Dubya is just finishing the job that his daddy didnât do.  Has anyone even heard of Osama Bin Laden lately?  Come on people, donât be that stupid.  Iâm going to get off my soapbox on this in a minute, but let me say this:  The wool is over our eyes.  We took our shitty domestic squabbling and political positioning and hid it all away while Bush went off on his wars, fueled by the words âterroristâ and âWeapons of Mass Destruction.â  Now that weâve even gone so far as to capture that bastard, have we found any, and I mean ANY Weapons of Mass Destruction?  No, of course not.  Pull back the veil from your eyes and see what exists.  Through political manipulation of intelligence, we went to war, and killed many, many people.  And after âMission accomplishedâ weâve lost more Americans than in the actual war.  Someone I knew from High School is dead from this conflict.  Do I pity him? No. It was his choice, and he knew the risks.  Do I wish he was around? Of course, Iâm not that heartless.  Just open your eyes; War is the best double-edged sword in existence. â¢	The Matrix Sequels.  Wachowski Brothers, What the fuck were you doing? First movie, awesome.  Second one, Train wreck.  Third One, Flashy, but didnât have a lot of soul in it.  Ok, letâs break it down on The Matrix Reloaded.  Very cool premise, lots of pretty special effects, but unfortunately special effects alone donât make a good movie, you needed a lot more development.  Still enjoyed watching it, but didnât get out of it what I thought I would.  Score:  C+.   The Matrix Revolutions, the answer to all the riddles, right?  WRONG!  That movie created more questions than answers.  Plus with all of the inferred plot from the shitty shitty dialogue the movie boiled down into a Special FX bonanza.  Also enjoyed watching it, but I was looking for more meat in the dialogues. Maybe I was looking for a message, and maybe the clowns really are not scary.  Score: C. Biggest issue, once you tell someone that they are the next JC, and JC can do all kinds of freaky cool stuff, then the movie turns into a version of Superman. â¢	Reality TV.	Itâs time to cut the bullshit on this stuff.  Survivor has gone on long enough.  Who cares anymore? It was novel when it was first thought up, and just like the Real World, it has turned into a seething cesspool totally losing the original concept.  (Nothingâs better than the original, Star Wars: The Phantom Menace and both Matrix sequels proved that)  Fear Factor?  Was a good idea. I enjoyed watching people do things that I couldnât bear to do myself.  Time for these shows to go the way of the dodo and die off like the miserable pieces of shit they are. I never once watched Survivor, and the craze around it was borderline hysteria. â¢	Friends.	Even the best shows need to end.  Look at Cheers.  If you think Friends doesnât need to end, experience something new, go jump off an airplane and fly through a fire hoop at 100 miles per hour before pulling the chute.  Sitcoms have shelf lives, they cannot go on forever. Simpsons, Iâm looking at you as well.  Now I usually wouldnât say what a colossal geek I am and be a fan of Babylon 5, but it works out nicely here.  Hereâs a saga that told its story, ran its course, and ended on a high note.  None of this âletâs see how long we can string the series alongâ¦ letâs give one of the main characters triplets! That would be so awesome!â crap. Long shows need to end.  Let new blood come and let the old episodes be released on DVD. â¢	The Popeâs Health.	Once again, hold off on the crucifixesâ¦  I mean no harm.  The Popeâs health has been failing, which sucks.  Now having said that, I donât understand the desire to put him out like a puppet for all to see and revere. *Voice over* Yes, be spiritual, and you can be held up by Godâs graces long after your body has told your soul, âLook, Iâm done, go back to Heaven.â * I honestly think the man is more spiritual than anyone and done as much as he can to correct the wrongs of his predecessors and forge new paths to peace, but just like the sitcoms, he should be allowed to step aside and die in spiritual peace.  Itâs just like why we keep someone alive long after itâs clear they are suffering more than living.  If I ever get so bad that I canât function, there will be no life support, there will be no rest home. I will live as I always have and when itâs my time to face the eternal judge, Iâll argue as hard as I can for a good life, but when itâs my time, itâs my time.  I think itâs the Popeâs time.  Let John Paul II rest.  Thatâs my deal with 2003.  Goodbye and I hope to see you in â04  Burning up the old, reborn in the newâ¦  -- Jake ""The Phoenix"" Kozak",male,24,Internet,Aries,0
378436,1510754,2004-07-01,"I am Pop Culture   	I am an American.  I know what it is like to be free and expect these freedoms to be protected by the government chosen by me.  These said freedoms allow me to be who I want to be, say what I want to say, live how I want to live, and play how I want to play.  No one has the power to take my freedoms away from me, unless I do something against these protected freedoms.  If I kill another man, I am still allowed to be represented by an attorney.  I am read the Miranda and shoved to the floor (harshly) because I have gone against the code of society established by Thomas Jefferson, George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, and Homer Simpson.  Homer Simpson?!  What?!  This fictional character, created by one of the most influential cartoonists ever, next to Schultz, Davis, Watterson, Parker & Stone, Judd, and Disney, has the power of the founding fathers?  Most definitelyâ¦  	The majority of todayâs culture does not follow the examples led by our elected leaders, the people who keep our country strong and worth fighting for.  But then again, what do we fight for? Iâll tell you.  	We fight for Pop culture.   		 	Pop culture allows our feeble minds to understand the complexities the children of our past would have been taught at the age of five, if not sooner.  Pop culture gives the regular Joe Shmo the power to quote Shakespeare at the drop of a hat.  Pop culture provides a person with the âintelligenceâ to give a lecture on a complex mathematical formula, or write an eighty-page dissertation on the art of war and growing technology.  Pop culture teaches a four-year-old child to question the existence of God and Santa Clause because of their favorite movie.  These arenât necessarily bad results, but are the means a credible way to learn?  Does it really matter where one gets their information, as long as they have the information?  Since the general populous learns these complexities from Pop culture, and most of the time, incompletely, will our society be affected by it?  Has perception already been altered?    	A Collage:  All I need to know about life I learned from questionable resources.  		I learned Hamlet, III.i, from a notorious âBad Boyâ of SNL.   		I learned the general concept of entropy and âchaos theoryâ from a man whose claim to fame was dressing up as a giant bug in a movie that made me think twice about looking through my medicine cabinet. 		I learned there is a disease research facility in New Hampshire with the capability to destroy mankind from a story about the apocalypse, a man who plays with fire, and Abigail Freeman.   		I learned there are five classes or tornados from a man who made me laugh in âAliensâ and a woman who made me cry in âAs Good as it Gets.â   		I learned hundreds of philosophical theories from a man with a hat overlooking a fence as he explained them to a man with the intelligence of a Binford 5000 power drill.   		I learned there is a Santa Clause from a letter written in a newspaper to a small girl.  . 		I learned there is no Santa Clause from a Kay Bee toy advertisement in a newspaper.   		I learned an African-American boxer was once framed for murder in a song by a man playing the harmonica and smokinâ a bowl.   		I learned Ebenezer Scrooge wanted the biggest turkey in the window from a film starring Austin Powersâ father and a collection of foam puppets.   		I learned the puffer fish could be poisonous, when eaten, from Homerâs Jayâs near death experience.   		I learned about the consequences of whaling from two futuristic astronauts on a wild trek through the heavens.   		I learned the supposed hierarchal organization of angels in the afterlife from a man who owns a New Jersey comic book store. 		I learned Edward the Longshanks of England was a bastard for a king from Mad Max.   		I learned pornography is an art form from an unexpected visit to a particular website when trying to research ârooster fights.â    		I learnedâ¦I learnedâ¦the tip of the iceberg.  		Perhaps it is OK to be filled with valid information from questionable resources.  Perhaps it is good enough to be able to formulate an opinion on a certain subject by basing it on what we have heard in a song, seen in a movie, or read somewhere.  Perhaps this is all fine and dandy.  But look at the result.  Power lies with fiction and embellishment.  âBraveheartâ is not an exact account of Edward the Longshankâs actions, but many will assume what they see as 100% true.  âThe Simpsonâsâ have entertained us for years with clever anecdotes and witty referential one-liners that make us laugh because we think we know what they are talking about.  No one is as smart as the media, and no one can avoid being exposed to misnomers and bent truths.  	 		The world no longer listens to the President or his cabinet anymore.

378437,1510754,2004-07-01,"This guest writer (and hopefully soon-to-be regular contributer) I met at a plastic table in a tiny room in the bowels of south campus one scorching sumnmer afternoon. We were there for a summer job and this was to be the first of many nearly pointless meetings. He was rocking back and forth and talking 1,000 miles an hour to a group of young woman at his table - That's right -  his  table. He'd made it his somehow. We've grown to become good friends since that day. I've come to know him to be one of the most unique and honest human beings I've had the pleasure of meeting. Ram Subramanian Iyer, ladies and gentlemen.   And now, for no particular reason, the Canadian Flag and national anthem... (please stand and remove your caps)     O Canada! Our home and native land! True patriot love in all thy sons command.  With glowing hearts we see thee rise, The True North strong and free!  From far and wide, O Canada, we stand on guard for thee.  God keep our land glorious and free! O Canada, we stand on guard for thee.  O Canada, we stand on guard for thee.   Sign the guestbook, you wonderful canuks! :::tear:::      This one's a doesy... hold on to your life.... ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------    Manifesto    One night I ran out of excuses as to why I couldnât make a difference.  Just like many of my friends I often complained about how the corporate world manipulates the United Statesâ politics in order to fatten its own bank accounts at the cost of culture and life elsewhere in the world, allowing for human rights atrocities across the world and in the United States committed in the name of the American Dream.  Perhaps an example would help.  One does not have to look too far into the past to find evidence of the United Stateâs governmentâs two handed approach.  With the current war in Iraq, declared finished, but with a rising death toll, the Bush and Blair governments breached many fundamental principles of the United Nations, beginning with waging war without the approval of other permanent members, each with its own politico-economical agenda and international human rights violations problems.  Furthermore, weapons of mass destruction are yet to be found.  Not to mention, the extremely lucrative oil and infrastructure contracts are being handed to Halliburton with motions to block other contributing nations from receiving contracts.  And the best progress of freedom of speech and expression in New Iraq: incarceration of Iraqi workers (shipyard workers and other infrastructure personnel who found themselves without employment when the very government that paid them was laid to rest) without counsel for organizing strikes to protest the placement of foreign nationals in positions rightfully theirs.    The end result of all this international bureaucratic skullduggery and war-mongering is this: the American public can have a wonderful, quasi-peaceful life, while their days away at the nearest Mall heedless of the real depth of woe and misery surrounding the very comforts they adorn their houses with, happy with the odiously biased, obnoxiously repetitive tripe on television misnamed news.  In addition, the about face in social values concerning video game and violence in the film industry is astounding but expected in the face of rising propaganda in US television networks â everything from once abhorred violent video games now packaged under âgood defeats evilâ war games to advertisements selling the thrill of flying for the air force by comparing it to extreme sports is being aggressively marketed to music from current formula rock hits bopping a recruiting-age generation.      The only answer I can find to the question why the American public is not out in droves protesting the perversion of the very constitutional rights their children have taken for granted is that we are conveniently distracted by the innumerable array of gadgets and devices and âfashionâ thrown at us, neatly packaged under Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Yearâs, Easter, Spring, and Summer Sales, complete with people lined up for five dollar off coupons at six a.m. in the blistering cold, thank you very much proletariat America that hides under the name of middle class.  And to those of you who find this material quite familiar but havenât done anything about it, go fuck yourself.  Or do something.  And if you donât like my language, allow me to make it clear that Iâm only as pretty as your pretensions of friendship and respect for the boss whose job you envy.  Because being boss usually means telling someone else what to do.    Understand that I was and am one among you; only, I decided to sit down and think my problems out.  Hence this manifesto.  That you are reading this line is testimony to the fact that I, Ram Subramanian Iyer, have done something about sights so familiar, they are now simply offensive.  I am just another ordinary person working a job to pay the bills, trying to get an education, and with an avid interest in filmmaking but with no access to methods of distribution or production involving a lot of money or saying something I donât really want to simply to get my foot in the door; only, all these days, I was blaming the System, the Government, the Media, that beautifully orchestrated three ring circus show replete with in flight Jacuzzis, Asian masseuses who go the extra mile, and a whole shit load of cocaine and speed thatâs bad for the masses but never questioned at major contributorsâ parties.  Iâm tired of the hypocrisy, the conniving, the posturing.  I was blaming these people not worth half a thought for keeping me down, for telling me what to say or not to say, while coolly enjoying my comforts and a lifestyle that these very real social power-houses dictate.  Now, I will no longer run after comforts that I know for a fact, after having done research, cause someone else pain.  I do not want to contribute to this system anymore.  Iâm tired of being taken advantage of, mentally and physically, tired of my voice being shit on, and deathly afraid of losing my history to apathy.    And what about you who might be just like me?  An ordinary person with a job, a goal, and something to say regardless of how:  perhaps you are a writer, a poet, a thinker, a filmmaker, a musician, a photographer, trapped by the very need for money to produce amazing looking, high budget, extremely bureaucratic, industry driven, profit making products at the expense of your vision and true Voice?  You who do not want to bow to the expectations and limitations put on your form and content because someone else does not deem it appropriate for public consumption, heedless to the fact that it is that very public among whom you live, who motivate your need to create? You who, just like I, despise the glamour, the glitter, the meaningless notions of individuality and freedom sold in Abercrombie catalogs?  We who know a life and a world and a bias those controlling and helping control 51% of the world's wealth will never know or acknowledge or do so only to point a finger.  Children of parents who know what it is to move to a different country with a thousand dollars and four mouths to feed?  Children whose parents walked three miles in dead winter to work at a pizza place because their qualifications are from a different country, and we all gotta hustle.  You, I, we, who have stood with our parents in the six a.m. lines not because they loved a good sale, because thatâs how they kept us decently clothed.  Children who know what handouts are anyway, and learn to discriminate real early between a handout and a sincere act of kindness.  Who refuse to give up principles for a more convenient lifestyle based largely on systematic scape-goating and laziness.  Who have nothing but a will to succeed and refuse to blindly support an economy at the cost of someone else's well being.  Who are tired of people telling us we speak good English.  Do we?  Well then.  We are the people who prefer the dust shimmering off an old book languishing in some attic for a sincere touch to pry open a whole world of ideas over industry-processed political puppetry.  Who will hear what we have to say about why the system works?  Who will know what it is to be an I, an Us?    I know this much.  I will not claim to be a helpless minority any more.  Numbers will not replace Us; I will no longer be a generic Them.  I am the socially disempowered.  I come in many colours, flavours, hairstyles, tattoos, piercings, and names.  You can call us spics, rics, kykes, chinks, japs, niggers, honkies, towelheads, fags, dykes, punks, jocks, or any other term in this ultra-sensitive assortment of lexical refinery, which, by the by, most dictionaries pretend do not exist; shit, you can even invent names for me.  We are not fazed by intellectual midgets.  We have grown beyond mere name-calling.  We will all be doomed by our inaction, no matter what strata of classification we belong to.  We are the voices that will shriek our sentence.  We have to be heard.  And we cannot do it by becoming corporate fodder, ready for the harvesting.  We will have to become truly an army of one.  We do not need a multi-billion dollar budget filtered through plastic-smile and eau-de-cologne bureaucracy to support us.  We are the foul stench and harsh reality being filtered.  We will not kowtow to inconsistency and complacency.  Our expectations are different.  We are not satisfied with the comforts of modern America, not when they are being bought with lives, regardless of whose or where.  I have never taken life and I DO NOT want to pay for what I have not taken. We are tired of ignorance and democracy paid for by campaign contributions with the best interests of the corporate world in mind.  We are sensible to the fact that our tax dollars which keep this machine running are somewhere along the line involved in somebodyâs death and misery. We will take our constitutional rights serious, with heed to the fact that rights are bound with responsibilities.  We will end corporate hegemony over our everyday lives.  Once and for all.  HOW?  The answer lies in the corporate world itself.  In those very coupons.  In those very superfast, supsersmall devices we get sold everyday that we donât need.  Perhaps you should consider harnessing the energy of glitz and glamour and gift giving this holiday season, or any other season for that matter, towards a better cause: Dissemination of Information and Expression through any Modes Available or Preferred.  If you have something to say, just say it is the basic premise.  Itâs time to stop talking about the injustices and inequalities of the world; take some action, take some initiative, for fuckâs sake, get a Voice and let the world know you exist.  Tell âem you will not spend the rest of your already-bleak looking life like the limp old neighborhood dog that every kid torments but nobody remembers after it dies.  Because if you never let the world hear you, tell the world you thought, it all dies with you.  And you will have lived for nothing.  In fact, it would have been as if you never even existed.  So letâs give the historians and political scientists along with a smattering of linguists, humanists, and perhaps even psychologists, something write about.  We can re-direct the course of your future history books.    So buy them 100 count CD-R/RW packs by the dozen and videotapes and super fast burners and âgreat deal on any Gateway computer this holiday seasonâsâ and use all this shit they throw at you to distribute what you have to say.  Every event in your thinking life is history in the making if you make the appropriate causal connections.  So write your history, sing about it, make a film on it, document it with the 3.2 megapixel digital fancy-ass super-duper-deal-on-refurbished-items camera and use your pirated copy of Photoshop to layer a picture of you taking a dump on your worst corporate nightmare.  Then take the ultra-cool-and-patriotic Hewlett-Packard all-in-one printer from Staples with a $17.00 instant rebate and $60.00 manufacturerâs mail-in rebate to task on recycled sheets from the garbage at your work place where thousands of pages a week are thrown away with only one side printed.  As a last step, gather a group of friends, or even alone, distribute your expression.  Distribute those CDs, those tapes, copies of your photography, or any other documentation of injustice and inequality, including but not limited to obscure information, body counts, vital statistics of world economies, biased laws and entrapping clauses.  Break it down.  All this information can be found on reliable resources online like Reuters and Associated Press, the White Houseâs official website, and the Library of Congressâ website (great for access to legal mumbo-jumbo); subscribe to other reliable sources of information and dissent online, in schools and communities.  Do not be afraid to talk to people about taking initiative.  Do not let embarrassment or shyness overwhelm the need to disseminate your brainchild to strangers; take pride in your work.  Explain to them why you are doing it; be gentle and fair with your explanation, and ALWAYS be sensible to proper decorum and decency.  If it helps, include a copy of this manifesto with your work; reuse/recycle paper and use up unprinted sides.    Make use of the great deals on web-hosting and domain registration to build a website chronicling your achievements in mass distribution; linking to the site while distributing your material is bound to get you traffic.  The point is, whether or not a monumental change occurs, you would have done everything in your power to scream your stance.  A single act of dissent is more constructive than getting drunk with your friends and complaining about how the Man keeps you down.  The Man is a fabrication in this day and age; the system tells you you need it;  I am telling you, you donât.  The Man can be bypassed, and now you know how.  Do not just espouse a view; live it.  SPREAD THE AWARENESS.  Albert Camus wrote, âI no longer wish to be happy now, just to be aware.â   Whatever you do, do not die on your history.  You owe it to circumstance.  It has dictated just about everything that has happened to you; but you, to some extent, can make circumstance happen for somebody.  You may open someoneâs eyes.  You may let someone know he or she is not alone.  You may give the hobo across the street comfort in pissing his pants because itâs too cold to pull his dick out.  Please, do not laugh at him.  Feed him.  Learn from him.  He knows more than you about circumstance.    So say something, any which way.  The key is in mass distribution.  Hereâs where the corporate world can be reamed a new asshole.  The more we buy, the cheaper their shit gets.  Let the money-makers and war-mongerers pay for your media.  Ever wonder why it is in this super-competitive economy that businesses can afford such ridiculous sales?  Because some body else in some other country is getting dirt pay and even less respect and human dignity.  So buy, and buy, and buy, and pay little to nothing and DISTRIBUTE.  For free.  I do not know about you, but I VALUE my intellectual integrity, and take pride in sharing my vision with people.  I cannot bring myself to put merely a PRICE on my work; I will not cheapen all the things that I owe my entity to.  I hope you harbor similar sentiments. Make a name for yourself, make a statement, reach somebody.  And you donât need ask a damn soul for help.  You donât need an agent or an art exhibit or a distributor or some scum-bucket politician with an embezzlement problem to flash his empty title to endorse your point of view.  If you truly believe you have something to say, you donât need intermediaries.  The people are waiting to hear what you have to say.  Itâs time to say it.  Nobody can claim to find you.  You have found yourself.  Say it loud, say it proud, till every motherfucker in the house knows what the hell you are about.  People will listen for your sincerity and intellectual testament is probably the most financially and socially sound deal your audience would have been offered.   While the world sleeps, we rumble.   -- Ram S. Iyer",male,24,Internet,Aries,0
378438,1510754,2004-07-01,"*** Dexter's Holiday Spectacular! ***  Happy Holiday's to you and yours. Another Christmas is here and I'm in bed with a fever in a pool of my own filth.  I'll say again - to hell with Christmas.  For now, though, I hope you enjoy whatever this is. I wrote it on Christmas Eve in between curling up on the floor and listening to Santa and the elves doing Christmas Rap in my head... yeah... I was really really sick...  ---------------------------------------------------------   DexterAML: I am away from my sanity right now     the dubious world of the random IM â a beginnerâs guide    Iâm sitting here at home alternately shivering and sweating from fever. I canât swallow, I canât breathe, Iâm coughing up blood, and, worst of all, I cannot get online.  It occurs to me between hallucinations how much I rely on instant messenger programs for keeping in touch. And, of course, between hallucinations that got me thinking about all the annoying crap that invariably comes with something so useful.   Itâs happened to just about all of us. Youâre sitting at your PC looking for some quality porn and chatting it up with a couple of friends who are likely doing the same. Or hell, maybe youâre just reading a strongbad e-mail or buying Scandinavian coasters with gold trim from eBay.   Whatever.   Suddenly a message pops up tagged with a screen name that youâre unfamiliar with. You read the name once, the again, then a third time slowly â still no clue who it is. Then, if youâre particularly curious, you ask around to a few folk on our IM list. Granted, if the name is something like HornEwhore22, you can be pretty sure that the person on the other end isnât looking to strike up kosher conversation. Other times, though, the name is harmless ( Starcrunch72  or  SmurfDance55 ) and weâre all just a bit curious as to who it is. â Did so-and-so change their screen name and not tell me ?â â Have I forgotten who this person is? â â Is someone playing a prank on me ?â On and on like that in our heads until we ultimately decide to act. And Iâve heard a million different versions of what follows next. The random name is ignored or blocked. Random IMer harasses with an endless barrage of ethnic slurs and threats of a virus. Cyber-nookie is offered. Or, worst of all, they beg youâre your âpicâ  . Rarely, though, the person is someone you know or is just a friendly stranger. Most times, however, theyâre just assholes who need to be taught a lesson.    What do you do? How do you stop them? Can they really give you a virus? What the hell is going on?   Well kids, Iâm the recipient of these whatnot IMâs and  I always accept them. Always.  No â they can not âgiveâ you a virus or in any other way hurt you unless you let them.  Donât click on their links or accept anything that they try to send you - ever.  Itâs never good. You CAN be hurt and annoyed by visiting certain websites â so donât. Also  NEVER volunteer any information , ever. After that, youâre all set! No clicking, no downloading, and no sharing anything more than a first nameâ¦ bingo! The stage is set! This means youâre in control of the conversation from this point on. DO what you like! Demand a name and block them when they refuse. When people IM me with mysterious crap and know my name and all that tomfoolery, I am not impressed. Iâm provoked to blockâ¦ which I do. These bastards usually turn out to be people I know using different screen names. I donât have the time. However, if youâre REALLY lucky, youâll get someone who right off the bat youâll know is a stranger. In my opinion, at this point, one can choose to be a victim or to be amused. If theyâre an asshole go for the throat and if theyâre just a friendly stranger, then youâll be amused anyway. I talk with them and, most times, theyâre assholes who provide me with 10 min of jollies. God bless you, Mr. Random IMer. Youâre the source of my salvation on many a boring evening.    Not sure what Iâm talking about, kids? Hmmm. Maybe an example is in order. Check out the following. I got a random IM from  missworks2much23  who apparently wanted to show me some dirty and naughty images of her poontang (thatâs vagina for you D&D fellas). Instead of cringing or, worse yet, clicking on the link like a moron, I chatted her up. And when she tried to cyber-rape me, I gave her a good reason to get off of her digital knees. This is an honest-to-goodness REAL IM conversation between me and an unknown skank.  Letâs watchâ¦         missworks2much23 : hi... anyone tere?    Drew : Howdy   Drew : how goes?   missworks2much23 : oh your tthere hi...    Drew : Hi    missworks2much23 : a/s/l (age sex loation)?    missworks2much23 : :)   Drew : 23/m/CT   Drew : likewise, asl   missworks2much23 : im 27/f/USA. was lookin at your profile. thought you might like to chat.     Not bad so far, eh? â âSheâ is just looking to chat. What could possibly go wrong?     missworks2much23 : so what have you been up to dexteeraml?    Drew : http://beernporn.blogspot.com/    missworks2much23 : :)   Drew : it's a blog - my friends and I vent about social ills   missworks2much23 : ool. i was just hangin out watching tv. i was getting kinda horny (*blushes)    Drew : it happens   Ok â warning sign number one. This bitch doesnât want to chat. She wants some cyber-nookie. Better let her down slowâ¦     missworks2much23 : feel like a litttle cyber fun with me ? please please...     I give her no response â likely I was talking with someone else on IMâ¦    missworks2much23 : i think ill just take that as a yes.... being as that im starting to get real horny here.. lol ok?    Drew : Begging will get you everywhere... except there, love - sorry... I have some integrity, shoddy though it may be   missworks2much23 : was just browsing the profiile thing. looked like you might be an interesting person to chat with.    Drew : I appreciate the offer - sincerely   missworks2much23 : alright how bout i get down on my knees in front of you and help yoou out of your pants?     Ok... I tried being nice to her â I said no. Had to go for the package, did ya? Well thenâ¦ I think itâs clear That sheâs left me no other optionâ¦     Drew : Were my genitals not a turgid mass of open sores and weeping warts, I'd oblige you   missworks2much23 : tell me what you want me to do with you ehile i slip out of my panties    Drew : First, I'd like to find a suitable doctor who can prescribe the appropriate medication that I may be cured of this foul condition   missworks2much23 : oh yeah babe.. dont stop. whilee i slide my hand down between my legs and part my moist lips    Drew : I cringe at the unexpected smell wafting from your voluptuous tropical opening   Drew : Sweat beads beneath the dense hair on my back   missworks2much23 : i have some pics on my homepage the link is inmy profile, still working on it ...     Ahhhâ¦ so now weâre clear. She doesnât want my cyber-moneyshot. She wants my credit card number. Heh. I know how to handle these hoesâ¦     missworks2much23 : oh it feeels so good. Im holding your pulsing cock in my hand, my shiny red fingernails dig gently into your balls, while my full, soft lips engulf the mass of your meat    Drew : I adjust my glasses and use your underwear to staunch the sickening flow of disease that is my groin   missworks2much23 : open my website so you can look at me while im sucking you. use the link iin my profile!    Drew : I swipe at the mucous that has congealed beneath my massive nose   missworks2much23 : what do you think of my picss?    Drew : I wipe it on your face as a token of friendship and ecstasy   missworks2much23 : shit the phone. donnt stop stroking it. hold on...    Drew : I am over-eager - I vomit on your soft pink lady-bush   Drew : I rush to the nearest exit sans pants   Drew : I contact the police and hang myself from the basketball rim hanging in your paved garage   [end]   See? Simple and easy! Granted, I got a little creative near the end for kicks. That was gravy. But she left and I didnât even have to block her. In fact, sheâs likely blocked ME! Ainât life grand? :-D  Sometimes, though, they arenât just after your digital ding-dong or your wallet. Other times theyâre annoying teens who want your picture and, subsequently want to cyber-date, screw, whatever. Christâ¦. These tramps also get no love from me.  Darkstarr6969  met the Dexter RIGHT AFTER  missworks2much23  fled the scene. It was amazing. I was already in a playful mood and, once she started asking for my âpicâ I brought down the hammer. One again, this is a genuine conversation between me and some dude/chick.      Letâs watchâ¦         darkstar6969 : hello   Drew : Howdy   darkstar6969 : how are you   Drew : Decent - yourself?   darkstar6969 : good   darkstar6969 : thx   Drew : I'm assuming this random IM is supposed to spur my curiosity, thus, leading me to seek out your undoubtedly tempting profile which, if I may be so bold, is certain to be wrought with perilous links of all sorts   darkstar6969 : ok   darkstar6969 : well just looking to chat   darkstar6969 : is that so bad   Drew : certainly not     Maybe Iâm wrongâ¦ maybe she/he just wants to chat a bitâ¦     darkstar6969 : ok   darkstar6969 : so   darkstar6969 : how are you   darkstar6969 : do you have a pic?    strike oneâ¦     Drew : ...who are you?    darkstar6969 : i am steph   Drew : a suitably genderless name   darkstar6969 : ok   darkstar6969 : you have a pic    strike twoâ¦     Drew : http://beernporn.blogspot.com/   darkstar6969 : what is this   Drew : it is me in text form   darkstar6969 : ok so where ois your pic   Drew : Do you not see?! - I've just given you a view into the sanctum that is my soul   Drew : feast and be merry   darkstar6969 : lol   Drew : arise from your throne of discontentment!   darkstar6969 : ok it is nice   darkstar6969 : but do you have a pic   darkstar6969 : i am a lil lost   Drew : Is that not enough? - What digital representation could possibly equal the unabashed splendor that is my soul woven through naked revelation?   darkstar6969 : ok well i guess you dont have one   darkstar6969 : no reason to beat around the bush'    strike threeâ¦I tried to be niceâ¦ she wants a âpicâ of Dexter? Here it isâ¦     Drew : Dig my monster sausage   darkstar6969 : what   Drew : I beat children   darkstar6969 : you dont   darkstar6969 : i am thinking you are a little wierd   Drew : Is it wrong to ponder the flavor of innocence?   darkstar6969 : you are so sick   Drew : To fondle the ass of a 10 year old boy?   Drew : You deny what you so richly deserve   darkstar6969 : you are so sick you need to be put away   Drew : they cannot fight back   Drew : this I know   Drew : Do you have any kids?   darkstar6969 : this i am not telling you    Drew : I'm a child care professional - I swear   Drew : leave them in my trust   darkstar6969 : you need help you sick bastard   Drew : Because I enjoy youth?   darkstar6969 : you enjoy them in a sick way   Drew : What way is that?   Drew : You tell me here and now that you do not not desire to be locked in a passionate embrace with a toddler  bubbling processed carrots?   Drew : You, ma'am have no soul to speak of   darkstar6969 : you are fucking sick   Drew : Her name is actually Emily   Drew : she likes to fish, swim and skate    Get it? HAHAHAHAHAHAHAâ¦     darkstar6969 : children are precious gifts you don not have sexual realtions   Drew : You obviously don't have children   darkstar6969 : you are so twisted   Drew : Twisted like my fist amidst the supple virgin flesh that is their anus   Drew : *drool*     Alright â Iâve edited out about 30-40 lines of conversation that are essentially the same thing. I talk about doing terrible things to children and she says ""You're sick"". I think she may have been masturbating to it or something. Anyway amazingly she doesnât go awayâ¦ SHE KEEPS TALKING TO ME! Why? Who caresâ¦ Iâm enjoying it. Time to shift gears a bit...      Drew : and if you were honest with yourself, you'd accept some of the blame as well, young lady   Drew : don' t be so quick to shirk your responsibilities   darkstar6969 : what are you talking about   Drew : Come off it you harpy temptress! Would you honestly have me believe that you did not have this planned from the very start?   Drew : Luring me into your trust and baiting me with smooth erotic cherubs?   Drew : I've filed this conversation and am taking appropriate action - rest assured... the police will be notified within the hour   darkstar6969 : I ALREADY NOTIFIED THEM OF YOU   Drew : Doubtful   darkstar6969 : I AM A HEAD OF YOU YOU SICK BASTARD'   Drew : I can smell your bitch-fear from here    Hereâs where I go for the knockout punchâ¦ Iâm bored and I donât win my little game unless she goes awayâ¦ I dig DEEP. Donât expect this to make much senseâ¦     Drew : I want you inside me   darkstar6969 : stop you are so sick   Drew : I want to dip your braids in wax while you vomit in my face   Drew : it's the only way I can get off   Drew : tell me that you love me - I must hear it once more   darkstar6969 : fuck you    darkstar6969 : sick bastard   Drew : once more for the police report, my love   Drew : you're only strengthening my case - pedophiles like you shall no longer have reign over those innocent children   darkstar6969 : what are you talking about   darkstar6969 : i did not do anything   Drew : How long will you perpetrate your evils behind the monitor?   Drew : step out into the light - Jesus is waiting   Drew : and he has a shitload of valuable prizes!!!!!!!!!   darkstar6969 : the only mistake i made was talking to you leave me alone   Drew : I'd appreciate it if you'd stop hitting on me - clearly I'm not available nor am I of the tender age after which you are clearly seeking   Drew : The police have been notified   Drew : ...Heil Hitler   [end]   A little pedophilia and that hoochie heads for the hills. NO muss, NO fuss! And, hell, I had an awesome time.  Itâs all about realizing that youâre in control. End the conversation by blocking them â period. Donât entertain their hogwash. (Though, if this concept is news to you then you may be beyond help.) And for those of you with a pair, have fun! Abuse right back! They arenât prepared for it and itâll likely get you blocked! Sweet, eh? No more IMâs from cyber-skanks or lonely teenage douche-bags! HOT SHIT! Whatâs more, you have fun. So get out there and stand up to those cyber punks! Youâll be more than happy that you did. In the meantime I can't feel my arms and my face is awash in equal parts tacky sweat and mucous, and, during the writing of this, I had a full on conversation with my dog... who wasn't even in the room at the time. I'm gonna go take some drugs and pass out - g'night all.   --Dexter Otis Green  :::hack, cough:::",male,24,Internet,Aries,0

378440,1510754,2004-07-01,"Stop this bus, I want to get on - 12/23/03   My commute to work every day takes me through a residential neighborhood, a classic New England street near a lake frozen over and still in the December air. This is an organic block, with the houses facing willy-nilly and in all sorts of shapes and sizes. Two story colonials, one-story starter houses, made of wood and brick and Bob Vila-approved vinyl siding, some with garages and some with sheds, some with broken-down cars littering their gravel stone driveways. This isnât one of those pre-fab neighborhoods, where all the houses look the same and every yard has the same single sapling planted in the strategic spot in their barely-there front yard, just enough in front to raise the property value but far enough to the right to keep the view from the bay window free. Nope. These houses were built individually, by different contractors and different architects, and each has their own unique and endearing character.    Normally, I manage to get my lazy ass out of bed before 7 AM, which gets me on the way to work well before the school buses start picking up kids. Last week, however, I slept in, and on my mad dash in to work I found myself stuck behind one of those lumbering yellow monstrosities as it worked its way through rural Farmington picking up students.  Now I consider myself a patient man, and only give in to road rage when it is completely justified (people cutting you off, failing to observe signs and traffic signals, police that feel the need to tailgate you in the left hand lane without their flashers on, those bastards). But I was two seconds from going nuclear once I realized that this bus was stopping at every other house to make pickups. Every other house. The road I was on was a half mile in length, at most. The furthest any of these kids would have had to walk to get to a hypothetical bus stop was a quarter mile. Whatâs that, a five-minute walk? Nope, sorry, this bus was stopping at every single driveway for every single little brat kid.  I hate to sound like some stereotypical old man on this, but didnât we all have to walk our sorry butts through the snow and ice to our neighborhood bus stop when we were snot-nosed third graders? There was none of this front-door concierge service when I was growing up. There was one stop for every two to three block radius, and that was it. And as much as it sucked when it was snowing or raining, wasnât the bus stop a cool-ass place to hang out? All the neighborhood kids together without parental supervision, with just enough time before the bus came to raise some quality childhood hell.   This certainly wasnât the case this fateful morning. Traffic was backed up all the way up and down the street because of the front door service the bus was offering. It amazed me what a wasteful system this was, not only for the traffic and the time involved, but for the parents who were stuck watching their kids at each stop. Why not have one stop, like we used to do, and have one parent each day rotate in to watch the little brats? Instead, each parent had to wait for their kid to be picked up every day before they could get back to their daily routine, whether it be go to work, clean up house, sleep with the milkman, etc. All the cars stalled, all the parents interrupted, and the bus taking close to an hour to finish its route. Things looked about as efficient as a Soviet supermarket.  It seems like our society is getting into trouble with our antiseptic lifestyle choices. The bus stop saga is just a metaphor for how disconnected weâve all become from each other. I guarantee you the reason why the bus had to stop at each house was because the neighbors didnât know each other well enough to trust them with their kids. Rather than take the time and effort to get to know each other, to develop the strong bonds of community that allow cooperation to occur, weâd rather petition the school district to pick up everyone right at their door. Never mind the dangers that might befall our kids as they walk three houses down to the communal bus stop. What kind of world do we live in when you canât feel safe letting your kid walk around your own neighborhood?  That sounds like a paranoid statement to make, doesnât it? Thatâs the way our society works nowadays. People are paranoid and skeptical for absolutely no reason. I guarantee you that the neighborhood I was driving in that day hadnât seen a violent crime committed in decades. The problem is, peopleâs perceptions are defined more by the 10 oâclock news than their own experiences. Why not extend a friendly invitation to the neighborhood, get to know everyone and confirm for yourself that the surroundings are friendly? No such luck, I suppose.   Add on top of this our fanatical obsession with safety and cleanliness. God forbid our sons and daughters trip on their way to the bus stop and skin their knees, right? Weâre raising our offspring in plastic bubbles, where theyâre force fed bottled water, made to breathe purified air, forced to swim in chlorinated pools and made to clean themselves with abrasive chemicals and nonspecific antibiotics. From birth weâre forcing them to live on crutches made of HEPA filters and amoxicillin, and theyâre no better for it. Incidences of asthma and life-threatening allergies are on the rise in the United States, and many scientists believe that this is directly related to the way we are raising our children. Granted, most parents assume that they are doing whatâs right for their children, but since when do you have to pass an aptitude test to become a parent?   Weâre stuck with a nation of shrink-wrapped, sanitized children with their umbilical cords still attached, forcing the system to work for each individual while eschewing the community at large. Unfortunately, we have every right as American citizens to stick our middle finger up at the world and refuse to interact. But when everything from medicine to government to even the busses have to make that proverbial stop at every individual house, how can there ever be enough time to take care of everyoneâs needs?  Itâs time we bring the bus stops back. If not for any of these grandiose reasons, just so I can get to work on time without getting stuck behind some bus picking up your brat child.  -Mr. Carson",male,24,Internet,Aries,0
378441,1510754,2004-07-01,"Updates and Assorted Sundries - 12/22/03   My goodness has there been some commotion here at the worldwide headquarters of Beer âNâ Porn! I turn away for a few days and when I come back I find more guys have stuck their stuff up in here than in Jenna Jameson. I feel dirty and used, like the box of Kleenex on your nightstand. AND WHERE THE HELL ARE OUR OTHER âOFFICIALâ MEMBERS AT? Don? Jeff the â---â? Ladies and Gentlemen, we have lost all semblance of order here. At least our new guerilla bloggers are doing their best to keep up the BnP standard of quality that we all have come to know and love. Namely, eschewing all attempts at cohesive expository structure in favor of random sexual innuendo, profanity and pathological humor.  And by the way, since when do we have a wreath on our official logo? Let me remind the audience that the snazzy BnP logo was designed by Mr. Dexter himself, who only a few weeks prior stated clearly on this site that he hates all things Christmas. Dramatic Irony? Or simple pandering to the audience? Regardless, I see a disturbing lack of guestbook posts from any of the great countries of Scandanavia. FINLAND! I'm talking to you, buddy.  Before I get down to it, a few updates:  First, the results of last weekâs poll. Winning in a landslide for âBest Middle East Spring Break Spotâ was that rockinâ little slice of Iraqi paradise, the six-foot hole outside of Tikrit!     Boasting a small sitting area and a severe infestation of rodents and bugs, the six-foot hole attracts tens of thousands of spring breakers each year from colleges around the country. When asked what draws so many people to this dank den of despair each year, students from Texas A&M responded, âThe importance of this site in our nationâs history, of course. That and the bitches in Tikrit put out!â Early in the coming year, Playboy plans on issuing a special Spring Break edition of its magazine, focusing on the wild and raucous parties that rock the hole each year. Playboyâs publisher, Hugh Hefner, claims to have nude photos of First Lady Laura Bush dancing the ââPon de Riverâ with Donald Rumsfeld during last springâs wet T-shirt contest, and plans on publishing those in the spring break issue.   Coming in as a ridiculously distant second place is both Tel Aviv, Israel, and Kabul, Afghanistan. Tel Aviv, while previously claiming the Middle East spring break popularity trophy, has seen a decline in interest over the past few years since the initialization of widespread military reprisals from the Sharon Administration for Palestinian terrorist attacks, along with the closing of the local Hard Rock restaurant famous for having Tiny Timâs ukulele on display. Kabul is in the midst of a rebirth in popularity, as the U.S. military continues to bomb the bejeezus out of everything in sight to make up for its inability to find Osama bin Laden. For more info, check out the  urlLink Survival Guide to Kabul  â your resource for finding the best in Kabul nightlife!  Sadly, receiving no votes whatsoever were Tehran, Iran, and Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Tehran has been trying desperately for years to improve its tourism image, but little things keep getting in the way, that little hostage snafu a few years back. Not surprisingly, no one wants to visit Riyadh for vacations, because as we all know Saudi Arabia serves as the epicenter for theocratic terrorist organizations throughout the area.  Sadly, thatâs no joke. Where do you think bin Laden made all his contacts and financial connections?  Check out this weekâs subversive poll, and make sure to leave comments! We here at Beer âNâ Porn want to hear the voice of the electorate!  Secondly, I have sad news to report. I diligently checked and re-checked the books here at the Beer âNâ Porn accounting department, just like any responsible member of Enron or the Connecticut state Executive Branch would, and I still see a lack of accounts receivable.

Hold on to your fur, kids...  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   SUVâs, Ditches, and You: A love story    Last weekend brought the second true snowstorm of the year, and though the roads were in their usual shitty condition, covered with snow and slush and sleet and ice, I was out there. I was driving through the madness, making my way determinedly through the mess and muck.  âAre you a mailman?â some may ask. I say âNo.â Some may even think I drive an SUV, with their fancy four wheel drive and bigger engines, to force themselves across the icy roads.  Nope, no SUV either.  Not to say that they werenât out there. As I slogged my way through the wintry wastes, I saw SUV after SUV pass me on the highway, their drivers believing blindly that the magic of four wheel drive would save them from the powers of that great physical force, Inertia.   Amusingly enough, I saw more SUVs and trucks than cars on the side of the road, covered in snow, or trying to get themselves out of a ditch that their careless driving had slid them into.   No, friends, I do not drive an SUV. I donât drive a truck. I donât have four wheel drive, and, frankly, I donât want it. I drive a 1989 Plymouth Horizon â a small hatchback with a 2.2L engine that pulls the carâs svelte 845 lb. frame along. I think Lewis Black did a bit on the Horizon once, but I donât think he had a very charitable opinion on the matter.  This car has the snow traction of Wile E. Coyote with a banana peel under his feet â that is to say, very little, if any at all. Itâs light and relatively powerful for its size, which doesnât bode well when you donât want the car to slide or the wheels to spin. Hit the gas a bit too hard, and the wheels spin in place, sending a flume of snow from the front tires. Try and turn too sharply on an icy road, and youâll slide off the road like the four year old girl at figure skating lessons for the first time. Try and drive over some snow thatâs any deeper than nine inches or so, and the car will likely strand itself on the snow like a beached whale, the tires unable to reach the ground.  Sounds like fun, huh?  Some people may be thinking to themselves, âIf you are driving in the snow so much, why donât you just get a truck/SUV/dogsled?â Four wheel drive and more weight should help you be safer in the snow, right?  As the cars in the ditches might tell you, four wheel drive doesnât make up for stupidity.  This is a big problem facing us these days â dipshits with SUVs and driversâ licenses. Iâm not really complaining about any of the usual issues that people associate with the vehicles â low gas mileage, low safety, consumer indulgence, etc etc. Iâm not an activist and I see no real gain in pissing and moaning about how they waste so much gasoline and they take up too much space. I just laugh when I fill up my gas tank for $15, and the gauge on their pump is at $38 and still counting.  Essentially, Iâm complaining about bad drivers. Iâm complaining about people who pay $25,000, $30,000, or more on a car, and then expect this behemoth to take care of them when the snow comes around. Four wheel drive means itâs good in the snow, right? Theyâre also the first ones to point out all of the fancy schmancy technological advances that were included in the car that helps them in the snow. I could write three thousand pages on how much I despise the arrogance that is fog lamps (but that is for another time).  Snow driving is a very difficult task that requires a lot of practice and preparation. I spent a lot of time my first winter learning about how cars move in the snow, and how to counteract the carâs motion when it starts to slide. Granted, I spent most of the time doing donuts in the parking lot at my high school, but I practiced until I felt comfortable with it. Most people who buy SUVs assume that with the scented floor mats they get a security blanket, and theyâre always the ones who are surprised when they end up with their chariot lying sidewise in a ditch on the side of the highway, waiting for the tow truck to drag it home for them.   This merely illustrates an issue I have with American consumerist and materialist culture. The idea that a better piece of equipment will automatically make you capable of things you could not previously do pervades a great chunk of the marketing and advertising that you face every day.   Our athletic shoes will let you jump like Michael Jordan. Our baseball bat will let you hit like Barry Bonds. Our gloves will let you catch like Ichiro Suzuki. Our car will let you drive like Michael Andretti. Our computer will make your kid smarter.  Itâs all bullshit. Those athletic shoes are no better than foot covers if you weigh 300 lbs. That baseball bat it still just an expensive piece of firewood to Grandpa. That glove is just an ex-cow if you have the hand-eye coordination of a blind wombat. That Porche will still slide into a ditch if you take a corner too quickly. And that computer is useless if your kid doesnât study as it is. Heâs just gonna be watching three second clips of porn and reading subversive stuff that some yahoos have been posting online - hey, kinda like this!  So, when I do things, I eschew that expensive equipment. I play paintball - I have a lower end marker. I still do rather well. I ski. I bought used equipment, and it works perfectly. and I love to drive in the snow and other times - with a car that I bought from my father for $400.  Next time you think about getting into a new pastime or picking up a new hobby, spend more time working on the basics and technical skills required, and spend less money on unnecessary equipment. Become better at what you do than contribute to the crap thatâs foisted on us all the time.  Peace.   --Sasquatch",male,24,Internet,Aries,0

Like a phoenix rising from the ashes, so did I the day of and after my birthday.  (In case you canât figure it out yet, Iâm the person Dexterâs December 8 article is about)  I figured it would be appropriate to discuss something thatâs been irritating the hell out of me with people lately.  What I am referring to, of course, is personal responsibility. Now, why is it that I have decided to bitch about this? Was it Dexterâs talk about the yummy scrumptious babies that happen when people finish coitus? Was it the old rant on God is and does He or She exist?  Well, itâs a combination of the two, complete with my own beer-battered, deep-fried, baked and blended two cents to add to the mix.  Now, I realize I havenât said anything about it right now, and I would say that I am to blame for that. Iâm the one writing it, so itâs my fault.  There, personal responsibility.  People nowadays are completely unwilling to own up to their own actions.  In the Corporate world, look no further than Enron, the entire board denies any wrongdoing even when the evidence is thrown right in their faces.  In more recent news, take a look at Martha Stewart. That bitch damn well knew she was engaging in insider trading and still she denies that she did anything wrong.  HELLO, someone high in a company tells you something that will make or break a company, and you do something with your holdings, suck it up Martha, I hope your fellow inmates will show you the true meaning of a âChristmas Bouquet.â  Because of the fact that everyone sees these huge corporations dodging social responsibility, they assume that they can lie, cheat, and steal.  Letâs look at what goes on deep in the realm of Springerdom, where Ricki, and Montel, and Jerry are the lords and ladies of some perverted oligarchy where the rampant unprotected sex produces more kids than Michael Jackson could ever hope to molest. Now Iâm not saying that the unprotected sex is the problem, like I said, Iâm talking about personal responsibility.  It doesnât pain me to see that children are being born in this world âby accident,â whether the condom broke, she missed a pill, or the phone rang and startled you when you were going to pull out. What bothers me about the whole thing is that the guys sometimes deny that the kid is theirs (because, letâs face it folks, the women are da hoes, right?) or that even if they acknowledge that it is their child, they refuse to take care of him for whatever reason.  Thatâs the bitch.  Seriously, how the hell can you call yourself any form of human when you damn well know that you caused a life to come into the world, and then choose not to take care of it?  I thought exposing was a relic from Ancient Greece.  Weâre no longer physically exposing our unwanted kids to the elements, killing the undesired off, the ones we do allow into the world are being exposed socially and emotionally.  I donât think I could have made it 21 years without both of my parents. Does that make me weak? Maybe.  However, with all seriousness, take care of your fucking kids. Thereâs nothing more irresponsible than not taking care of one of your own that you caused.  Parents, donât think you arenât falling under the knife tonight.  Parents are letting their kids get out of control.  They are YOUR children. Now Iâm not advocating abusing kids, but I know that through discipline I learned how to take care of myself in the world. (I can just hear the bleeding hearts now about how I got spanked as a kid.  Get over it. I deserved every one.)  And some advice to parents:  The television is not a babysitter!  Donât just plop little Timmy down in front of the boob tube while you go out. The flashing images on the TV is no replacement for taking little Johnny to the store with YOU, even if he is a whiny little bastard and an embarrassment to you when you canât control him after YOU have pumped enough sugar in him that he could cause avalanches with the sound of his screams.  Simply put, YOU are responsible for your kids, because they donât know any better, and nor will they know any better unless YOU show them the way.  Letâs go back to me for a second, âcause Iâm not immune to this either.  A couple of Saturdays ago my friends got me absolutely stumbling drunk and all that to celebrate my 21st birthday.  Now, letâs say for a minute that something happened that day and I ended up in the hospital, or worse, dead.  Now, I in the hospital on life support from breaking ribs from vomiting so hard and having the shards cut through my stomach would undoubtedly suck ass, so Iâm glad I avoided such an extreme fate.  All I had to show for it was being carried to my bed by my friends, and them wondering if Iâd be ok.  (See the Dec. 8 article for the details)  The point is that they didnât tell me to do anything I wasnât already in the mindset to do. Hence, if I were to have gotten hurt, thereâs no one to blame except for me.  They (meaning my friends) put me in that environment, but I was definitely the one who ultimately decided to go with it.  Ergo, even if I did blame them for my getting hurt (which I wasnât) the blame still lies with me, because I did it of my own free will. I donât buy this whole âI was drunk so whatever I did shouldnât countâ shit.  If you were stupid enough to drink so much that you did something really stupid, then you need to own up to it. In fact, any of the things that I did that I felt bad about on my birthday the appropriate people and authorities have been apologized to.  What am I getting at?  Does this kid ever shut up?  Yes, very soon.   This whole diatribe is about one thing: Owning up to your own actions.  Donât start blaming others when things go to shit.  Not every bad thing that happens to someone is a conspiracy by the Martian Council to fuck up John Q Publicâs life.  Iâm not saying we all should be angels, but if you fucked up, and youâre called on it, then stop the bullshit and own up to it, and face the consequences.  And if youâve just read this whole thing and are disgusted by it, you have no one to blame but yourself.  âTil I rise from the ashes againâ¦  --Jake ""The Phoenix"" Kozak",male,24,Internet,Aries,0

Itâs been written about at least sixty thousand times (in sixty-thousand term papers, newspapers, and English papers) by authorâs who are no older than last weekâs âYo mamma so fatâ jokes. Somehow they feel that they can buck against the norm and become some quasi-hippie coolness guru by being opposed to the concept of coolness altogether while simultaneously showing mom that she canât rule their lives by shifting their little underdeveloped social âgearsâ into reverse and lashing out against everything and everyone that has the slightest tinge of âtrendyâ.

Fuck off. If I were to insult a Jew (or anyone for that matter), Iâd be a shitload more bitter and creative. Itâs as if weâre only allowed to use marshmallow words.   Television is certainly no help. Letâs ignore the talk shows with their herded audiences screaming about morality and decency to neo-fascist transgender Satan worshipers and focus a bit on these court shows. What kind of madness is this? Didnât we create enough uneducated justice nuts in the days when Judge Wapner wielded the gavel? Now we want to pour more losers into the mix by bringing in a host of newer psuedo-judges? And is it me or is it a requirement to have a 19 in metal rod jammed deep into oneâs ass before he/she/it can host one of these âshowsâ? Judge Mills Lane apparently took one too many on the chin and hasnât âleft the ringâ and Iâd venture to guess that Judge Judy was never hugged by her dad as a childâ¦. well maybe a special âsausageâ hug.

Back to the pointâ¦  Somehow weâve spawned a new breed of opinionless zombies who worship their televisions and their children. Donât judge! Donât offend! Donât assert!

378445,1510754,2004-07-01,"Children: Natureâs ultimate prank    Sex. Itâs been all the rage for centuries - two people, two sets of throbbing genitalia, two steamy sweaty bodies longing to satisfy a deep primal urge slapping together in a crazy 2/4 rhythm - bitter to some and all too familiar to others. We build our television and radio shows around it. We dress in hopes of getting it. We even have establishments that are more or less specifically designed to help you get your freak on with one or more of their many skanky patrons. Hell, we even have a nearly inexhaustible supply of euphemisms for intercourse- doing it, making it, hittinâ it, beating it up, giving it, getting it, banging, âhomeâ, Fucking, shagging, humping, the horizontal mambo, the horizontal bop, making love, riding the bologna pony, burying the purple headed warrior, going âall the wayâ, screwing, getting laid, scoring, and my personal favorite, doinâ tha nasty (awwww yeah)â¦ you get the picture.   Today Iâll skip the sarcasm and get right to the point.   Drew is pissed about unprotected premarital sex.  In 1995, more teens left Hartfordâs Weaver High School with babies then diplomas. In my family alone, I have 5 or 6 nephews and nieces (not to mention the one on the way) and my oldest sibling is 24 and unmarried. All of these (scrumptious) babies making (tantalizing) babies, screwing like rabbits to prove their love or their masculinity and not one has the brainpower to scrounge up a condom, a pill, a diaphragm or even a cold shower. âIt doesnât feel the sameâ and all those other bullshit excuses for avoiding protection donât fly well with me. Babies (yummy) canât be tucked back into the vagina like so much undone casserole. These kids are being born to parents who wanted nothing more than a lilâ bit oâ nookie. Hell, half of YOU may have started out as a hardon and some naughty fingers in the back of a volkswagon.   Iâll let you all in on a little secret.   Sex = (delicious) babies.      Iâll give the slower folk time to catch onâ¦   â¦there you go.  âWhoa there, Drew! Sex isnât just about making (mouth-watering) babies. Itâs an intimate expression of love. Hell sometimes itâs just a great way to unwind! I think youâre over simplifying this âsexâ thing.â  â¦  ummmâ¦   â¦:::middle finger:::  The primary function of sex, although it may be about love or what have you at times, is to âmake (scrumptious) babiesâ. Thatâs the only thing about sex that is constant. (Ok, granted, homosexuals would beg to differ with me on this one and, well, I canât really disagree. For the purpose of this rant, though, Iâm gonna focus on the heteros).   Humans have been trying to find ways around this âproblemâ for centuries. Weâve tried everything from different food combinations, cloth sacs, ritual chants and dances to the more modern condoms, diaphragms, and injections to get all the pleasure of sex without running into that pesky (finger-licking good) baby problem. Unfortunately none of these methods are 100% effective - especially when the people employing them use them improperly. Câmon, kidsâ¦ how hard can an anti-fertility dance be for the traditional moron? Shake, shake, dip, spin, THEN stomp!! And be sure to employ the TRADITIONAL form maracas instead of these fiberglass plastic hybrids. They arenât nearly as effective as their balsa wood cousins.   AIDS is more attractive than abstinence, it seems. The cessation of sexual activity elicits the same response as voluntary castration.  ""Sweet Jesus! How do you expect me to live without my precious precious tang!â  or  âMother of God! I need the wang all up in my junk at least 3 times a day or Iâll go mad! MAD I TELLS YA!â  The elephant man has better odds with a nationally televised three-way with Terry Hatcher and some unnamed soccer mom than I do of convincing goddamn horny teens to simply keep their friggin' pants on. There are hundredsâ¦ nay, THOUSANDS of things lovers can do without penetration. Get creative, junior. Youâll keep yourself dandily Un-daddified and frankly, sheâll appreciate your love all the more if itâs not running down her leg.   Vaginal intercourse ISNâT the ultimate in Freakology 101.   ...Trust meâ¦ itâs all about the tongue.  â¦but I digress.   You donât want (tangy) babies? Donât want to be faced with the possibility of an abortion or giving your kid up for adotion?   Stop Fucking. Period.  âBut Dexter, surely you jest! Why Iâll bet that you are probably running the streets with your pants around your ankles as we speak! How dare you judge me when you are guilty of the same crime!â  Hate to disappoint you, slim, but, barring some creative advances in science, thereâs no way that (delectable) babies are popping out of my hole of choice. And, by the by, when I was laying down with that special lady someone I understood (on some level) the consequences. I wouldnât have been surprised that she got pregnant no matter how careful we had been (I myself was born despite birth control - mama on the pill and daddy using a condom. Take that, Trojan.). If she had ended up pregnant, believe you me, Iâll be the last one chanting âabortionâ which, by the way, is conveniently becoming synonymous with âcondomâ.   Radio announcer:  To lazy and horny to slap on a rubber? NO PROBLEM! Dr. Flushimout will take care of that pesky unwanted (savory) baby lickety split! Rayâs Abortion Clinic! No fetus can beat us!   Listen I donât doubt that some abortions save the life of the mother and are thereby ânecessaryâ but I find it hard to believe that all women who have abortions do so because their lives are in jeopardy. I wonât dare say that the men havenât an equal part in that act as well but thatâs an entirely different story. In the end, taking more responsibility for where your wang goes (or what wang goes in you) would make the abortion thing less of an issue.  (Iâm not gonna get into the whole debate on abortion. Itâs gotten more use than a new inmateâs hole.

No fetus can beat us indeed!... âspecially with merlot.)    My final word? Sex = babies. Donât let your hardon and irresponsibility ruin your life or the life of some innocent (spicy, sweet, tangy, tasty) baby.  You donât want kids? Hereâs a clue....

Much to my surprise, there was Dan Rather with a crazed look in his eye saying,   âWe got him!â    âHallelujah! We got A-Rod!"" I thought.  Oops.  So the Great American Military-Industrial Complex has finally succeeded in catching Saddam Hussein. Just for the record, the United States Armed Forces are the most technologically advanced fighting force in the world. Hussein is a 66-year-old man who was hiding in a six-foot hole. For some reason, locating him took nine months, untold billions of dollars and 313 American soldiersâ lives. The operation to capture this senior citizen from his foxhole took 600 infantry and members of a special ops brigade.  Six hundred American soldiers for one old man?  Astounding.  I refuse to consider this capture a victory for the Bush administration. Itâs a lucky break, and donât be surprised when this administration milks it for all itâs worth. The capture of Hussein is going to be used as a public relations trump card that the Executive Branch will use to strong-arm increased spending allocations through Congress and force the U.N. to adopt Dubya-approved resolutions concerning the future of Iraq and the awarding of reconstruction bids. Worst of all, to millions of Americans, Hussein has become the symbol of the 9/11 attacks, and Bush will sell his capture photos to the heartland of this country as a sign that the war against terror has finally been won. Heâll wave his smoke and mirrors in our eyes and claim that the war is over, wanting you to forget that Osama bin Laden is still missing, Afghanistan is in complete disarray and the American Military is in complete shambles.   ((Uncontrollable Liberal Rage))  I suppose itâs a good thing in a cosmic sense that Saddamâs in custody. Never mind that the U.S. supported Saddam during his rise to power and during the Iran/Iraq warâ¦((rage building anew))â¦but I reserve my anger for the sake of the Iraqis. Hopefully this will help turn the tide of public opinion between the Tigris and Euphrates from âletâs blow the fuck outta the Infidels!â to âYay Americans! We love Krispy Kreme!â Although Iâm still a bit skeptic. If you watch the cable news feeds of downtown Baghdad, you see the Iraqis celebrating at the news of Saddamâs capture. Werenât these the exact same crowds protesting the occupying forces only days ago? I donât like the idea of my friends and family stuck halfway across the world in a country full of intellectual preschoolers with rocket-propelled grenades â Saddam or no Saddam.  I still think the best answer to the whole debacle would be to build a Great Wall of concrete and steel around the entire Middle East â the âgreaterâ Middle East, mind you. From India and Pakistan (yeah you, with your freakinâ Kashmir fights and mini-nuclear holocaust waiting to happen), all the way to Israel and Palestine. Heck, throw Turkey in there for kicks! Donât think we donât see through your ruses, Istanbul! We noticed how you conveniently agreed to help out during Bush War II â by immediately stationing armored divisions in the Kurdish hills, where (surprise surprise!) a number of lucrative oil fields are stationed. You guys looking to take some oil and kill some Kurds? Well then join the fun! Welcome to the new Middle East.  One big wall, fourteen-odd countries. Let âem fight it out once and for all. I am 95% convinced that these people will never ever be able to live peacefully together in any amount of cohabitated space. So why bother fighting it? Let âem have it all out in the largest steel-cage grudge match ever. Let Vince McMahon and Jerry Lawler cover it for pay-per-view. The advertising rights would be worth billions. And this whole Middle East madness can be settled, once and for all.  Iâm tired of watching Americans die for other peoplesâ petty wars.  I sign off with an anecdote. A good friend of mine in high school had a voracious appetite. Often times my little group of friends would spend the weekends on the Connecticut shore, which always meant a stop off at Lenny and Joeâs for some fried fish. Lenny and Joeâs serves food in two sizes â huge and JESUS-MARY-AND-JOSEPH-THATâS-A-LOTTA-SCROD. Which makes no sense considering their large sodas are the size of thimbles.  But I digress.  My friend loved his fried fish. More importantly, he loved his fried fish with a ton of French Fries. He would truck that food like a champ, and while my friends and I certainly werenât shy when it came to scarfinâ some shrimp, he had us beaten hands down in terms of speed and efficiency. That platter didnât stand a chance when he came to the plate.  The trick is, my friend had heartburn. Bad heartburn. Pathological heartburn. Water gave him heartburn. A warm summer breeze would give him heartburn. Heartburn so bad it would render him incapable of rational thought. One would think that such gastric disturbances would force him to be a little more discriminating with his eating habits, right?  Fuck no! This is America!  He would carry around with him at all times a jumbo bottle of Pepto-Bismol, the top-shelf stuff that they only let you take two or three times a day. He would sit down in front of his trough of fish, practically inhale it, and wait a few minutes until the heartburn hit. There he would be, writhing in pain, doubled over in front of his car and looking for all the world like he was about to projectile vomit into the ionosphere. But then, like some suburban Clint Eastwood, he would pull the Pepto bottle from his pocket like a Colt .45, pop off the top, and drink half the contents. One minute of pain, one massive burp, and bingo, no sweat, he was fine again â ready for another plate of fried fish.  I would ask him why he would do this to himself. Why purposefully overeat when he knew that his stomach would give him hell for it later? It was abusive. His answer?  âYou canât eat fried fish in small portions, dude.â  â¦  I submit that there is nothing so uniquely American as consuming more than your body can handle, for the simple fact that  you can .  I love this country.  P.S. â Donât let anyone feed you bullshit about âUnder Godâ being an essential part of the Pledge of Allegiance. That was added in the â50s as a response to international communism, when the U.S. was looking for ways to stand in opposition to the Red Tide. Why? Because the Communist state disavows organized religion. Therefore, to oppose the godless Commies, we started teaching our kids that our country had the blessing of God. Linking God to Democracy was nothing more that a subtle foreign policy maneuver.  Iâm sure the Baby Jesus appreciated it.  -Mr. Carson",male,24,Internet,Aries,0

Itâs almost always off or not on your person. Even when itâs on, you never answer it. Your cell phone is a status symbolâ¦ not a means of communication. You constantly fondle it in your pocket like some monstrous clitoris. You download a million different ring tonesâ¦ all of them queer and all of them annoying as all hell that we get to hear each and every time you get a call.  Beethoven's 5th? - Pick up your goddamn phone. I hope you choke on your leather cases and your ever changing face plates. You screen your calls like youâre a goddamn celebrity. Youâll only answer your cell phone when you barely have service and youâre driving 90 at night in a blizzard with a car full of screaming children with the windows down. No one understands a word your saying. We call back but you donât answer. You never answer. Ever.   Loser.   Your cell phone has hundreds of features - and for the most part you are clueless to their existence. It wouldnât matter if you were aware of them because you wouldnât use them anyway. Features are something to talk about when you wave your cell phone around like some grotesque detachable electronic gonad. You donât store numbers. You donât use the calendar. You have zero use for that goddamn camera, I can assure you. And, most annoying of all, you never check you goddamn voice mail. Ever. We leave you messages but you never check them. And even when you DO check them, you donât call back.

378450,1510754,2004-07-01,"Wait a minuteâ¦ this sounds like rock and/or rollâ¦    	Nothing like turning on Mtv to watch some good old fashioned music videosâ¦. Oh wait.  There's too many TV shows on Mtv to play videos anymore.  But that's been a problem since I was in high schoolâ¦ not to worryâ¦ VH1 still plays videos, right?  Son of aâ¦ they don't play videos either.  These aren't music channels anymore, they're lifestyle channels.  That's bullshit, my friendsâ¦ pop music is a dark and evil force that I hate to the ends of the earth, and the worst part about it isâ¦ I hate myself for thinking this way.    	Why, you ask?  Simply put, I'm becoming my parents, just like they became theirs.  Let's preface this argument with a brief caveat.  Most new music is bad.  MOSTâ¦ not all.  There are bands out there (Radiohead, I'm looking at you) that are really, terribly talented and are breaking new ground with music.  And even Radiohead started out as a one hit wonder to be on Mtv with 'Creep""  but they transcended pop and really made something of themselves.  Like the Beatles, the Stones and the Doors did.  They each had their seasons as pop heartthrobs, on covers of tiger beat magazineâ¦ and managed to bust past that for a general audience appeal.  And a timeless quality that lets youngins like me enjoy them.    	Now, you may think I'm sort of classic rock snob.  I assure you, 'm not, although it is my first love, and it's the kind of relationship you remember for all times.  I'm also a big fan of countryâ¦ NOT contemporary countryâ¦ Rapâ¦ OLD SCHOOLâ¦ gospelâ¦ NOT contemporary gospelâ¦ starting to see a pattern?  It seems like I'm stuck in the past, right?  Which is where I get the lingering guilt of being born a generation late.    	I can't help but wonder if there's some band out there that I'm simply not listening to because I'm biased against their style of music.  I mean, let's face it folks, in thirty years, they're gonna be playing nirvana and Tag-team back to back on the oldies station.  Our coming of age music will become softened, and acceptable, and OLD.  Old people hum Benny Goodman tunes now?  When we're them, we'll be humming the melody licks to ""lose yourself"" by Eminem (another notable exception in the world of modern musicâ¦ a lyrical monster, and a true talent in this dark age.)  	But which bands are going to define the here and now?  Try as I might, I can't believe the likes of nickleback and uncle Kracker are gonna be in it for the long haulâ¦ then I remember that they're tomorrow's forgotten 45s.    	At least we have 90s retro to look forward to.  It takes 20 years for things to be cool again, these daysâ¦ look at the 90s themselvesâ¦ the first 70s stations had started popping up, dazed and confused was outâ¦ 20 years gone, and it was back.  70s shows started playing on nick at niteâ¦ the 70s had become history.  And now, at the dawn of the 21st century, the 80s are once again coming forth in all their glammed up, synthed out, coked up glory. I love the 80s on vh1, 80s lunch hours, 80s stars coming back to haunt us and run for governorâ¦ like a large karmic wheel.  	But let's pop in the WayBac machine for just a short time, and think about the eightiesâ¦ they don't fit my retro chic formula.  The 80s were like the foul opposite of the 60s.  This logical disconnect annoys me, because my theories are like my children, or my favorite actions figures that I line up to fight Cobra commander (fuck yeah, GI Joe).  I don't like it when there are glaring inconsistencies, although they are present more often than not.  I just ignore them and hum a little song to myself.  SO I offer the theory of why the eighties and previous generations didn't do what the past 20 years have doneâ¦ it's simple.  The 80s were the last original generation.  Ok, okâ¦ the 70s kind of ripped off the 60s a little bit, but we'll forgive them that, right?  So the nineties and the aughts are all about remixing and samplingâ¦ what does that say about my theory for when the 2010s show upâ¦ it'll be 90s retro, which is in turn 70s retroâ¦ and that is why the Mayans predicted the end of the world in 2012â¦ because the double retro loophole will tear a hole in the space time continuum.  And we'll all go through the black hole and end up on a nice abstract island floating somewhere in andromeda.  Lemme tell you, I'm looking forward to it, because I bet the Andromedans have a music channel that actually plays music videos.   --The Slater",male,24,Internet,Aries,0

I've been after this particular fella for about 8 months now and it's about damn time he agreed to add his scrawlings to our potlock blog. His name is The Slater.... dark poet and guitar player extrodinaire. How'd I get the slacker to post? I gave him a random topic and in 15 minutes he beats out this piece of work and, Sweet Jesus, it's a doosey. Keep your eyes open for more work from ""The Slater"". Meanwhile, enjoy this tidbit.  ----------------------   Where have all the gentleman farmers gone?   Ever find yourself wondering HOW cold Canada could really be in the winter?  No, no, Iâm not going to defect to the Land of Loose Morals that lies to our north, despite its even-tempered laid-backedness and its free health care.  But the fact that some days I yearn for the clean streets and cold liquor of our canuck neighbors tells me that somethingâs wrong here in this country.  The American political process itself isnât flawed, but I believe that the way in which it is being executed could stand for some reform.  Itâs akin to using a supersoaker to shoot people with sulfuric acid; the squirt gun isnât evil, itâs just the mind behind the trigger.  Tenscore and 14 years ago, give or take, our forefathers brought forth one hell of a constitution, which was rigid enough to uphold the law of the land, but flexible enough to be changed if need be.  And it was vague enough that people could dictate their own morality.  And Rights!  We get new rights all the time!  The right to vote, the right to drink, the right to turn on red, the right to writing articles like this oneâ¦ Fab-u-tab-ulous.    A flexible law system in which all people are entitled to life, liberty, property, etceteraâ¦  Sounds keen, huh?  But it doesnât seem to pan out.  Mumiaâs in jail next to Tommy Chong, and the thrice convicted rapist is released, only to stab, then rape another victim.  Right?  People convicted of sensational crimes get book deals, and Iâm stuck here writing a damned BLOG!  Instead of justice, it seems like everything has gone terribly awry.    Wanna know why?  Itâs easy.  Stupid people are to blame.  Now, that is a rather all-encompassing group, so Iâll narrow it down for some groups to talk about for the time being.    -Stupid people who run for office. Itâs a well known fact that the people who should be running our country are out actually getting things done, which is why the nation doesnât implode like an eldritch Las Vegas hotel.  So weâre left with a popularity contest amongst all those people who annoyed you in high schoolâ¦ the prom queens, hard drinking jocks, pretty boys, and the kid who thought he knew the answer so he raised his hand all the time, but it turned out he was wrong, so he probably just wanted to hear himself talkâ¦ I hate that kid.  Its nonsense smear campaigns featuring nonsense issues and nonsense platforms.  Whenever anyone vaguely interesting gets into the mix, heâs accused of stealing votes away from major party candidates and losing elections.  Fuck that shit!  Itâs time the two parties in this country get an overhaul or a squirt from the aforementioned sulfuric acid gun.  No one I know is completely Republican or completely Democrat, so why the hell are we letting them run the place? Representative democracy?   -Stupid people that run companies. Corporations are waiting outside congress to pour money upon the folks that weâ¦ I guess we voted for, and itâs this money that makes laws and actions happen.  So forget writing to your congressman about how much you hate a certain law. Hereâs what happensâ¦ imagine the folgers commercial gone horribly, horribly wrong.  *Shiny looking fellow in a suit â Good afternoon folks, Weâve replaced Senator Congressmanâs sense of social ethics and responsibility to his constituents with hundred dollar bills, extravagant vacations, and whoresâ¦ letâs see if he notices the difference!*    Heyâ¦ this sort of fantasy fulfillment took the social edge away from rapâ¦ and it seems like itâs done the same to the people who are leading us.  And unlike rappers, they donât DO anything else except make laws for and look out for us.  To recap: weâre being run by a bunch of overpowered Student Council members who in turn are being run by the people who are in business to sell us things.  Could any good come from this?  -Stupid people who canât think for themselves. Now, this covers just about everyone, myself included.  We canât blame the ones we elected completely, right?   I mean, we let them play house in Washington and Hartfordâ¦ and we see the things that are happening.  What do you do?  Play Xbox?  Change the channel when c-span is on, to block out the poison?  Daydream about exploiting the system?  Come on, I know weâve all dreamed about lucrative lawsuits that would leave us independently wealthy and reasonably famousâ¦ at the very least youâve bought a lottery ticket.  Come on, scratching at it with a fingernail or a quarter, waiting by the TV to see if your number has come up?  You donât have to lie, but remember, itâs your own conscience.  Weâve grown jaded and apathetic because we see the political system as a thing we canât changeâ¦ but if you remember a couple of fellows who founded the country and wrote up a magic piece of paper that keeps us from a descent into chaos and anarchyâ¦ changing is exactly what weâre supposed to do.   The American political system isnât flawedâ¦ we, as citizens, have forgotten our responsibility to keep the fellows in Washington honest. So you donât like what youâre seeing?  Vote for someone elseâ¦ convince others to do likewise.  *looks at drew*   Can I go back to sleep now?   --The Slater",male,24,Internet,Aries,0

We put him through hell and he came out smiling on the other sideâ¦ granted we had to carry the bastard to the other side but I think you get the picture. Youâdâve had to have been there to understand the extent of the magic that took place. However, I was a wise booze-hound and keep a diary on Kozakâs exploits. Granted, I was drinking at the timeâ¦ the entire day and well into the next, in fact, so I canât guarantee that this is 100% accurate. Look to Kozak and the other fellas for confirmation. Meanwhile, just take my word for it andâ¦ well follow the wobbling Kozak.   December 6, 2003    10:02 AM ... Jake wakes up   We throw open his door, jam a Santa hat down on his head, and hand him a beer. He doesnât ask any questions which is probably the wisest decision of the day. He drinks his beer. We smile. Itâs begun.    12:52 PM ... Jakes falls down   The cock-rocking duo Two Kings is in attendance and they perform âUntouchable Wang (the loneliest virgin)â. Kozak is tickled pink. Then the booze gets in him and things take a turn. Kozak, after [winning?/losing] a beer pong tournament and throwing back eleventy-million shots, falls on the couch banging the back of his head pretty hard against the edge of the counter. He goes fetal for about 2 min and then quickly gets back to drinking after heâs able to uncurl. I smile inside knowing whatâs to come. Kozak starts to show signs that heâs no longer good to drive.    1:00 PM ... Jake has become a raving lunatic   At this point, Jake has begun declaring a number of thingsâ¦ none of which make any sene whatsoever. We generally ignore him and keep drinking. Jake follows suit with the drinking but continues to rant. I think he humped my leg at some point around this hour but Iâm not exactly sure. Iâm doing my best not to shove shots and booze down Kozakâs throat. The kid is doing a fine job of that without any help from me.    1:05 PM ... Jake falls off of a stationary couch   Sweet Jesusâ¦ and itâs more like he falls into a pile on the side of the couch laughing drunkenly to himself. Iâve never seen Jake this wasted and itsâ¦ wellâ¦ goddamn awesome. Heâs smiling to himself on the floor, drool glistening at the corners of his mouth, eyes half closed, his body rocking gently with subtle drunken laughter. Iâm pretty sure that he has no idea where he is or who we are. I know that heâs on the floor because he truly cannot stand. Whatâs more, I know that as soon as he has the strength, heâll be upâ¦ and drinking. Iâm immediately jealous and double my drinking rate. Take THAT Kozak.    1:08 PM ... Jake declares that his own mom his ""Hot""...(what the fuck?)   This we really donât understand. To be honest, Jakeâs mom is attractive. But what the hell possessed the kid to come out with this madness? None of us know or care at that point. Itâs almost like a car accident. Kozak has become a booze monster and weâre feeding the demon soâs that we can all be safe. At this point Kozak has ceased to make sense 90% of the time. Those of us who know better are proud of him.    1:09 PM ... Apparently Jake is unable to lay on the couch without holding on...(wow)   This pretty much explains itself. Kozak has become a series of heaps appearing and disappearing all over the apartment. Weâre trying to think of a way to slow him down and weâre all drawing a blank. He begins pouring his own shots. We watch in semi-drunken horror and fascination. Kozak wields the vodka like some vile liquid sword. We give him plenty of space. Occasionally he talks but, at this point, itâs all garbled nonsense.    1:11 PM ... Kozak parents arrive with food unbeknownst to Kozak.... Jake shits his pants... then proceeds to hug everyone... over and over... and over... and over... ... and  over... (wow)   This was one of my favorite moments in the day. Earlier that week, we thought it would be awesome to have Jakeâs parents over to see there son all wrecked and such. I called over to his house and asked his mom if theyâd come over. She responded with an enthusiastic, âSure! What do you want us to bring?â. This day, they walk in to find Jake in pile form. Heâs managed to find a way to stay on the couch. I guess thatâs good. He hears his momâs voice and cringes/smiles. His parents come in to view the drunken wonder that is their son and the kid does not disappoint. He doesnât really speak a version  of English that most mortals understand at this point. Heâs been reduced to gesturing and hugging to show his affection and he does it with great fervor. The parents smile and sit back and watch. We bring them into the foreground by teaching them beer pong. Jake has disappeared.    1:54 PM ... Jake spews   Just as the Kozak parents were leaving, we find the kid. Heâs vomitingâ¦ hardcore. We all cringe a bit, knowing that this is probably the end of the party. We take turns going in to check on and comfort the kid. He seems to have and endless supply of spew. We pray for his salvation.    2:08 PM ... Jake is still puking   Jen R. goes in to take pictures and Jake says ""I can tell it's you by your laugh.... I hate you you stupid bitch!"" Jen proceeds to take the picture like a tropper. I laugh my goddamn cock off. After picking up my cock, I use this opportunity to catch up on some drinking. Kozak continues to spew. I smile proudly at our work.     2:14 PM  Dry Heaves...   OKâ¦ this isnât fun anymore. Granted, Iâm not the one puking so I have very little to say on the matter. We continue to drink and continue to help him. I just want him to feel better soâs we can get more booze in him. Ironic, I knowâ¦    2:58 PM  puking... then passing outâ¦ thank Jesus   Itâs all brown fun coming out of his mouth at this point. English is a second language. The kid isnât all smiles and, after he stops heaving and chucking, we carry him into his room and he wraps himself in blankets and curls up like an oversized baby Jesus. Honestly, I hope he wakes up soon so that he can keep drinking with us. Mostly I hope heâs okâ¦ Iâm not a total ass clownâ¦.    8:00 PM  STILL passed out   What the hell? Heâs still passed out and Iâm trashed by nowâ¦ feeling somewhat guilty that Iâm at his party drinking beer and such thatâs intended for him whilst heâs unconscious. Also feeling a bit cheated. I honestly didnât think the kid would have passed out by the time he did but, then again, I had no idea that he was capable of drinking so goddamn much.    8:31 PM  Kozak finally awakes proclaiming ""There are levels of survival which I am willing to accept!""   Rock duo  Two Kings  goes in to check on Kozak and he flips out proclaiming the above. Kozak gets out of bed and â¦wellâ¦ things take a turn. Kozak wakes up with a âfuck that shitâ attitude and starts drinking. A tear comes to my eye.     8:40 PM  Kozak continues drinking... He is then dubbed, the ""Booze Phoenix""   Shortly thereafter, Keystone is dubbed his official drink (by whom I do not know) and he is subsequently named âKeystone Phoenixâ. Kozak seems to care less about his title and more about his booze. He puts it away like a champ and we stay the hell out of his way.     9:18 PM  Kozak is doing shots... game on   Sweet Christ of lifeâ¦ what the hell is he doing? - Is that Jagermeister? 151?... Dobbs gets the idea to make Skittlebrau... My godâ¦ Kozak consumes. We pray.    10:10 PM  Power hour   Santenella has invited us all to a power hour. Kozak joins us. My chest swells with pride. We drink and drink. The power hour CD is, thankfully, all Christmas songs. The apartment has become a drunken chorus. Iâve rarely ever seen anything that happy. I look up and Kozak is goneâ¦  . I keep drinking and finish off the power hour.     ??? PM  ???    After drinking all day, Iâve lost track of damn near everyone. Passing out on the couch, Iâm hoping Kozak is ok. He was smiling last I saw so Iâm good. I hope he enjoyed his birthday. I pass out.       Soâ¦ hereâs a side of Kozak youâve likely never seen. I certainly havenât. This kid became an unstoppable train. Hellâ¦ we didnât go anywhere NEAR the strip club. Kozak, if youâre reading this, I love you, kid. To the rest of you kids, I hope this puts things into  perspective. Instant Message Kozak at Artic Cataclysm. Tell him things. Meanwhile, Iâm headed off. During the writing of this article, Iâve put away 6 beers. Figured it was appropriate to be drinking. Take care.   âAll Hail The Wangâ  -- Two Kings   Untouchable Wang   --Dexter Otis Green",male,24,Internet,Aries,0
378453,1510754,2004-07-01,"Hello, my name isâ¦DEVILâS ADVOCATE â 12/04/03   Thanksgiving in my mind was always the gateway to the wondrous holiday season, the time when the food was plentiful, the snow was bountiful and the school days were scarce. Sitting down at your plate of turkey, stuffing and potatoes meant that the blessed celebration had finally commenced; that it was now time to put thoughts of school, work or responsibility aside in favor of lavish meals, festive gatherings and an almost otherworldly level of procrastination, apathy and general relaxation. A 24-hour gorge-fest on turkey day, 48 hours of good old fashioned Christian gift-giving madness near Christmas, and then the grand finale, 36 hours of drunken Bacchanalia when the ball drops on Times Square. Sprinkle in a couple of weeks off of work, add in a few days spent doing nothing productive other than sledding and drinking hot chocolate, and you got yourself THE GREATEST TIME OF THE YEAR, buddy.    Nothing else comes close.   As important as Thanksgiving is to the overall enjoyment of the holiday season, I always treated it as the beginning, nothing more. Sure, I love turkey day as much as any other hard workinâ, Commie-hatinâ American, but it never felt to me like the BIG DAY during the winter months. It was a day to spend time with family â no matter what you actually thought about them the other 364 days of the year â and to pig out on some good home cooking. But other than that, it was nothing more than the first big holiday of the season. The same held for New Years; not that I donât love the madness of December 31, but it is the bookend on the holiday season, the last futile attempt to eat and drink and [insert favorite sin here] as much as possible before jobs/work/school came calling again.   The big holiday was the one in the middle, the one that required â no, DEMANDED â a week and a half of days off flanking it just out of respect. The one with all the songs, all the great TV specials, all the great decorations and desserts, and - oh yeah, thatâs right â the little matter of a tie in with ONE OF THE BIGGEST RELIGIONS IN THE INDUSTRIALIZED WORLD.   The big one was always Christmas.  I never really thought about the reasons behind this â Iâm not much of a Jesus Freak, so I canât say Christmas is important to me from the âorganized religionâ standpoint â until I read the recent article penned on Beer Nâ Porn by the esteemed Dexter Otis Green. Mr. Green wrote an excellent piece where he described why, in his opinion, Thanksgiving is the superior holiday, and why Christmasâs rampant consumerism makes the holiday not only subservient to turkey day in his mind, but dirty and flawed in its own right. A great point, certainly, but it bothered me; and now, a week and a few glasses of scotch later, Iâve come up with a response to the bah humbuggers of the world.  Christmas is not only the best holiday of the season, but in many ways it is the antithesis of Thanksgiving. Christmas, no matter what Target/Filenes/Best Buy et al. want you to think, is all about  giving , while Thanksgiving is all about having, consuming, and most importantly,  wasting .  Let me explain.  As much as the pious among us would wont to disagree, Christmas is no longer a religious holiday. Heck, it never really was one, anyway. Even the most devout Christians will tell you that the real important days for the clergy is the Easter season, which recounts the last days of Jesus Christ and the essential tenant of Christianity â that Jesus Christ died and was reborn again for the absolution of sins.  Christmas, on the other hand, is a minor religious holiday, and was conveniently aligned by the clergy to coincide with the more secular celebrations of the winter solstice, to make Christianity more accessible to the layman. When you take into consideration the cultural aspects of Christmas â Santa Claus, Christmas trees (which â surprise surprise! â are a Lutheran tradition), mistletoe and the like âyou see that what we as a community consider to be uniquely Christmas is quite far away from the advent roots of the holiday.  Just because the holiday has moved away from its religious roots doesnât mean itâs lost any deeper meaning, however. In actuality, itâs the accessibility of the holiday to individuals across religious and cultural lines that make it such an important worldwide celebration, not just in the United States. What has become the cornerstone of the celebration is the giving, of showing your love for your fellow man through gift-giving, good deeds and a little spare change in the Salvation Army can.  Of course, Target/Filenes/Best Buy MegaCorp loves the consumerist slant of the holiday season, which is why starting the Friday after turkey day we are inundated with advertisements telling us what, where, and how much to buy for our fellow man. Its enough to make even the most idealistic person slap their head in disgust and cry âSTOP! Iâve had enough of this petty, materialistic holiday!â I must admit, Iâve felt the same way plenty of times, especially during those years when your heartfelt gifts to your friends and family are returned in kind by a generic âHappy Holidays!â postcard.   Perception, however, is never reality. The Great Private Sector in the Sky can try as hard as they can to saturate our minds with greed and avarice, but theyâll never succeed in destroying the true meaning of Christmas â namely, the only time of the year when everyone, from saint to sinner, martyr to murderer, is expected to put all pretense aside and  just be nice to each other, God Damn it .   Granted, it still seems that this spirit of giving still requires some measure of material wealth â after all, the ending of âA Christmas Carolâ wouldnât be half as touching if Scrooge was broke as a joke and unable to buy his way out of years of treating his fellow man like shit. But the important concept is not how much you can give, itâs giving more than you can that defines the true spirit of the holidays. Think about Bob Cratchit saving his meager earnings from Scrooge and blowing it on gifts for his kids and family, even when he himself didnât have clothes that kept him warm during the year. More importantly, think about Scroogeâs nephew inviting him to Christmas dinner every year, even when Scrooge continues to ostracize him and his family. Every year itâs the same answer, yet every year he asks the same question. Why? Because Christmas is about forgiveness, and family, and being giving not only of your money, but of your heart as well.  Take time to think about the institution of Santa Claus, and youâll see that even the great red icon of selfishness himself is at heart about the giving spirit of Christmas. Adults create the idea of Santa for their children, so that they can have something to understand and grasp before they are old enough to understand the true meanings behind the holidays. Why would we as a society perpetuate such a fairy tale that forces us to spend great amounts of time, effort and money on our children? Because we care, and because we want them to have the same magical experience of a Christmas morning brought to you by Claus and co. as we did growing up. And so we sacrifice, and save our bonuses and our pocket money, and spent it all on one grandiose morning where our sons and daughters can beam wild-eyed at a tree covered in presents. And the greatest sacrifice of all? We sign each gift âSanta,â not âMom and Dad,â and for years the children play with toys they never suspect came from their loving parents.  That, my friend, is the spirit of Christmas.   Of course there will always be people who miss the point, who never grow up and who only care about the gifts that are theirs, but the spirit of Christmas lives on regardless, and thankfully, most of us still understand what makes this holiday so special.   Thanksgiving, on the other hand, is the most selfish and materialistic holiday I can think of.   Thanksgiving is the polar opposite of Christmas. Whereas Christmas is about caring for your fellow man, Thanksgiving is all about taking care of yourself. Whereas Christmas is about giving to those who are less fortunate, Thanksgiving is about celebrating what makes you fortunate over others. Whereas Christmas is about sacrifice, Thanksgiving is about gluttony and greed. Thanksgiving is the celebration of ourselves, our success and our possessions, and worst of all, itâs central function is to  waste .  Who can honestly say they make only enough food for Thanksgiving dinner to eat in one sitting? Hell no. Thanksgiving is all about cooking enough food to feed yourself ten times over. Itâs about cooking a Turkey the size of Mothra just because you can, because you can afford it, because your local store sells it, because your country knows how to genetically engineer them that size, forever and ever, Amen. Itâs about mountains of mashed potatoes, acres worth of corn, turnips and squash, and seas of gravy. Itâs about ten trays of cheese and crackers before you even sit down to dinner. Itâs about twelve different desserts with three types of coffee and four different types of milk with varying levels of fat because some people donât like following up 30,000 calories of dead poultry with whole milk. Itâs about consuming. And at the end of the day, when you find that you canât possibly fit all the leftovers in your fridge, itâs about waste. Itâs about throwing your Auntâs three-bean casserole into the disposal because you know no oneâs going to eat it.   How can this possibly represent a day of thanks?  Donât get me wrong â Thanksgiving is a grand holiday, and in the hands of those who care, it can be a wonderful day of reflection and emotional connection. Unfortunately, for most it just ends up being a 12-hour Turkey and football fest, and I just canât see how that is superior to the magic and joy of Christmas.  Some say Christmas wouldnât be anything without the presents. What would Thanksgiving be without the turkey? Or the food? What a presumptuous holiday, one that celebrates the affluence of our society without care for the millions around the world who starve.  Itâs not always easy to be thankful for what you donât have, but itâs always easy to sacrifice yourself for the betterment of others.   Merry Christmas.  -Mr. Carson",male,24,Internet,Aries,0
378454,1510754,2004-07-01,"Random Rants and Raves   (Preface:  Note that this isnât my normal me.  I just sat down and started typing.  This may not be really coherent or anything.  I was compelled to write so I wrote. Now I got homework to do and stuff like that, I hope I can finally fucking concentrate.) -- The Phoenix  I donât get myself sometimes.  I caught myself staring up at the sky for like 5 minutes at the apartment.  I donât know what I was looking for, nor if I was looking for anything.  School started this week, which is good.  One of my teachers didnât even show up for our first class, way to make a good impression on the class.  I have one final this semester, and thatâs it.  My boss is in my discussion group for an online class, should help to make that easier.  I get to be in a pool tournament in mid-April.  That fucking rocks.  I love pool, I got into it a little as a kid, and I guess that was one of my wishes for my 21st birthday: to find a new hobby.  Billiards turned into that, and itâs quickly becoming a passion for me. Like some people to guitar, or some people to professional football or baseball, my thing is pool.  Some people know Tom Brady, Derek Jeter, and Wayne Gretsky; I know Allison Fisher, Jeanette Lee, Mike Massey, and Andy Segal.  Better than video games right?  In case you havenât figured this out yet, this isnât going to be one of my normal posts, this is definitely more in line of stream of consciousness.  I got a lot on my mind, and I need a purge.  Iowa Caucuses ended with Kerry winning.  Yay, the Democrats are still fucked in November, although the Presidentâs State of the Union Speech did little to help his own case.  Iâd like to see it once where the President doesnât get invited to the House to deliver his speech, and make him do it in the Oval Office where there arenât 300 of his favorite cronies clapping every time he says something.  I pretty much think Bush alienated himself from most of the âalternative lifestyleâ community.  I quoted that because I donât think there is a normal lifestyle, because weâre all different, no matter what MTV, sitcoms, or Clothing stores like Abercrombie and Fitch tell us.  Now I am not going to keep pounding on the door that Mr. Carson has all but beat down and set on fire with his last post, because I think he basically gets to the root of it.   Just remember, next time you want to go live in Florida, think about how much half the nation hates you for fucking up the 2000 election, and the other half loves you for fucking up the election.  No hard feelings though. Thatâs the past.  Ok, Iâm done with politics for now.  I caught myself staring at the sky tonight.  Donât know why, clouds covered the sky, I couldnât see any stars.  Iâve begun thinking about this whole school thing again.  Usually I would be one of the first to say that unless you get lucky, you need to go to college and get a degree to find a slice of happiness for yourself.  But what is that anyway?  Why is happiness going to school, getting a degree, getting tied down in a job you will probably hate, marry a man or woman that you may or may not truly love, have kids that are going to reject you when they become teenagers, retire when youâre 65, and then die without making your mark on the world?  Why arenât there more mind blowing discoveries in life? Why are people complacent with just âdoing their timeâ on earth?  Donât they feel a need to do something great?  Who says that happiness is the size of my checkbook?  Why is it that friends I know who donât have jobs, or didnât go to college, or went to college and left are so much happier than I am?  I canât just be sitting on my ass waiting for happiness to come knocking on my door, can I?  Things that should be truly beautiful in this world are often swept aside in the face of the high speed world that has become our daily lives.  We are owned by what we âown.â  I canât go anywhere without knowing what time it is when 200 years ago the only time people knew were sunrise, sunset, and noon.  What the fuck is wrong with me?  Why does it matter that it is 10:24 PM on a Wednesday night when I typed this when a thousand miles away to the west itâs an hour behind?  Is time that important?  I read a book called âFlatlandâ three days ago.  Itâs by Edwin A. Abbott.  I recommend it.  I hope you wonât have what happened to me and dream of dancing polygons that could kill you in your sleep, causing you to wake up and not get a good nightâs rest before your first day of classes.  It puts things in perspective a little, that there is more than your petty existence and what you âknow.â  You know shit, you know nothing, and thatâs step one.  Hit rock bottom, why should we hold back our emotions at the time when we need them the most?  Are people with voices in their head the crazy ones, or are the people who hear nothing in their minds?  I think about that because my voices do.  It doesnât make me insane, although some people would say I just imagined friends or something like that.  Imaginary friends are the best ones, they are never going to hurt you, you can tell them anything, and they are going to react the way you want them.  Itâs easier than human friends.  Actually, friends of any sort: imagined, plant, rock, cat; they are much easier than human friends.  I said cats especially because I like cats, but you can substitute dog in there if you wish.  It makes no difference to me.  I like how no matter what, cats have very few facial expressions, and theyâre always there when I need one.  I caught myself staring at the sky tonight.  Donât have any clue why, I donât know what I was looking for.  Why is it that the things you think will make you happy seem years away when the real stuff that would make you happy is right in front of your face?  I had a 6 hour long discussion at a pool table with one of my best friends and I found out one thing: The choices we make in life do not change who we inherently are.  I am overcritical much of the time.  I have cut my ties to emotions so finely that I canât appreciate the finest works of art and beauty. Who says they are works of art anyway?  Some mythical muse saying from the heavens that this is art?  But I digress.  Emotion isnât dead to me, but it is distant.  Correction, the good emotions are distant.  Things like love, happiness, joy, confidence, pride are all but a distant memory to me.  I could create something that would revolutionize the world and feel next to nothing but that it was another thing to do.  The negative emotions like fear, hate, and anger are right on the surface, boiling under my skin.  I canât say whether or not the real me is the nice guy everyone says and truly believes I am, or some grotesque Mr. Hyde whoâs just waiting to release himself?  I hope that my friends are right and that itâs just hard to deal with me sometimes and that deep in my core I am the guy that people like and like to be with.  Otherwise Iâd have to be evil, and I donât think I could deal with that.  Trust is another one of those.  If you are one of the scant few people in this universe that I actually trust, good for you.  The others?  Itâs not that I donât trust you, but you havenât proven it yet. If youâre not sure, you probably are on the second, much longer list.  Be my friend for long enough and you see that I have my ups and downs.  And that I donât trust either.  Things are going exceptionally well for me right now.  Itâs eerie.  More and more often I dream reality into existence.  Iâve been hit with well over a dozen cases of dÃ©jÃ  vu in the past month, from my dreams.  I dream it, it happens.  I donât know how or why this happens, but to be honest itâs starting to scare me.  I donât need to dream of someone getting killed and then find out one of my best friends died somehow.  Iâd probably commit myself if that ever happened.  I think that if there is a Supreme Being, it has been trying to get in touch with me.  Every so often, when I get complacent, something happens in my life that is basically pointing the finger at me.  I thought I had everything I needed in life back in 2001, and that I am totally reliant on no one but myself.  Then I heard a sermon about how Self-Reliance is a dangerous crutch in Oakland, CA (I was there on a school trip.) It moved me so much that I broke down crying in the middle of the church, and I didnât even feel embarrassed about it.    It comes back to self belief/self-confidence.  I believe in balance of everything. For all my ups there are downs.  Iâm like Icarus, who is flying so high he forgets the Sun, only to have his wings melt and plunge to Earth and his inevitable demise.  Iâm scared of getting so good that Iâm going to get knocked down again, and this time Iâm not getting up.  Itâs like a 15 round Championship Bout with life, and every time that I get the upper hand, I get sucker punched and hit the canvas.  Iâve gotten up every time, but even the most stubborn of us have to give in sometime.  I hope that I can get out of the ring or KO life before it KOs me.   I caught myself staring at the sky tonight, there were no stars. It was rather bleak and dreary.  The stars remind me that as much crazy random thought causing my fingers to type this that it doesnât matter in the grand scheme of things. Weâre so concerned about our own lives that we donât think about the grand scheme of things.  We came from nothing, then from stars, been blessed with the gift of life, to return to the stars, then to nothing when itâs our time.  In the endâ¦  Weâre just Star stuff.  Iâm out.  -- The Phoenix",male,24,Internet,Aries,0
378455,1510754,2004-07-01,"On Same-Sex Marriage    âArticle 1 of the Declaration of Rights, as amended by art. 106 of the Amendments to the Massachusetts Constitution, provides:  âAll people are born free and equal and have certain natural, essential and unalienable rights; among which may be reckoned the right of enjoying and defending their lives and liberties; that of acquiring, possessing and protecting property; in fine, that of seeking and obtaining their safety and happiness. Equality under the law shall not be denied or abridged because of sex, race, color, creed or national origin.â  This provision, even prior to its amendment, guaranteed to all people in the Commonwealth--equallyâthe enjoyment of rights that are deemed important or fundamental.  The withholding of relief from the plaintiffs, who wish to marry, and are otherwise eligible to marry, on the ground that the couples are of the same gender, constitutes a categorical restriction of a fundamental right. The restriction creates a straightforward case of discrimination that disqualifies an entire group of our citizens and their families from participation in an institution of paramount legal and social importance. This is impermissible under art. 1 .â[ EMPHASIS ADDED]  - Justice John M. Greaney, Massachusetts Supreme Court Justice, concurring statement from  Hillary GOODRIDGE & others vs. DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH & another , November 18, 2003.   âActivist judgesâ¦have begun redefining marriage by court order, without regard for the will of the people and their elected representatives. On an issue of such great consequence, the people's voice must be heard. If judges insist on forcing their  arbitrary will  upon the people, the only alternative left to the people would be the constitutional process. Our nation must defend the sanctity of marriage.â  [EMPHASIS ADDED]   - President George W. Bush, State of The Union Address, January 21, 2004  ---  I am pissed.  Strike that.  Iâm  wicked pissed.   I am withholding my full-blown assault on the ridiculous buffoonery of the Bush administration for another time and another place. Instead, I am taking time out of my day here to unleash my righteous anger on the unquestionable idiocy of Bushâs hard-line stance against same-sex marriage, before that coke-snorting dumbass and his legion of religious right ditto-heads destroy this country that I care about so deeply.  Thatâs right, I said  destroy . If we allow Bush and his cronies to take this issue to a Constitutional amendment, we will have seriously weakened the strength of our Democracy, over perhaps the most insignificant social issue of the day.  Let me make this one point perfectly clear â  this has nothing at all to do with whether I or anyone else should believe same-sex marriage is morally agreeable . I personally believe two men have the same right to be married that two women, or a man and a woman do. Other people disagree. Thatâs their right. Beliefs, however, mean as much as a barrel full of donkey shit when it comes to the impartiality of the U.S. Constitution.  My father, a deeply religious man, believes you can boil down the Ten Commandments, the Beatitudes, and all the teachings of Jesus Christ into two basic rules â Love God, and Love your Neighbor. Everything else, he says, simply comes from those two basic rules. Get those right, and youâre doing alright in the eyes of the Almighty. I believe you can do the same with the U.S. Constitution and the Bill of Rights. All you need to know about American Democracy fits into one basic statement:  go ahead and do whatever you want as long as you donât bother anyone else.  Incredibly simple, incredibly powerful and undeniably brilliant. All of the laws of the country stem from this basic idea, and all of the great social upheavals of our history (the abolition of slavery, civil rights, womenâs rights, gay rights, etc) have been times where we, as a society, have matured and learned how to better apply that basic idea to our community. A majority of the modifications to the Constitution, including the Bill of Rights, have been made with this principle in mind, and have served to strengthen our society. Those that have been added under false pretenses, such as the prohibition of alcohol, were quickly removed when it was clear that they served no purpose as part of the Constitution.  When the Supreme Court of Massachusetts ruled in favor of same-sex marriage last November, they did so because of the rules laid out in the Massachusetts constitution. Marriage according to the State is nothing more than a legal agreement, and pursuant to that agreement a license must be issued by the State to formally recognize the validity of such an agreement in the eyes of the government. Therefore, issues of who is and who is not able to marry come down to an issue of licensing, and as the Court ruled, there are no specific reasons why two people of the same sex can be refused a license based on the current legislative rules regarding the issuing of marriage licenses. Therefore, the refusal to recognize same-sex marriage in a secular context becomes a clear-cut case of discrimination, making it illegal according to  constitutional principles  to disallow couples of the same sex to obtain marriage licenses.  Now, because Massachusetts marriages must be recognized by the other 49 states, this becomes a national issue. It is clear that the same basic principles will hold when this case is presented to the Federal Supreme Court, and this is why the God-fearing religious right is so adamant about making a Constitutional amendment. The only way to guarantee that two men or two women cannot marry is to spell it out in ink on the Constitution â making it set in stone that same-sex marriages are not allowed.   This is by far the most asinine idea ever concocted, and it must be stopped at all costs.  Obviously, religious marriages can make any restrictions they so choose, because religious beliefs are protected by the Bill of Rights. Marriage, however, is recognized by the government through numerous tangible fiscal benefits, such as tax breaks and insurance coverage. Therefore, there is a secular component to marriage that is recognized by the state, and because of a little thing called the sep aration of church and state , secular marriages in this country  cannot  be restricted by the boundaries of minority beliefs. By proxy, this means that sex discrimination in the case of marriage licensing is patently unconstitutional, and same-sex marriages should be allowed.  Period.  I have some sad news for the Defense of Marriage people out there. Living in a Democracy means that sometimes you have to put up with people who do not share your own beliefs. As long as their practices do not infringe upon your basic rights, they can do whatever they want, whenever they damn well please. And no amount of incessant posturing or empty-headed rhetoric will disguise the fact that your personal life is not affected in the slightest by the personal lives of others. Your heterosexual marriage is strong or weak regardless of the homosexual marriage next door. More importantly, the government or its policies can never control your religious beliefs about the sanctity of marriage. Therefore, you have no choice but to sit down, shut up, and accept the fact that civil marriages can and must take place between same-sex individuals.  To even suggest that a Constitutional amendment is necessary to remedy this non-situation is an affront to everything this great country stands for. To put an amendment in that essentially says âyou can do whatever you want as long as youâre not bothering anyone else, except for this one thing, which you can never do no matter what,â is not only indefensible, but dangerous to the stability of the Constitution.   I find it inconceivable that there are people in this country that are willing to fracture the pillars holding this great Democracy together just to tell two people who love each other they can never be joined in the eyes of society.  If you believe same-sex marriage is immoral, or a sin, thatâs your opinion. If you believe it should be illegal, then  you are wrong . Itâs that simple.  Never mind the benefits that would come from a society where same-sex marriages were legal, both for individuals and for society. Marriage allows people to consolidate their income, to receive beneficial tax breaks and insurance deals. This allows them to invest more money into purchases, into real estate and other venture capital pursuits, which improves the national economy. More importantly, same-sex marriages may serve as the perfect outlet for one of the greatest concerns in modern society. In 2001, over 290,000 children entered foster care. Thatâs over a quarter million American children without a stable family environement. Add in to this the number of children born into adoption each year, and thatâs a staggering 400,000-plus children each year in need of a loving family. Who could possibly help out in raising these kids, providing them with a healthy living environment and a nuturing social structure?  News flash â gay marriages donât often produce babies. Itâs a biology thing â ask your parents.  Gay marriages represent a segment of the population that are willing to take on these foster children and raise them in a family structure. They cannot afford to do so without the tax breaks offered by legalized marriages, which as we have stated before are Constitutionally permissible. There are no justifiable reasons why gay individuals should not be allowed to marry. Except of course that whole God thing. But if you read the Constitution, youâll realize that thereâs a little thing called the separation of church and state that has something to say about your religious beliefs and their bearing on public policy.  Plus, to those who say raising a child in a same-sex marriage is unhealthy, I ask this. Why is it any better for a child to be raised by abusive or negleting parents, just because they are heterosexual?   Bushâs statements in the State of the Union address should put fear in all Americans, right and left wing, religious or atheist. We are not talking about the morality of homosexuality, nor are we talking about the role of marriage in society. We are talking about the sanctity of the U.S. Constitution, the document that has seen us through 228 years of hardships, one civil war and countless social upheavals. We are talking about the one code of laws that manages to keep this dumbass country from legislating itself out of existence.  Please, please, pretty please with sugar on top â donât fuck with my Constitution.  --------  Oh yeah â donât vote for Bush, either.  -Mr. Carson",male,24,Internet,Aries,0

Consider this my first official post of the new year.  ...I knowâ¦ âbout damn time :)   The following is part one in a four part series that Iâm gonna try and bang out in a week. Iâm usually up well past a reasonable hour and oftentimes Iâm alone in front of a monitor or a television or a novel or some such thing. Invariably, my mind gets to wandering and I find myself lost. Most times the night ends with me shaking my head and going to bed. This time, however, Iâve decided to share a bit of that with you bastards. This first part is my take on love. Don't go expecting this to make sense... this is me strained through twilight and beer. This is [Dexter] after the witching hour... this is my unedited madness... Hold on to your gonadsâ¦    Part I - Love    On Love   I  if when you cook gulash(sp?)    and i, bleary-eyed, 		     stare and stare        at the soft          Camera dollies in slowly rIse of your neck siLhouetted by the stOVE lamp         cUt to medium shot and PLEASE take delight in    directing my own little pLAY     chuckling WITHal       Would you chastize ME?  II  In November freeze swarms of autumn leaves crack against the windshield in head-light drunk glory,  So contagious their abandon that cortex and testes  travel time to remember when  I took shape! between lines of antimony  and fell  A lash to the cold.  III   I saw your face  Etched in mist By the branches  Outside my window. An equation crawled  across my wall and divided into the null set.   --  Ram S.Iyer    I fall in love all the time. Hard. Thereâs really no rhyme or reason to it either (and I suspect that would make it easier to deal with). No certain look, no melodious voice, no athletic prowess or intellectual whatnots have been able to truly catch my eye in the beginning. Itâs always some oddball thing. They way they chew their food, the way they pronounce a certain word (cabbage â long story), hell even some annoying things have a way of capturing my heart wholly and without the slightest hint of reason.   That isnât to say that itâs love at first sight. In my opinion âlove at first sightâ is dramatic romantic bullshit that only happens in movies and cheap novels.   Nevertheless, however long it takes, Iâm eventually smitten without hope of recovery â or so it seems at the time. Having been captured I am, thus, their slave â unbeknownst to them, of course. I spend damn near every waking hour in a semi-conscious daze. I fret endlessly on how I would express this wonderful and altogether insane feeling. I write secret poems and love letters. I look for idiotic ways to signal them that Iâm interested. Hell, I even write dumb little love songs to go with my poetry. Itâs sad really.   Alright â maybe that last part was a bit dramaticâ but follow me.  I donât do well. I make a huge and wildly unpredictable ass of myself. I break easily. My confidence leaves me and every moment with that person (who before was simply another person) is bliss/agony. I frigginâ stutter if you can imagine that. Iâm barely myself. Itâs as if some great and terrible fire has been started and Iâm simultaneously warming myself by it and being consumed by it. And, whatâs more, if Iâm particularly unlucky, I am brought to the point where I reveal my affections.    (Shaking head) â Thatâs right â I tell them. Itâs horrible.  For all the confident assertions, manly showboating, and downright asshole-ery Iâm known for, at the end of the day, Iâm a softy. Love, quite literally, makes me sick.   Iâve spent the brunt of my years mulling over just what love is and how it works. My motive wasnât as noble or innocent as you might suppose. I did (and do) all this searching because I wanted a cure â badly. I want off of this damn love rollercoaster.  My questing has basically lead me to these two truths:  1)	Thereâs not a damn thing I can do about it â falling in love I mean 2)	Love was never intended to make any kind of sense and any search for such a thing is hopeless  I used to be afraid to label my feelings as â LOVE â â that frightening four-letter word. Iâd reason that I hadnât known the person long enough or that any number of other factors werenât âjust rightââ¦ that way it couldnât possibly be âloveââ¦ it was âlikeââ¦ or infatuation, or a crush, or whatever. Anything but love. Love takes years and years of cultivation. It doesnât just HAPPENâ¦ right?!   Boy was I ever wrong . (I hope you heard that, Don)   I came to find that my feelings were love. Infant stages, mind you, but love nonetheless. Similar to the way a baby is just as much a human being as an old man though they are wildly dissimilarâ¦  terrible analogy, I know but follow me. In much the same way, my feelings for these folk were born out of something. No spontaneous generation mumbo-jumbo hereâ¦ That love that I felt (and feel), like all love I suppose, was mothered by past experience and fathered by stimulation â what happened before meeting them combined with meeting them. That love is then nurtured by trust (motherâs milk), truth, compromise,. Etc. etcâ¦ you get me. Iâm not saying that every time I get a hardon, itâs time to go ring shopping. I AM saying that it was and is love and that itâs one hell of a mindfuck.  I still wonder why it happens like it does for me. Every time I go off spilling my guts and come back empty handed I say, âWhat the hell is my problem? I knew better from the start not to go off at the mouth about âloveâ unless I was sure that the feeling was mutual. What in the hell was I thinking?â. I know Iâm not alone on this one. Weâre encouraged to seek out love, to never give up until we have it, and (most importantly), to never let go. Weâre drawn this wonderful picture of what love is and we buy it and hang it on our wall and swoon. We curl close to our pillows and dream about it. I guess in someway every one of us is either waiting for it or trying to maintain it.   But why?   Why do we believe in this madness? And, whatâs more, when we discover the truthâ¦ when we find out that  love is the cure  and  the disease â¦ why do we continue? Is it really worth it?  Maybe so. Perhaps itâs the hope of love as the ultimate panacea that keeps us questing regardless of what we believe to be our chances of success. Itâs one thing to hope against nothing or to hope for the unlikely. Itâs an entirely different thing to hope and seek after something many of us would believe that weâll never haveâ¦ more so something that we believe that we arenât worthy of. THATâS the kicker. Love hurts, it is nearly impossible to obtain, and we are, by our own estimations, unworthyâ¦ yet we pursue it nonetheless. Because even though it may be hopeless and even though we may be unworthy and even though it may drive us insane when we find itâ¦ the good of it - the filling of the hole within us all so to speakâ¦ the death of loneliness - is far too compelling.  Or maybe thatâs bullshit. Maybe itâs way past my bedtime and Iâve had too much (or too little) to drink. Maybe love isnât any more important than football or bourbon.  Maybe.  I do believe, however, that love is something that starts from within. That love for another isnât pure if one doesnât love oneself. And I believe also that love is true in different ways for everyone.  So whatâs my truth? â love burns. As well it should! What good would love be if it was easily found? and when lost, if it could be recovered from in a night? Whereâs the value in that? What would be the point of a quest if you never left home, never left your comfort zone, never suffered, never fell flat on your face, or never lost faith? What good is it if there is no stuggle? No trial by fire? Iâll tell you. Zero good. No good at all. Because without the struggle, without the heartbreak and the hopelessness, there can be no appreciation. When you get burned, you bet your sweet as that youâll remember. And the bonus is that with all that burning comes purification. Hear me out.  Self love is something we donât spend time on. We arenât motivated by any tangible prize or even anything that we see to be worth it. We figure, most of us, that someone else will show us the way to love ourselves. And sometimes thatâs true. Sometimes someone else points us in the right directionsâ¦ reminds us that weâre worth a damn. True or not, however, truly loving ourselves makes us pure. Weâre less likely to do all the things that we do to impress othersâ¦ to keep up this image that weâve âperfectedâ. Thatâs where itâs at, man. Giving a shit about ourselves. Looking in the mirror and smiling back knowing all the merits and flaws of the person looking back at youâ¦ loving that person and living accordingly.   But we donât. Instead, most of us spend time enumerating and focusing on our weaknesses as if they somehow make us unworthy. We come to fear and hide our flaws from ourselves and others rather than embracing and dealing with them. Then we get all bitter and jaded and we lash out at the ones around us. Itâs pathetic really. I heard (or read) a while ago that goes something like this:   A grandson told of his anger at a schoolmate who had done him an injustice. Grandfather said: ""Let me tell you a story."" ""I, too, have felt a great hate for those that have taken so much, with no sorrow for what they do. But, hate wears you down and does not hurt your enemy. It is like taking poison and wishing your enemy would die. I have struggled with these feelings many times. It is as if there are two wolves inside me: one is good and does no harm. He lives in harmony with all around him and does not take offense when no offense was intended. He will only fight when it is right to do so, and in the right way. But the other wolf is full of anger. The littlest thing will set him into a fit of temper. He fights with everyone, all the time, for no reason. He cannot think because his anger and hate are so great. It is hard to live with these two wolves inside me, for both of then try to dominate my spirit."" The boy looked intently into his grandfather's eyes and asked, ""Which one wins, Grandfather?"" The grandfather solemnly replied, ""The one I feed.â   Iâm not one for quick-serve morality tales but this one stuck with me.  ""The one I feed.â  Damn. Speaks for itself.  Love is a hand job in the back of a Chevy. Love is a hard-on in the middle of gym class. Love is a cashier popping bubblegum behind the register in a pink halter top with shiny black fingernails and a stud in her tongue. Love is soul searching. Love is truth minus rationale and logic. Love is a beer glass thatâs never empty.  Somehow I feel like Iâve digressedâ¦ imagine thatâ¦.  Love :::grumble::: I wish there were an easier way about it all. Noâ¦ not even thatâ¦ I wish there were some sort of sense or order to it, you know? Something to be sure ofâ¦ something that could be counted on other than the fact that the only guarantee is that if you arenât careful, you will most certainly get burned.   Most of all, I realize that, with all my ranting, itâs what I want. And itâs what you bastards want too. :::shaking head::: itâs a vain wishâ¦ that I should be able to ignore itâ¦. it being love - my want for love, to be more specific.  Iâm tired of movies lying to meâ¦ telling me itâs easy if only I can be clever enough to plot my way into the heart of the one I loveâ¦ or stupid enough to fall ass-backwards into loveâ¦ or rich enough to buy themâ¦ or pathetic enough that they canât help giving in to my whining pussy tears.  Iâm tired of music telling me that love is the end all be allâ¦ thatâs itâs all weâll ever needâ¦ that love is so easy! All you have to do is :::insert dance craze::: ! Iâm tired of music making something that was meant to be an  internal  epic, an  external  epic.    Clue #1:  No matter what a song tells you, your lover will not die for youâ¦ or bring you the moon or any of that shitâ¦ ever.   Clue #2:  Love is NOT all you need   Clue #3:  Love is like taking a massive shitâ¦ sometimes you canât help it and sometimes you can and, though it can get tough and tricky at times, itâs worth it in the end.  Love is the end of fear.  Love is war is hell is on earth is beautiful.  Love is finally getting some sleep.  ...  --  Dexter Otis Green",male,24,Internet,Aries,0
378457,1510754,2004-07-01,"Many times I hear people talking about how they have a friend that looks just like Eddie Murphy or Bob Costas or Shelia E or some crap like that. When I finally meet these people, they look only vaguely similar to the person they're supposedly a dead ringer for... like they're a black guy or they're short or play the drums. What a crock.   This kid, however, has stood every test known to man. Believe me when I say that, in everyway imaginable, he IS the comic book guy from The Simpsons. I defy anyone to say otherwise. The resemblance is such that I would believe that the charater is based on him.   It's amazing.    Beside that,  Eric ""Dobber"" Dobbs  (or King Dobbs... which no one calls him... ever... except like if we've been paid... or have been drinking... or accidently wander into his bondage dungeon... again...  ) is a decent fella. $1,000 to the man (or ... ...woman.... ) who can best this man in a Geography Bee. And you're main-lining some serious fucking H if you think that you can match wits with this kid in Classic/80's trivia. The kid has blown loads that reach farther than your supposed knowledge.  Bitch.  Anyway... He sent me this piece about baseball's Roger Clemens and I figured I'd toss it up here. This should more than pay for the dead whores his ma found in his trunk (sorry buddy.... waste not want not).  Enjoy...   --D.O.G.     And the Rocket takes off... Roger Clemens declared in October 2003, after the World Series, that he would retire. His statements to that point were that he would be a Yankee forever, and that he'd retire with the team that finally brought him his first World Series ring after a brilliant 15-plus year career. Just this week he announced that he was ""un-retiring"" and had signed with the Houston Astros a one year contract.Way to send out a message, Roger. We may be saying ""Roger"", but we are not hearing you loud and clear.   Now, as a New York Yankees fan, I feel a twinge of betrayal. Here was a man who would do anything to get into the pinstripes, to be a part of the vaunted ""Yankee mystique"", and who wanted to be a Yankee forever. His words apparently meant nothing. Of course, the Boston fans are privately gloating at the fact that the man who betrayed them by first demanding out of Boston and then 2 years later signing with the hated Yankees. It may be schadenfreude born out of 85 years of disappointment and the recent races between the two hated rivals that feel akin to the Punic Wars, where neither side is happy with victory unless it comes with the ability to utterly humiliate the other. Boston is now getting it's chance to sow salt in the Yankees' fields. But Roger's decision speaks to more. If Yankee mystique means nothing to loyalty anymore, then loyalty in the sports world is truly dead.   Being a Yankee is not something you chose, it is something that chooses you. There's a reason the Yankees are able to attract many of the best foreign players to sign contracts with them: They want to be Yankees, not just to play for them. You would do well not to excite the karmic backlash of turning on it. Yet Roger views the Pinstripes as mere clothing, to be discarded at one's own whim. Now, I'm not ignorant of the fact that Roger burnt every bridge out of Boston and Toronto in his rush to leave the two cities; in fact, I half-expected his decision to be more worthless than World Series tickets printed by the Devil Rays in mid-April. It is denying that being a Yankee ever meant anything to him that hurts. And now his time as a Yankee is done... he only played for us. But he is no Yankee. And if the Yankee mystique meant enough for him to want to be a Yankee, but not enough to stay one, then good effin' riddance. At least this time he picked a city that he was not likely to get booed in 36 times a year.   Furthermore, does it even count as retirement if you don't miss one game? That's another thing that's bugging me about this. Roger Clemens retired at the end of the 2003 season. Retirement usually has a connotation about it: that you're done, you're removing yourself from the stress of your occupation to pursue other goals. But now he's coming back. Dominik Hasek, goalie for the Buffalo Sabres and Detroit Red Wings, announced his retirement several years ago. But now he's back for another run. Michael Jordan has retired and come back so many times that I'm sure we'd never trust an announcement that he was dead until we had a chance to personally examine the body for 3 days. I can trace the retirement phenomenon back further than Jordan; Magic Johnson did it before Jordan, but his was to prove a point. He retired based on his announcement that he was HIV positive, and that he shouldn't put himself or others at risk. But he came back, to prove to us all that he was strong and could keep playing if he wanted to, a story of heroism. Mario Lemieux also did this, but for the same reasons: he was sidelined by Hodgkin's disease, and made a full recovery; he came back to hockey because he loved the game and he wanted to end his career on his own terms, not because he was forced to. But retiring used to mean something: it was bowing out gracefully when it was clear your skills are never gonna be the same (Wayne Gretzky, Cam Neely, and others); it was going out on top (Michael Jordan's first retirement, Ray Bourque), or when you cannot possibly continue as you are, wracked by injuries (Steve Young, Lou Gehrig, Babe Ruth) and going out before you do severe permanent damage to your body. It was a moment of tremendous anguish if you were a team's superstar (Lou Gehrig's speech carries so much emotional punch even today), and a last moment of grace if you were merely good. Now, it barely means anything. It's almost become a bargaining chip (I'm convinced that Rocket's retirement in October was effectively a move to negotiate to the Astros, hoping to catch them in a point of desperation that they might lose the opportunity to gain possibly the best pitcher of the last 20 years).  Loyalty is dead. The meaning has been sucked out of retirement. What's next for sports fans? So proclaims the King, this the 23th day of January, the year 2004.   -- E.

My fellow conversant smirked and said âYeah, heâs an asshole,â as I discussed a recent episode. The conversation soon turned to different topics, but a thought that had sprung from his comment sat in my brain, and I thought about it later.

I am 25 years old, working full time, attempting to get back to school so that I can really start my career and my life.  Friends are beginning to get married and start families.  We are all getting older and dealing with what that means for us as a group and as individuals.    Living at Home is Fun   While I really shouldn't complain, I need to get out.  I am not restricted in anyway really.  And, I could move out.  I'm not the only one of my friends still mooching off my parents.  Many of them are to one extent or the other.  I don't feel, therefore, that I am falling behind.  Sometimes I just want to feel all grown up and on my own.    College Woes   I do not have a college degree.  I am about halfway there and am planning on beginning classes again in the fall.  My problem is that I haven't taken a class in almost six years.  To be honest, I'm scared.  Everyone tells me it's easier after you've taken time off.  You work harder.  You understand what's out there a little more, and often times that means you know just how necessary a degree can be to survive in the workforce.  There is no reason to believe that I won't do well.  I did fine before.  Nerves and paranoia rule my life.    The Job from Hell   I hate my job.  That is my biggest complaint.  I work in a job with no appreciation, no room for real advancement, and most importantly no fun.  It is no fun at all.  I know that I won't be there forever and that is very good.  I also know that I could get another job.  I won't get into why I stay here, but if all goes well I will be gone when I start school at the latest so that helps.      What Does it all Mean then?   What then was my purpose in writing this and presenting it all to you?  I don't really know.  I'm just venting.  Life has not gone completely as planned.  That's true for most of us though.

Man, I tried to get this printed a least 1,000 times and the Daily Campus (the University of Connecticut ""newspaper"") refused to print it due to their obvious lack of enlightenment and journallistic integrity.  bastards...  It occured to me today that this can finally be in print.

I pray that you are able to pass over the torture that is the U of C. If not then consider this fair warning. You're in a culinary paradise, my friends. UConn food is nothing but laxitive in 43 flavors.  Why am I posting this after all this time?  ...2 reasons  1) It's about damn time  2) Why the hell not? - I'm tired and George Killian told me to... so there...  This is a story told by me at 19... a year after discovering the horror that is  UConn Meat .   (P.S. Ladies, I'm 24 now and not afraid of jailbait... who wants a moustache ride!... ... by which I mean keep your creepy oh so fertile coochy-cooch to yourself... oh and women aren't people ::: ZING !:::)  Read on if you dare....      âUconn Meatâ vs. D.P. Dough â The battle rages on           (Beware the cows!)   ( Dexter @ 19 )  Once upon the time in the real world, I used to enjoy eating.  I loved foods like hotdogs, cookies, pasta and macaroni and cheese, bacon and eggs, steakâ¦  That did not last for very long.  My first semester here at Uconn after a couple of weeks of dining hall food, I thought to myself, âYa know, itâs really not that bad.  I could always go home every now and again and get a decent meal. By the time I really get sick of it, the year will be over and I can go home.â Soon that turned into, âMan whatâs that smell?â to âI think Iâm blindâ, and finally, âDear GODâ¦.  My bowels!! Theyâve come to life!! Can a real crop of fructose ever inhale choice iodine?  Perchance to steal a ligament of time?â  I have had some pretty nasty food in my short life.  Nothing compares, however, to the relentless ferocity of what I now call âUCONN meatâ; the stomach churning, face distorting, mind warping concoctions heated (if weâre lucky) and served to us all. Call me picky but all I want is something that tastes half-decent.  To be honest, Iâm only slightly concerned about how nutritious it is.  Day after day chunks of âbar-b-q thisâ and âteriyaki thatâ are shoved in students faces and the bad news is, itâs not getting any better.  Today itâs questionable macaroni and cheese; tomorrow itâll be hot nameless bar-b-q flavored grayish slop (only 2% rat excrement!).  What are we to do?  I suggest either getting to know your friendly grocer or numbing your lips and tongue with ambesol before every meal.   	The real question isâ¦ what are we eating!!  Seriously!  I doubt that anything that taste like reheated teriyaki/bar-b-q rice crispy mystery beast could be 100% natural.  Iâm betting 2% all natural at the most.  So, where does it come from?  Why is it here?  After much thinking and some help from an unexpected âvisionâ (note: donât drink the water from mirror lake.  If, by some chance you do, tell He Who Learns in Timple Shinders that I shall never returnâ¦NEVER!)  Iâve come up with a few theories.   A. 	UCONN has a deal with a covert radiation experiment facility in which mutated animals are exchanged for student financial aid records and tickets to menâs basketball games. Then, after being forced to endure hours of tortuous dancing for unnamed UCONN faculty, they are promptly forced through one of several doors for âreconditioning and processingâ; a secret process known only to very privileged staff of dining services.  The end result is served to us (give or take a vat of cheese, lard, and moose testicles) under the guise of one of three meats: chicken, pork, or âmystery beastâ.   B. 	Iâm almost positive it has something to do with an unseen Phyllis Dillar/Backstreet Boys connection.  Itâs clear that something is definitely not kosher in that area but Iâm not sure what it is exactly.   C. 	Itâs all about the mystery beast. Need I say more?  I didnât think so.   Ok, so the food sucks. âWe have no other convenient alternative!â you say? Nay, I say, and nay again!! My beer-guzzling chums, there is an answerâD.P. Dough!! God gift to UCONN! With millions (or about 40) different varieties of calzone, one could conceivably eat D.P. Dough everyday for lifeâ¦ or about a monthâ¦ which ever comes first. I personally stand by the Bar-b-q steak and cheese. The bar-b-q sauce in it is meant to trick my body into believing that UCONN meat is still present in my system. Otherwise, Iâd go into withdrawal and devour my own body up to the waist. Iâve seen it happen. Itâs not pretty.  Iâd like to take this time out to thank D.P. Dough for their miracle concoction. Without it, I would surely perishâ¦ or just be really sad.             A friend of mine once told me that everything we ever wanted to know, we could learn by simply âlooking to the cows.â  He was shortly thereafter committed to the Silicone Valley Mental Institution for organizing gerbils and Dan Quayle to create the perfect Andrew âDiceâ Clay/Martha Stewart hybrid in an attempt to overthrow the government with covert communist tactics.  I never spoke to him again.  However, he did have a point.  The cows are not always what they seem.    Good? Bad? I don't really care - it's finally posted and I can go on composing drivel.

378464,1510754,2004-07-01,"Confessions of an Unrepentant Alumnus, or How I Tried to Get My Degree Revoked Through Blogging    I just found my diploma while sifting through some random boxes of personal papers in my closet. Itâs framed in a Wal-Mart plastic frame, because I didnât really want to invest in the solid brass medallion and gold leaf trim and stupid amounts of money they ask for such things. Itâs sort of strange and terrible that they nickel and dime you on the way out of collegeâ¦ graduation gown this, yearbook that, âmemories that will last forever,â et cetera.   The truth is, I didnât even walk for graduation. My parents were disappointed what with my being the first member of my family to be granted a bachelorâs degree from an accredited institution, but hereâs how I tricked them; my sister (who is much better at school than I am) was accepting an award for academic superiority at Jorgensen auditorium, and there was a keynote speaker. And he droned on about how great sports were, and other school spirity things. I leaned over to my mom and dad, and whispered in a really loud whisper voice, âThis is what graduation is going to be like, only MORE boring.â And thus, I was able to watch cartoons in my underpants while my fellow students stood up in unison, and wore all black, tossing their mortarboards into the sky of an uncertain future.  Why didnât I walk? There are a lot of reasons, but I think the biggest one was I didnât really want to be a part of the pomp and circumstance capstoning a four year odyssey of terrible bullshit. This is not to say I learned nothing in college; I got a fairly good grip on delivery phone numbers, and I figured out how long it took to get to my classes from my dorm, so to optimize sleeping. I learned how to fake a mean F chord. And, you know, whateverâ¦ some good âdealing with peopleâ skills or something, although I think my summer job at a Scout camp really sharpened those and made me the witty bastard I am today.   Now, Iâm not one of the illiterati. I love learning. There were some times in college, while in the depths of some lengthy paper Iâd put off until about 12 hours before it was due, where I remembered exactly how much I loved learning. Itâs a shame it didnât happen more oftenâ¦ and this is part of the reason why I think higher education is so fucked up. How can an institute âdedicatedâ to the enlightenment and enrichment of young minds be such a hotbed of apathy and destructive behavior?  College is populated by a pretty substantial demographic of kids who donât really want to be there. Well, they DO want to be there, for the keggers and promiscuity. It tends to be worse at pricier, private colleges, where itâs a bunch of rich kids waving their gold plated dicks around. Iâve seen it. And itâs disgusting. Bunch of lazy, shiftless, empty people waiting to be kicked out for hitting the bong six too many times a day.  Not that good students are any better. Fuck those squares, says I! I would have studied harder if I wasnât afraid of becoming one of them. I mean, think about itâ¦ whatâs worse than lazy people in college? Study dorks! Locking themselves in their rooms, avoiding the light of day, looking down their noses at people sunning themselves in the quad and playing wiffle ball. I mean, at least the lazy folks try to make the best out of a bad thing. Study, study, study, get a diploma, get a good jobâ¦ do more work. These people are setting themselves up for juicy heart attacks.   The Studious make me even sadder for our future than the shiftless and unambitious. Hereâs whyâ¦ think about studying for a test. What do you do? Cram as much knowledge into your head as possible, and take the test, and do well on it. And you promptly forget everything you learn. I defy any college student to tell me what they learned about three semesters ago. This excludes fundamentals coursesâ¦ but even those are forgotten, especially the stuff you donât use in your advanced classes. And as for college graduates, everything fades once you embark into the dim, hazy world of corporate America. Even if you use your degree in your job, you still donât remember all those elective classes that were supposed to round you out as a person. Voyage of the beagle wha? History of South Africa who? Introduction to archaeology huh?    The sad truth is, colleges make it okay to practice academic bulimia, binging on sweet fatty knowledge and puking it up on a blue book or bubble sheet, only to make room for economics or art history. They encourage this mediocrity, stuffing syllabi so full of crap that no one could know the breadth of it without a frenzied bout of studying for weeks before midterms. But wait, letâs make all the tests occur within a week and a half of each other, to make people study even more frantically, and lose even more of it! Now, there is cursory analysis in some of the tests, but nothing really profound, and nothing original. Compare and contrast the work of Cicero and Virgil with special consideration for the concept of character assassination. And blah blah blah. These âanalyticalâ essays are basically arguments the professor made in class, so you are in fact just regurgitating more crap. Dance, student DANCE! Dance around like a little puppet and bend over like a bitch! If you canât binge orally, weâll have to administer your education anally.   And we PAY for this!  So this academic Ebola perpetuates itself, festering in the fabled âtest libraries of fraternitiesâ and 3x5s full of stat formulae. We lose the cards, we pass or fail tests, we go through the motions. And everyoneâs ok with it. As long as the letter you get at the end of a semester is nearer the beginning of the alphabet, game on! Itâs ALL about the bottom line. And for those of you studious folks who say âgo fuck yourself, Scott, I learn plenty and I love what Iâm learning and itâs not just about the gradeâ¦â well, I dare you to audit a semester worth of courses and receive no grade for them whatsoever. You wonât do it. Because the grade is too damn importantâ¦ grade point averages! Oh, no, I need a good GPA! If I donât Iâll become a homeless person!! People kill themselves just to get a high number on their transcripts. I remember another set of numbers that were terribly important to everyone a few years backâ¦ SAT scores. Havenât thought about THOSE in a while, have you? Itâs the same with these letters and numbers. Your percentile isnât worth a damn once youâre above and beyond this strange transitory period. After your first couple jobs, no one will even care. There will be new numbers to fret about. Now, children, repeat after meâ¦ Quotasâ¦ Quarterly Reviewsâ¦ four oh one Kays.  I remember my dad once said to me, âCollege proves to employers that youâre trainable.â And I said to myself, thatâs cool thenâ¦ this was when I was much younger. So I expected to learn how to learn, you know? But thatâs the opposite of what happens. What I learned was if you give the professor what he or she wants, you will pass the class. Itâs just a matter of figuring out what they want and giving it to them. So the content is not as important as the delivery of said content. So every semester, you had to start from scratch, unless you already had the prof, and then you just did well from the get go. Thatâs the secret to getting good gradesâ¦ you donât have to learn anything, you simply need to feign competence.   But why does this happen? Why would we pay so much money to these institutions, entrusting them with our education? Because the colleges feign competence as well. Job placement statistics, percentages of valedictorians attending classes, et cetera. They give us and our parents what we want to hear in our senior year of high school. âWe have a good program that will get you a good job.â And we believe them, and for the most part it works. People go on to lead productive lives and contribute positively to society, working just hard enough to get raises, marrying the college sweetheart, making 2.5 kiddies, which you will of course send to college. Itâs a perpetual motion machine that makes the world turn, fueled by emptiness and mediocrity.   Most of what I value as far as my education goes is what I taught myself, by reading books that were on no syllabus, save the one in my head. I read, I interpreted, I grew as a result. I never needed to prove this acquisition of knowledge to anyone but me. itâs a lifelong processâ¦ I continue to read things that change my mind, and I enjoy learning immensely, because the knowledge is acquired on my own terms. Iâve read many philosophy books, despite having escaped college without a single philosophy credit under my belt. I like to understand them without the bias of an âexpert,â who taints the material with his own agendas. Iâve read almost every holy book, and integrated teachings and morality from each into my own personal code of conduct. All this, having never benefited from a single theology course. These things, I think, are best leaned in the confines of oneâs own mind, sitting quietly with a cup of hot tea, without the stress of highlighting and writing in margins because of a âbig test.â I donât need tests to keep me honest about what I learn.  So after I looked at my bachelor of arts degree (lovingly laser printed and embossed with the seal of our great state), I put it back, shitty frame and all, into the box with the other things I donât need to validate my existence. I donât need a piece of paper to prove anything to anybody. The proof, as Temple grad Bill Cosby was rumored to have said, is in the pudding. So the next time you canât read a book because you are too busy with classes (I have heard this excuse, and I almost threw up with disgust), think about what youâre really being taught in the ivory tower, and why youâre eating the sweet lotuses that are making you content with forgetting things after youâve proven you know them. Youâre better off listening to meaningful songs and learning secret truths between the lines of wise dead folks and breakfast cereal jingles. When you are beholden to no one, there is no failureâ¦ only steps toward the truth.   Educate yourself; it is an infinitely more satisfying path.  -- The Slater",male,24,Internet,Aries,0
378465,1510754,2004-07-01,"Friends   What is a friend? 1.	A person whom one knows, likes, and trusts.  2.	A person whom one knows; an acquaintance.   There are of course different types of friends.  There are those who we know, like, and trust.  There are also those who we simply know.  In order to have a discussion on the merits of friendship, or the lack merits, we must differentiate between the two.  We cannot expect tremendous compassion, and support from all of our friends.  There are many people with very large amounts of acquaintances.  We cannot expect our more casual friends to bend over backwards for us.  While I think that we all know this and do not expect this much we must first be clear that most of our friends will never fill any supportive role.  We should however be able to expect compassion and support from a select few.  For many there is only one person that ever fills this role.  Our best friends should be people that we can count on.  We should be able to call them no matter what time.  Donât however expect that if you call someone at 5 am they will be bright-eyed and bushy-tailed.  Also, calling someone at a ridiculous time of the night/day should be reserved for emergencies only.     âAfter High School [my friends] pretty much vanishedâ   First of all let me say that this happened to me as well.  The people I was close with in High School I am not close with at all now.  I do have friends from high school, but the people I spend time with now I did not then.  Or at least not as much time.  My closest friendships are those that developed during my late teens and early twenties.  As people go off to school, work, military, or whatever connections are lost.  People drift apart and itâs not usually just one sideâs fault.   Should friends be anything more than people you enjoy spending time with?â   My answer is no.  You are very right Mr. Green.  But, I must say that there can be more to a friendship.  Donât expect your friends to make you into anything.  I agree with you on that.  There are people out there who can be trusted, and counted on.  Itâs a two way street though.  If a relationship isnât developed on both sides then no one is really to blame.  Let me use myself as an example.  Not that many people know me too well.  Not really at least.  I donât let people in.  Therefore, most of the friends I have are not that close.  Thatâs ok, and itâs my fault.  They are people I enjoy spending time with.  I have a few people that I can open up to and really talk to and be comfortable with.  People that I trust.  Including you Mr. Green.  Just remember that there is no magic safety net.  No, one is perfect.  That doesnât mean, though, that putting trust in anyone but yourself is bound to get you hurt.  There is risk involved in any relationship in which you open yourself emotionally.  There are no guarantees in life.  Being unwilling to trust people though is no way to live.  Your friends are not liarsâ¦  You can trust me on this one - Iâm one of your friends.  Jeffrey ""---"" Motola",male,24,Internet,Aries,0

Heh â I mean thereâs never really a right time for anything it seems butâ¦ well there are so many things I donât knowâ¦ a number of things I havenât gotten my hands on or been able to wrap my mind around.

Who am I kiddingâ¦  Regardless of the timing, Iâll get on with it. For now, this feels important. Not to mention the fact that ideas like this lend themselves to wordy essays and like responses.  (pauseâ¦ Continue)   Iâve never really had much trouble making friends. In elementary school, I was a bit of a weirdo being that I was one of 5.8 black kids in my school andâ¦ wellâ¦ I was an odd duck beside that. Kids gravitated towards me and I had friends no matter how strangely I behaved. By the time I was in high school, my friends spanned the forever-wide gap between lowly geek and mountain top jock. I fit everywhere. I was invited to parties because I could make people laugh. I could sit damn near anywhere in the lunch roomâ¦ even if I didnât know the people â hell in 5 min, I could make a friend out of almost anyone. I was almost always the first one to talk to the shy new kid. I was the guy that defended the nerds. I was the kid that stared down the meatheads and made them take back their band insults. I was the kid that showed that jocks have personality beyond their jersey numbers and school records.   Now I was by no means a hero or a perfect kid. In fact, I was a bit of an asshole. At the same time that Iâd stand up for anyone, lunch ladies included, Iâd just as easily tear them down. It really depended on my mood to be honest. There were only a few people (this included you, Josh) who meant much of anything to me in the long run. Iâm looking back now and realizing that most of my friends were social white noise. They helped me ignore how awkward and insecure I was. I didnât count on them for much of anything but to show up to school. And, like I said, there were a few who were worth a damn but, after high school, they pretty much vanished and I was left to start again from scratch.   In college, making friends was effortless and I wasted no time. I knew hundreds and hundreds of people after just a year there but, just as it was in high school, I didnât much feel that I could count on any of them for anything. But is that even important? By that I meanâ¦ should friends be anything more than people you enjoy spending time with?  Hoping on over to present day, I still have plenty of friends. And, let me be honest with you, theyâre some of the best friends a guy could ever hope for. And yet, somehow, Iâm still disappointed. I couldnât put my finger on it for a while and the past few months Iâve wrestled with it somewhat silently. I have all these friends and Iâm still lonely. Why? Then it hit me. Iâm expecting my friends to fill a space that they donât have toâ¦   Hear me outâ¦  I kept expecting some sort of magic safety netâ¦ if I ever fell, I was ok what with all the friends I have, right? Someone was bound to helpâ¦ or at least understand. But, though some tried to help, no one really understood. And Iâm terrible at explaining myselfâ¦ so I put a smile on and moved on when the shit hit the fan. And tactics like that are doomed to fall apart someday. My real problem, Iâm coming to realize, was that no one took much time to get to know me â and, for whatever reason, I sort of expected them to do so. Iâve always been a decent friend to people for the most part but rarely have I ever had a chance at the âclose friendâ role. So I foolishly go to these people expecting help or support or whatever it is Iâm looking for (most times I donât much know) and of course theyâre at a loss for what to say or do. Outside of the context of a party, hanging out, or the occasional late night conversation, there wasnât much. Now, thatâs not to say that there wasnât anythingâ¦ or even to say that there was only a little or that what was there was somehow insignificantâ¦  This is as good a time as any to get to the pointâ¦  What are friends for? All weâve heard via TV, radio, and such lead us to believe that friends are to be these wonderful pillars in our lives â âFriends give you wings to flyââ¦ and all that. But what if they arenât? What if friends are nothing more than people you enjoy spending time with? Now look, I understand that âfriendâ means different things to different people but I think itâs fair to say that weâve all looked to our friends for support at some point. My question is, what do you do when they wonât help?... or canât help? I mean you canât exactly get pissed at them. No one made any promises so none were broken. Whatâs more, the fact that, for whatever reason, theyâre unable to help you doesnât make them any less of a friend. Theyâre trying to get byâ¦ just like youâ¦ let go of your artificial expectations. As cold as that may sound, itâs true. Itâs a little ridiculous to be pissed or disappointed in someone who really hasnât made any type of commitment.  I know I knowâ¦ I have yet to answer my own questionâ¦ what are friends for? I donât much have anything in the way of a solid definition. I can say that friendship, as Iâve come to know it, means enjoying one anotherâs company for as long as it is mutually beneficial. Letâs be honestâ¦ thatâs all you can really hope for or count on. These dramatic definitions of friends saving lives and pulling one another out of the gutter are cheaper and more contrived than all the day time dramas combined. Weâve come to believe that our friends somehow owe us something because they associate with us. Whatâs more, we lie to one another as a means of indicating how important the other is with such clichÃ©s as âIf you ever need me, callâ¦ no matter what timeâ and âIâd do anything for youâ. Try calling on someone who has said this to you and see what kind of reception you get.   Obvious lies.  Why?  Real friends donât have to make promises or declarations. Such things are understood. Whatâs more, no real friend would expect another friend to take on the burden of their distresses. Thatâs just plain selfish. Your burdens are your own, chum. If you havenât learned that by now, you soon will. Those lofty pop-culture borne ideals of what a friend should be are flat out wrong. Friends are not our lifelines. Letâs be honest with one another here â we wouldnât trust the majority of our friends with our CDâsâ¦ to hell with our emotional wellbeing. Expect anything but good times and warm smiles and youâre in for some bitter disappointment.  I wasted a hell of a lot of time having high expectations of my âcloseâ friends. I made myself available to them at anytime â I mean I never said noâ¦ not because Iâm such a great guy but because it was the thing to do â itâs how I thought friendship worked. Likewise, I expected the same from them. When I did end up needing people, I looked around and saw that they kept on partying and working and living their lives while I sorted out my messes and confusions alone. I couldnât figure out how to say âHey! I need you!â and so I became even more depressed, confused and alone. No one really paid much attention and it bothered me a good deal until I finally said to myselfâ¦ why should they? Why should anyone help me with the messes Iâve gotten myself into? Hell, itâs  my  life, my problems, my responsibility. If friends decide to get involved, more power to them. If not, donât let yourself be catapulted into depression and confusion and whatnot. Get over it and deal with it yourself. Honestly.  Somehow weâve come to believe that we canât do it all on our own â that we need friends and loved ones to âcarry us throughââ¦ carry us through what? Are you serious? I guarantee this:  Putting trust in anyone but yourself is bound to get you hurt  and, if youâre particularly unlucky, itâll lose you some quality friends. Look, Iâm not saying I donât trust anyone â I certainly trust my mother and a good number of other people. I am saying that believing that you can truly count on anyone but yourself to help you out of hard times or into good ones is just plain foolish. People let you downâ¦ thatâs what they do. Iâll tell you right now, itâll be a long time before I trust anyone with more than a joke and a beer.   Dexter you old fart! This is bullshit! I completely trust my close friends with my life and Iâm sure they trust me with theirs. Theyâve helped me out of countless rough spots and I know that I can count on them whenever I need them.   How nice for you. Listenâ¦ all itâs gonna take is one timeâ¦ youâre in dire need and you look around and no one is their but you and your problems. What are you gonna do when there are no phone calls to make or IMâs to send thatâll solve everything? Short-armed bastards like you will end up a pile of snot and worry. Youâll choke down a few of mommyâs magic pills to help you sleep a good long forever sleepytime nap and your friends will forget about you before the earth above your head is firm. What makes me so sure?  Your friends are liarsâ¦ all of them  You can trust me on this one â Iâm not one of your friends.  They tell you what they think you want to hear. They tell you what they think will get you out of the funk youâre in. They really donât give much of a shit about anything but how you behave. As far as your actual well-being is concerned, they could care less. Why? Wellâ¦ thereâs really nothing than can do or even want to do about itâ¦ furthermore, they donât want to hear about problems that they canât immediately solve or give you a quick answer to â as long as youâre quiet about it, they wonât mention it either. And so long as they can get a good time out of you, theyâll take that as a sign that everything is ok and move right along.   Wake up â itâs true. And you thought you had âtrue friendsâ? â glad I had the privilege of disappointing you.   And, again, why should it be any different? Why should are friends be anything more than people who enjoy our company?     Youâll waste half of your life looking for friends âjust like on TV and in the movies!â only to find that such people do not exist. Weâre not alone in life, that much is true, but all the work is on our shoulders. The most you can hope for is a few lookers on.   What are friends for?  Hell, with all this babbling, I donât think Iâve answered that question exactly. And, to be honest, I donât yet claim to know what friends are forâ¦ or if there is actually an answer to that question. I do know what they are  not  for. (see above)  Donât expect your friends to make you into anything â a happier,  saner, more mature, fulfilled personâ¦. Any of that bullshit â thatâs all up to you entirely.   Itâs your life and you are on your own. Friends are better than video games...  Get your fucking weight up, chump.   ---  Dexter Otis Green",male,24,Internet,Aries,0
378467,1510754,2004-07-01,"A Fireside Chat with Uncle Vicodin    Tripped and fell this afternoonâ¦ leg hurts like a bitch.  Iâve been fighting it for most of the day, and Iâve finally given in and popped a vicodin.  So letâs see how my writing degenerates as I slip into madness, eh?  So Iâm just going to be keeping a running tab of whatâs going on around me, self editing as little as possible, though I will admit to doing some just now.  I will also admit to listening to rentâ¦ 525600 minutesâ¦ dunno why itâs on my computer.  GOnna change it. Switching over to jesus Christ superstar.  Big fan.  I love how judas and Christ are portrayedâ¦ so deliciously blasphemous, or so the religious right would have you believe.  Kinda gives them both a human edgeâ¦ which makes sense.  Even the greatest heroes and storymakers among us are, at their cores, just people.  Talented, maybe.  But by and large, theyâre just like you and me, if we were put into an extraordinary situation.  I mean, howâd you react to being told youâre godâs son, sent to save the world by dying for it?  Okâ¦ I think Iâm gonna switch off of JCSS, cause itâs a little too religiousâ¦ just gonna listen to heaven on their minds and rock it back on the back burnere until such time as Iâm not about to lose motor skills and basic judgement. Badass guitar riffâ¦ ROCK! Powerful voice, crazy bidnessâ¦ I think Iâm gonna have a cigarette.  I like cigarettes. Judas is badass.  In the musical.  And the bible, I guessâ¦ I mean, if it werenât for judas growing some balls and selling jesus out, he wouldnât have been able to die on the cross, right?  So in a sense, judas had to do what he did.  Should he be punished for this?  Or if you take the âjudas possessed by satanâ stance, should satan be punished for indirectly enabling salvation?  Doesnât make a lot of sense.  	Ok, new section, to be started as JCSS is eliminatedâ¦ voted off the aural island, so to speak. For continuityâs sake, it should be stated that this was written before the heaven on their minds commentary.  Andâ¦. Action.  Kid A is playing nowâ¦ much better atmospheric music.  Everything in its right placeâ¦ I like it.  Am I starting to fragment yet?  I hope notâ¦ thereâs no discernable pain reliefâ¦ I burned my finger on a hot skillet the other  dayâ¦ wonder if thatâll stop hurting tooâ¦ I suppose it will.  Now, for no particular reason, Iâm staring at an executioner miniature given to me by my roommate.  Itâs from his trip to London.  He looks vaguely sinister, standing over miniature Frodo, sitting in my desk lamp/ organizer. I have a set of RPG dice and casino dice there too.  I have a weakness for purchasing dice.  Itâs not like Iâm a statistician, or anything.  Nor do I think all things are left to chance, or luck.  Nor do I believe that itâs destiny, either.  It seems like everything justâ¦ is.  In its right place, I suppose.  My damned speakers are buzzing because of the sick amount of bass being thrown off by Thom yorke and his cronies.  I have to turn down the volume.  Kind of makes everything quiet, and distant.  The Vicodin will likely intensify this feeling.  The tactile reality of the keys beneath my fingers is creating a not entirely unpleasant sensation.  Ah, delicious double negatives.  Theyâre fun, letting you be dramatic in speech and prose.  Even though theyâre redundant.  But writing is being redundant.  So why are they so often avoided in grade school comp classes?  If I were to write as succinctly as possible, it wouldnât be very interesting.  Of course, this article might not be very interesting either.  Fuck it.  Iâm plodding along.  Hit track three already.  I used to fall asleep to Kid A, but now I prefer this odd little mp3 track I picked up somewhere or another.  Itâs kind of droning background music, with whacky little pulses, supposedly stimulating REM sleep.  It does, for all I know.  I rarely remember my dreamsâ¦ theyâre gone as my eyes open.  Sometimes I mentally grasp at the grains of sand which are my dreams as they slip through my fingers, descending into the vast oblivion that lies directly beneath our waking lives.  Itâs a fine line, you know.  Between reality and oblivion.  Water is good.  Nice and coldâ¦ I enjoy the feeling of drinking an ice cold glass of water when youâre really thirsty and havenât had anything in your system for a whileâ¦ you feel the chill go down through your upper body.  A similar sensation is achieved when you drink a hot beverage on a cold day.  But you know that already donât you?  I donât know why Iâm chronicling itâ¦ it just seems like the thing to do.  This is as close to stream of consciousness as I get.  There are many more things slipping around in my head, but I canât type fast enough to get them all down.  I can barely keep up with what Iâm trying to focus on.  Iâm making it a little bit of a race, trying to write it down so quickly that I can catch up, but I donât think Iâll be able to. Ehâ¦ fuck it.  I guess Iâm writing crazy talk because everyone else seems to be.  You wonât know it while reading this, but there was a considerable dramatic pause right there.  It would be interesting to develop a way to â¦ looking for the word.  Just a momentâ¦ read in real time, at the same speed the author wrote it downâ¦ kind of like spoken word, but with writing.  In retrospect, this is a strange and terrible idea which sucks.  Scratch it.  I was briefly considering going back through what Iâve written down so far, but I decided against it, since it would bias the rest of the piece.  It now occurs to me that biasing the piece doesnât really matterâ¦ hypotheticals are bullshit.  But still, Iâm not going back, even though I could and it would be alright.  Maybe later on I will.  It might be entertaining.  I have a fantastic set of tapes which feature E.E. Cummings reading many of his poemsâ¦ itâs on four cassettes, and he goes through all of his really well known ones, as well as his more obscure onesâ¦ including ones Iâve never read.  It is a really fantastic collection because going back and reading the poems afterwards, you can see the flow the man had, even though his text is formatted like a crazy person using magnetic poetry.  It makes me look at his work in a completely different way.  Poems are good because reading them and hearing them offer two vastly different experiences.  Donât remember when I took the pill, but it should be a half hour after that point where my crazy will truly begin to set inâ¦ felt a chill across my brain, which might mean that itâs coming along.  So bear with me.  Just did a word countâ¦ upwards of 1200 words.  Definitely feeling changes.  Getting a little lightheaded.  Wish I had a laptop so I could sit in bed and type that way.  But alas, I must suffer.  Oh wellâ¦ my hands have developed many more scars over the past year or so than Iâd ever had on them before.  The burn from the skillet, which I talked about beforeâ¦ plus a couple where I whanged my hand pretty hard, and started to bleedâ¦ theyâre still discolored, even though I got them a while ago.  Wonder if theyâll ever fade into that sickly white associated with so many other scars.  I also have pit in my lip where a mother of a cold sore lived.  You love to hear about that, donât you?  Herpes herpes bo berpesâ¦ heh heh.  But that onesâ not going away.  I wonder what it would be like to have small poxâ¦. Just nasty scars all about your face.  I wonder how people dealt with thatâ¦ I mean, theyâre shit loads worse than acne scars.  And acne scars are pretty bad. Wiped a little sweat off of my browâ¦ cool to the touch.  Donât know how long Iâm going to be able to hold up with thisâ¦ urge to sleep risingâ¦ although the headache is going away.  Glad I donât have any alcohol in meâ¦ or Iâd be really whackeâ¦ oh, waitâ¦ I had a hot chocolate with peppermint schnapps in it.  Hrmâ¦ this might complicate matters.  Oh well. Gonna take a short break.  	Ok, back.  I wrote that before the break.  For continuityâs sake.  ï  wowâ¦ I just smileyedâ¦. Weird.  Emoticons and net lingo have really pervaded our vernacular, havenât they?  Ok â¦ water break. Ok, back. All this talk about emoticons made me check my buddy list to see whoâs about.  I compulsively check away messagesâ¦ just scroll down the whole list.   Do any of you remember when they used to add checking profiles to your typing block limit?  The little bar under send.  I hated that.  Sometimes I would get locked out of being able to type.  Itâs disturbing to be disallowed expression.  It seems very symbolic, but that might be the drugs talking.  And ladies and gentlemen, let me assure you, they are talking.  gonna lay down for a little bit.  Be right back.  Drew just woke me up with a phone callâ¦ I only picked out like an eighth of the words he was sayingâ¦. Confusing and unsettling.  Dunno. Radiohead has resetâ¦ For some reason, Iâm now remembering burning this to cd and giving it to my ex girlfriend.  I remember drawing a crude facsimile of the bear with the teeth.  Which is My buddy Icon, Iâm pretty sureâ¦ checkingâ¦ just a moment. Yup, it is.  My arm is numb.  Makes typing an interesting prospect.  Iâm typing much more slowly now, I might have just embarrassed myself thru IMâ¦ I guess I didnât.  Talking to heatherâ¦ one of my very good friends.  False alarm, I have officially embarrassed myselfâ¦ letting slip my nefarious plans to seduce her with booze.  Hopefully it will slide under the radar.  Iâve added a wink smiley to make it more innocent, although trying to spin a plan for seduction into innocent banter is a difficult proposition.  Sheâs not answeringâ¦ this could be a bad sign.  Ehâ¦ these things happen.  Iâm eyeing my cigarettes.  Also a bad sign, since I know I just had one.    Words start to look funny when you single them out and disassociate their meaning form their makeup.  If you repeat them in your head over and overâ¦ they also start to sound funny.  Like youâre talking crazy gibberish talk.  Which also might be true regardless. Third time around for radiohead.    Iâm hitting the return button more often nowâ¦ the worst of the dizziness is gone, and everything is kind of separating, like Iâm lifting offâ¦ and sort of floating above myself.  Itâs kind of a dangerous place to be, because I am not particularly self conscious at this point, and donât care for/ recognize consequences.  I like the way the shadows play ac5ross my bedspreadâ¦ very abstract and whacky.. I think Iâm going to lay down now.   --  Scott ""The Slater"" Slater",male,24,Internet,Aries,0

Guinness AML:   yes  Guinness AML:   because the word has come to be assigned to blacks  wongdongy:  so it means specifically black people   Guinness AML:   it sure does   â¦   	Itâs been over 15 years but I can still remember my first day of 3rd grade. I went to predominantly white schools from 3rd grade on up. Before then, growing up in Hartford, CTâs North End, I rarely ever saw white people other than teachers and a few folk when I went downtown with my mother. It goes without saying, then, that I had no white friends. In fact, I hated white people.   	 Hated.    	Then, one evening, my mom came over to me and my younger brother and told us that we were going to a new school. Just like that, a new school. I didnât have many friends in school, anyway, so leaving them wasnât all that big a deal. My short lived (and utterly useless) protests came from the fact that it was a WHITE school. White people, white teachers, white nurses, white music, white everythingâ¦ it honestly terrified me.  Let me explain.  I believed the following to be true about white people:  -- White people are richâ¦  all of them  -- White people are snotty and talk funny. -- White people eat weird food - white people food. (Swear to god) -- White people are smart â black people have to work twice as hard as white people. -- White people listen to disturbing music. Because of it, some white people worship the devil. -- White people canât dance, sing, or play sports as well as black people.  and most importantlyâ¦  -- White people HATE black people. Period. Even if they claim to be your friend, theyâre lying. They want something from you. Black friends are valuable â theyâre evidence against racism â âI canât be racist â look at my black (nigger) friend! See?!â   	Itâs also important to note that these things that I believed to be true about white people I never ever believed could be true about black people.   	White people were pretty much evil and white people were certainly the enemy.    	So, with all these prejudices, I went to my first day of 3rd grade shaking like a leaf. I thought that Iâd come back acting like a white kid after a few days of school. I thought theyâd try to jump me. I had to defend myself. I had to stay black at all costs. Walking down the hall to my classroom, I felt white eyes on me constantly and was very uncomfortable. Every pair of eyes said âWho is  that  (NIGGER!) kid? Why is he in my school? He doesnât belong hereâ. I got to my first class and sat alone preparing for the inevitable introduction. Sure enough, I was brought to the front of the class and with my eyes on my cheap sneakers, I gave my name. Eyebrows curled and there were a few laughs because of my accent. I blushed hard and made note of their laughter â evidence. Then, it happened. âHeâs from HARTFORD and heâll be joining our class by way of Project Concern*â, my teacher chimed with a toothy white grin.   â¦   	As far as I was concerned, she may as well have said, âBe careful â this one is a dangerous nigger â HE doesnât belong hereâ I sat down feeling even more alienated than ever.   	School was easy for the first half of the day. I was in class with no more than 5 kids at a time most of the time so that worked out fine. But I was still very uncomfortable being around all those white people. Then lunch came and I freaked. I had made zero friends that day which meant I either had to sit alone or sit with white people and try to make friends.    	I sat alone.    	I remember sitting with my left arm around my tray, eyeballing the cafeteria DARING anyone to sit near me. I was so lonely and, part of me really wanted someone to come over. But I wasnât going to let them make me white. So I did the easiest thing a black kid could do in that school. I looked intimidating.   	Months passed, seasons changed and I had made friends with the kids on my bus (also from Hartford) and a few kids in school. They treated me like a visitor but it was ok. I had a few friends and that was better than eating alone. I had a small group of friend to go on the swings with at recess. Life wasnât all that bad.   	âNigger!â   	what?...    	I looked up from a game of Speedball and my new friendâ¦ weâll call him Dick Spiffy - was pointing at me.   	He was pointing at  me ? Was I a nigger?   	    	I knew I was black and that black people were sometimes called niggers by white people. But it was an entirely different thing to actually be called âNiggerâ outright. I was, to say the least, a little confused. Then, it hit me. It hit me light a lightning bolt and I took off after him.   	I beat the crap out of him.   	In the principalâs office, I got nothing but sympathy. It didnât go on my file or anything like that. It was dropped and I went back to class. But something had changed in me that took years to fix.   	The question lingered. Nigger? ME!?! Am I a nigger? I didnât know if it was true. Until then, I never had to ask myself if it was  true â¦ and, if it was trueâ¦ if I was a niggerâ¦ what did that mean?   	Nigger was something they called slaves. It was worse than a bad wordâ¦ it was a curse. When Dick resurrected that word, it felt worse than anything I had ever felt. I couldnât say why then but I think I knew. Nigger meant âYou are nothing â you are not one of us â You will never be one of us â You are lessâ¦ lowâ¦ and worthy of contemptâ. It was the embodiment of the evils of slavery. In North America, from the 1500s to 1865, âNiggerâ connoted âblack slaveâ but also âMaroon (A fugitive Black slave in the West Indies in the 17th and 18th centuries).â From then on, âNiggerâ connoted âsecond-class citizenâ as well as âMaroonââ¦ visitorâ¦ outcast. 23 years later it meant the very same thing when Dick used it on meâ¦ âOutcast! â Unclean!â   	Not one of you reading this needs the history of the word to know what it means.   	We all know what it means. Thereâs a definition beyond my words that weâre all familiar with. Nigger = hate. Itâs all but impossible to know how fucked up of a word it is until that hate is directed at you.    	Then there came Wigger.   	Wowâ¦ Wigger? Are you fucking kidding me?  WIGGER?!    	For the slow ones, âWiggerâ is a clever combination of words â âWhiteâ and âNiggerâ.  Astonishing.  	Let me get this straightâ¦ a wigger is a âWhite Niggerâ? What does that mean, exactly? Some kid wears Fubu and listens to 50-cent and Biggie andâ¦ well now heâs a Niggerâ¦ but he canât be a  nigger  nigger because heâs whiteâ¦ so heâs a  white  niggerâ¦ a wiggerâ¦ hahahaha! _ thatâs cleverâ¦ thatâs funny!      Guinness AML:  You know why I hate wigger more than nigger?  Guinness AML:  Amercian blacks were given the word nigger and told ""This means you're nothing""  Guinness AML:  they took it and, over time, changed it to mean ""This means we're family"" - it's an identifier... a sacred word  Guinness AML:  which is why I can call a black person a nigger and you can't  wongdongy:  wow  Guinness AML:  Wigger is thievery  wongdongy:  haha  Guinness AML:  we were given shit and made it an heirloom  Guinness AML:  and now it's being taken back?!  Guinness AML:  FUCK that   	Yes â it is  our  word. Your grandfathers gave it to us, remember? They made sure we knew that it belonged to us and only us.   	And it does.   	Wigger isnât an outright attempt at reclaiming the word butâ¦ well once black folk made nigger cool, wigger pops upâ¦.this fucking generic bullshit word that manages to be more insulting than the first. How? By downplaying the significance of the word âniggerââ¦ Chinese dude âactinâ blackâ yo? Heâs a chigga, B.   	Nigger doesnât mean black. Nigger IS black. Itâs a black word. Itâs a family curse that was converted to a blessing. A password. A conduit through which we can acknowledge the one thing that we all share â our victory over attempted dehumanization. We were once believed to be a dead people â less than animals. And, in many ways, we still live with the effects of the people who named us âniggerâ. Thatâs why itâs our wordâ¦ because it was given to us.  	There a number of things I want to say on this subject but Iâm gonna cut myself short this timeâ¦ no wrap up, no summaryâ¦ none of that.

378469,1510754,2004-07-01,"Humanity: the Toolmakers, or just Tools? (or: on being 24 and some monthsâ¦)    Iâm 24 and loving it.  I get to sleep late, be bothered by friends and family that I donât have a job (Iâm looking, kidsâ¦ trust me, Iâm looking.), watch cartoons in my underpants, and write my thoughts for the whole web to see.  Iâm trying my best not to be depressed about getting older, because Iâm really not that old.  Although, for all our crazy amounts of advancement, it seems that our developmental stage is increasing a great deal.  When my parents were my age, theyâd been married for three years.  And when their parents were my age, THEYâD been married for more like five or six.    This is not to say that Marriage is the âgateway to adulthood,â but itâs a serviceable litmus for judging how responsible and in the real world a person is.  In the age of my grandparents, a high school education could feed a family.  For my parents, a bachelorâs degree most certainly sufficed.  Now, all my friends are taking Grad school courses, getting more and more advanced degrees, and hiding in the ivory tower well into their middle 20s.  Pretty soon Doctorates will be run of the mill, and people wonât be beginning their intended careers until theyâre into their 30s.    	Is this a result of a longer life expectancy?  People are alive and kicking and active well into their 80s nowadays.  My Grandmother is full of pizzazz, and even remarrying (and donât think for a minute Iâm not a bit disturbed that sweet little gramma is getting more action than me nowadays).  Because life is longer, childhood follows suit.  Bunches of my friends still live with mom and dad (not that thereâs anything wrong with that, wink wink).  It seems acceptable to return to the nest to save up some cash and plan the next step.  Maybe this âgoing homeâ tendency is the reason for the prolonging of childhood.  And parents are of course not averse to this, because theyâre watching their kids grow up faster than an eldritch DJ spins up âCatâs in the Cradleâ at the social club mixer.  Maybe this is a good thingâ¦ maybe itâs keeping us young at heart.  But it remains a fact that folk are less willing to take on the responsibility that their folks and grandfolks took up at a much younger age.     	Thereâs another angle to this phenomenonâ¦ and itâs the reason I started this article.  I was sort of typing and filling space until I found the connection, and then BAM!  There it is.  Weâre living longer, and also staying younger longer BECAUSE our forefathers had done things to promote a newer, shinier reality.  We are growing older more slowly because we have the benefit of their mistakes.    We have a history.   Iâve seen 2001: a space odyssey many times, and I love the whole movie, but one of the most interesting parts is in the beginning, with all the crazy monkeys.  Theyâre monkeying around, drinking water and being generally simian, when the monolith descends and sort of speeds up their evolution.  And the one monkey (I think his name was moonwatcher in the book, but donât quote me)  is playing with the predatorâs bone one hot desert day and comes to the realization that he can use it to bonk other creatures on the head.    A lot of people think (and I donât necessarily disagree) that Monkeyface realizes he can use things as tools, and this is what makes him powerful enough to overcome the jaguar and the enemy tribe of monkeys, and eventually overcome the barriers of the earth itself.  We humans are hailed as the great toolmakers; we possess gadgets and objects of infinite intricacy and usefulness.  And we have the opposable thumbs to use them.  I love using them, myself, Iâm looking at my shiny (though not much more useful than a piece of paper) Palmtop Computerâ¦ a cigarette lighter (fire is officially our bitchâ¦ take that, animal kingdom!)  plastic bottles, even the computer Iâm using now.    But I think the fact that we are toolmakers is only a part of the equation.  All sorts of animals use tools.  Chimps use sticks to root out anthills, scratch their backs, et cetera.  Even without the opposable thumb we wave in front of them derisively, they still can make use of things not of their bodies.    So is it communication?  We have a wonderful language that allows us to convey things, like telling a fellow that a potted plant is about to fall on their head, or that you would like a hot dog with Cappyâs sauce upon it.    But thatâs not it eitherâ¦ animals communicate too, at least on some level.   Birdâs mating callsâ¦ gorilla gestures, screeching warnings.  And perhaps more useful than even our language is the hive mind, allowing flocks of birds to intuitively move as one while migrating, silently striding packs of wolves hunting, ants almost instantly knowing where food isâ¦ the ability to work as a unit makes for a great deal of efficiency (At the cost of individuality, which is why cellphones and Instant Messenger scare me, but thatâs another post altogether)  Neither toolmaking nor communication is manâs secret weapon, and although weâre damn good at it, weâre not the only game in town.  Youâd think that animals, communicating and using tools for so many eons, would eventually get better at it, but they donât.    Besides, tools and communication fail.  Weâre at the mercy of our dayplanners.  Things that should be making us more time in fact give us less free time.  Hunters and gatherers had all day to look around and dream, once the berries and carcasses were all in the nomadic village.  It is this dreaming that really started the whole thing.  Tools seem almost counterintuitive; are we using the tools, or are the tools using us?  Communication, for all its flowery eloquence, also fails us.  Thereâs no real way of being sure that what we convey is that which is understood by those who receive.  Feelings might be universal, but for all we know, all perception is unique.  You and I do not feel the same anger, the same love, the same sadness, we donât see the same car, the same hot blonde, the same color red.  For all of our wonderful words and objects, we remain, by and large, island universes.  We have nothing except a collectively shared, yet individually experienced, past.  History is what the beasts do not have.  They have instinct (which is badass, but thereâs not much choice in it) but itâs way too slow.  An animal will be killed at the hands of men for generations upon generations before they get it into their heads that the bipeds are not to be trusted.  The life, and experience of an animal ends with that animal.  It passes on its genes, makes a baby wolf, and the instinct and the cycle continue.  Wolves canât sit around the forest grove, fondly remembering Grandpa One Eye, reminiscing about how he once outsmarted the bobcat that one time, and wasnât it funny as hell?    The scene in 2001 is less about a single monkey learning how to use a bone as a weapon, and more about that monkey coming to the realization that his actions, and the actions of his brothers, can have a lasting effect on the world.    History is communication to the nth degree.  Our past is what allows us to grow older and stand on the shoulders of our ancestors and make improvements on their innovations.  It allows us to observe both personal and collective progress within our lifetimes.  It gives us a bar which is silently begging to be jumped over and raised.  Our communications and our tools are only symptoms of our understanding of what has come before.  Our past has given us a future.  But when you really get down to it, our history is flawed.  Itâs written by the victors, so sayeth Napoleon, and many stories and innovations are lost.  Misinformation and propaganda paint unreal pictures of the way things are.  Violent crime in this country decreases, and yet the mediaâs reporting of violent crime increases exponentially.  The powers that be understand the power of history, and use it to control reality.  We begin to see that what weâre taught about our past isnât a really accurate picture.  The present becomes the past all too quickly these days.  Americans have short memoriesâ¦ I can remember the vigils held on October 11th, 2001, the vows to never forget the attack upon our nation.  I remember the moment of silence on the radio on September 11th, 2002.  But this past year?  I donât remember a single thing, save some idle chatter on msnbc.  Itâs being pulled out again for the sake of election campaigns, but it will once again fade into obscurity, adorning the pages of history books as a footnote for the beginning of the 21st century.    History is our salvation, our opiate, and ultimately, our crutch and our untimely demise.  More and more information is out there these days, thanks to the internetâ¦ but the net is in a state of constant flux.  Websites change, but there is no record of what came before it.  Itâs going too fast.  Instinct has the benefit and disadvantage of being slow, it seems.  It takes its time and makes DAMN sure that the information is good and correct.  It does so at the cost of individual members in the species.  If our information age were to fail, what then?  Tribes of barbarians, sweeping through the streets of cities, destroying history. It would be the fall of Rome, all over again.  The Dark ages.  A time to gather together in the hollow shells of our technology, and try to piece together what we lost. We donât have the benefit of a rich oral tradition, save a collective memorization of the Adam Sandler âHanukkah Songâ.  We couldnât teach our children much more than survival.  If a dark age were to come upon us right now, our wonderful and terrible tools would rust, unused, unknown.  150 years from now, buckskin clad great grandchildren would be drying hides on the interstates, smashing open skulls with back massagers. Needless to say, it would be a considerable setback.  So I was wrongâ¦ history isnât the answer.  Now, bear with me.  Perhaps at the moment of cogitation, a new kind of organism was born: the Idea. Itâs a simpler sort of historyâ¦ and maybe history itself is an idea.  But think about how ideas work.  Passed from person to person, constantly mutating, spreading, dying out.  It sounds almost like a virus.  Maybe it isâ¦ a sort of electrical impulse virus soaring through words and feelings. Perhaps instinct is the evolutionary forefather of the idea, passed genetically, slowly...   Sprouting forth from instinct, Our brains were fertile grounds for the Ideas.  The mental capacity grew, and so grew innovation.  Designated as the vessels of ideas, we watch some of them grow, while some die on the vine.  Like the Gods we thought they were, Ideas have only to be forgotten to be killed. Stronger ideas seem to spread like wildfire, and sometimes two ideas that contradict have themselves a little conflict.  Holy wars, Inquisitions, Crusades.  And all the rest.  So are we at the whim of our ideologies?  Is it like some Douglas Adams novel, where lab mice are in control, and we are made to believe the opposite?  Are we the warships and Bentleys of a bunch of neurological impulses?  Are we just material side effects?  The fleshy housing of the abstract?  This seems to be a dismal way of looking at ourselves.  I like to think we ARE our abstractions, and we're sometimes caught up in the tangibility of it all.  Reality, expression, all of it is just a set of corporeal training wheels, itching to be taken off by some cosmic socket wrench.  We may someday transcend into pure energyâ¦ because after all, matter is simply energy that is trapped.  I look forward to the day when my great great Grandchildren (or grandnephews, Iâm not counting that particular chicken until sheâs in my bed) will shake off these obsolete earthly bindings, and float seamlessly into the Aether.  Maybe it will happen within my lifetime.  Innovation is happening more and more quicklyâ¦ Following the Ideas up to the present, Agriculture to Smithing, to Industry, to computers, to god knows whatâs been invented this weekâ¦ thereâs exponentially less time between leaps, and the distance each leap covers is growing exponentially the other way.  So in time, there will be a critical juncture, as these equations we call life reach their asymptotes, and everything will start happening very quickly.  So donât get caught with your pants down.  To quote an enlightened being who was trying to eliminate all the needless law and rhetoric (again, another post altogether), âRepent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand,â or somesuchâ¦ all I know is, itâs going to be a hell of a ride.  Our childhoods are lengthening because we need to have the limber minds of the young in order to transcend.  All this advancement, all this history, all these conversations could be preparing us for something amazing.  Maybe we need to cast off the tools and speeches and knowledge that has brought us this far, like booster rockets falling off of a space shuttle, hurtling towards the inky depths of space, expanding infinitely, and becoming what we were meant to be.   whether we like it or not, whether we KNOW about it or notâ¦  we are, all of us, constantly becoming.  Hereâs to 24.      --The Slater",male,24,Internet,Aries,0
378470,1510754,2004-07-01,"One Year for Every Hour: Birthday Reflections    So it comes to this - birthday comes and strips away a year of youthâ¦ slaps on a shiny new coat of old. Everything is the same and everything is the same. I keep telling myself that itâs only a yearâ¦ that the big difference is saying â24â instead of â23ââ¦ is it?â¦ am I?? Havenât I changed? Is this some kinda trick?  I have.  I wasnât losing my hair at fifteen. I know that. I was all about getting feminine stinky on my âhang downâ. I didnât drink and hardly smoked. I masturbated like I would win something if I could justâ¦ blowâ¦ oneâ¦ moreâ¦ loadâ¦ and I was getting laid on a fairly regular basis. My sex drive could have powered 31 city blocks. I was wonderfully naÃ¯ve, impossibly beautiful, and goddamn indestructible. Cruel, really â no one should remember being that young.   Who am I kidding?   That was nine years ago! Thatâs all. I have changed. But when? Everything always looks the same when I glance back just one year. Is the change that subtle? I think it isâ¦  I should do something.  I should work out.  Iâm out of shape. Iâm not a big guyâ¦ I just want to be able to run a little and not be so worn out or in so much pain after I decide to pick up a piece of sports equipment. I want to be able to wear t-shirts and maybe even show off my arms. Fat people can be cruel. I wish I was one of them. They get all of the attention.  Working out will change things.  I should change my diet. Look at the crap Iâm eating! I complain about my health and my weight and then I sit down to the culinary equivalent of a swift kick to the âHoly Jehosephat!â (which I undoubtedly deserved)â¦ no wonder I feel like crap. I feel like crap because I eat like crap. Iâd get a personal trainer but I donât have the money. Thatâs it. From now on Iâm doing 50 push-ups every morning. This time I mean it.  I wonât follow through.   I never follow through. Not when it comes to this. Maybe one day Iâll be fat and happy.  Acne is gone! From my face anyway. Thereâs apparently an aggressive colony thatâs moved to my back. How sexy is that? I should use a special soap. I should condition my hair. Iâll pick those up.  I wonât pick those up. I never do.  I feel like I know myself too well to surprise myself anymore. Iâve got me pegged. Iâll plan and fantasize but, in the end, I wonât. In the end, I wonât. Iâll explain it away. Iâll find some way to put it off.  Maybe I donât always put it off.  I may. I think I do.  Iâm lonely. I really donât want to find someone, though. Itâs all about sex. No one talks anymore. What the hell is that about? What? How big is my what? Are you serious? So now I fall in love with anyone whoâs attractive thatâll talk to me. Thatâll show me some sign that theyâre interested in conversation.  Iâm pathetic.  Am I ranting?  Am I bitching?  Thereâs really no point. I say over and over that there are two options âDo something or do nothingâ. Iâm not sure of the true of that statement anymore. It sounds true though so Iâll stick with it.  I canât drink anything like I used to in college. I drink like old men at the bar drink.  My friends are too young.  I need a vacation from my problems.  Iâm happy.  I know whatâs going on. Thereâs still so much time to make a difference. To change. To make a difference. To change. I just have to figure out how? I know how. I mean I just have to figure out if I want to go. I know where I want to go. I just need to know how to get there. I hope itâs not far.  Everything is ok â proceed as planned.  I think Iâll be fine. Iâm sure Iâll at least be ok. I got plenty of scotch on my birthday. Sometimes I can be such a child. I think that admission deserves a drink.  24â¦ 23â¦ what the fuck am I complaining about? Iâm still young! Thereâs so much goddamn time ahead of me. What will I do? Things. How will I do them? Same way I always have.  There.   Thatâs better.  Though I should probably at least have a plan.  Iâm no good at making plans. I never stick to plan.  A good blowjob would clear my mind. Someone should get on that. Iâm right bored with masturbatingâ¦ which means I need to put it off for a while. Tuck that lilâ salve back in the medicine cabinet until next week. Why in Godâs name am I sharing this?  :::CENSORED:::  I should watch more TVâ¦ become more MTvâ¦ then Iâll feel younger. I worried about being âregularâ for the first time. I considered Rogaine. Whatâs happening to me?  :::breathing:::  One year for every hour. Thatâs how old I am. I think I maybe should start getting ready for 25. Thatâs a number I can work with.

378471,1510754,2004-07-01,"âHungry?â And Other Ridiculous Questions and Notions III: Donât they know Iâm as cool as a fan?   I like beer.  â¦a lot  â¦ Maybe too much butâ¦ well thatâs beside the point for now.  Iâve been boozing it up for years now and for the most part I canât complain. Booze is a cheap lilâ vacation in a bottle and Iâve spent the better part of my college career âtravelingâ. No worries â I now know that, though Scotland is a great place to visit damn near anytime time of year (so long as you have the stomach for it). Russia isnât some place youâd want to be very often. It gets a little dangerous.   Mexico is right out.   But enough of my booze euphemisms. Before I became the respectable lush that I am today, I was quite the glassy eyed pothead. I loved pot more than life itself. Granted, I was 14 when I took that first magic toke of smoke â stands to reason that I, like so many disillusioned youth, hated lifeâ¦ hell I would go as far as to say that I loved :::insert school lunch menu item here::: more than life.  Anywhoâ¦  [ donât they know Iâm as cool as a fan? ]  I smoked pot by the bale and, after a time, came to wonder about other drugs. I had always wondered about all drugs; cocaine, heroin, PCP, ecstasy â all of that fun stuff and more. I only delayed experimenting because of the lies my teachers had told me about what happens to people that do drugs. Youâve all heard them before and probably still believe the garbage they filled you with.  :::chuckle:::  Itâs hogwash but, for once, I wonât go the route of attempted enlightenment. Research for yourself the truth about drugs and what they can and can not do to your bodyâ¦ and your life for that matter. Suffice it to say that most people that use drugs recreationally or habitually live normal happy lives. The broken minority, however, gets all the pressâ¦  So be itâ¦.  I lost my fear of drugs entirely because of pot. After smoking pot, I found out that pot, at least, most likely wouldnât kill meâ¦ everâ¦   Ever.   I defy any of you readers to tell me of a death or serious injury directly related to pot. They are few and far betweenâ¦ and I guarantee the numbers for booze and cigarettes are hundreds of times higher. Too bad our forefathers didnât think to market all kinds of poison, eh?   [ Iâm not your average Joe. ]  Anywho, pot freed me from fear that had been imposed upon me by my lying teachers and their lying books and pamphlets. Had I more cash (and were I a little braver and younger), Iâd certainly give a number of drugs a try. Here they are in no particular order:     urlLink  Shrooms    Shrooming is at the top of my list of things to doâ¦ by which I mean after Iâve gotten over my seemingly irrational âfearâ of them. In all honesty, I think Iâm more excited than afraid though I certainly am a little apprehensive about having a bad trip. I do hope, though, that one day this fear will have dissipated thus making my palette a prime target for those shadow grown dreamweavers. Iâm dying for a taste of that secret knowledge.  [ Iâll be anything you need ]   urlLink  Cocaine   	 I want to know what all the buzz is about. Coke used to be such a cool drug back in the 80âs. I mean nothing was more rock star than doing lines off of a hookerâs ass before a show. If you want my opinion, I think Don Johnson and Cindy Lauper fucked it up for the rest of us. Now coke has more or less become a Wall Street drug. Hell, even shitty models and porn stars donât snort anymoreâ¦ which is a shame because Iâll bet thatâs how they managed the waif look.  [ Play the game ]   urlLink  Heroin    You read that right. I want to take a ride on the âHâ train. And, thanks to some creative junkies, you donât have to inject heroin all up in your arm-piece :::turntable scratch:::. Thatâs right! You can snort that shit, B! So that rocks. But I have more experience with smoking than anything else and heroin is smokable as well so... I mean there you go. Iâm mostly worried about addiction and being able to âhandle my highâ. As far as addiction goes, though, Iâm already riding one helluva snake with nicotineâ¦ which beats heroin hands down in the dependency department   Interesting heroin factoid:  An estimated 25 to 40% of street users are not physically dependent   Now that's something to think about. If heroin were cooler and had less of a back-alley junkie vibe, Iâd probably have given it a whirl already. As it stands now, I just donât have the cash or the drive.  [ Canât nobody break my stride ]    urlLink PCP/Ketamine    I have no idea what they do and, quite frankly, I donât care. Who among you readers can boast having done up the night with PCP? I sure as hell canât. And Special K? Man oh man! The name alone is more enticing than Shannon Elizabeth in that pie fucking movie. I shoâ ânuff want me some oâ that! But seriously, I think what draws me to PCP (or Ketamine [special K]â¦ a weaker and less toxic version of PCP) is the mystery of it all. Whatâs it do? My pals at Thegooddrugsguide.com had this to say:   âAt low doses, K is a mild if weird stimulant. At medium to high doses, it becomes a very powerful paralysing psychedelic. It effects are like a combination of cocaine, cannabis, opium, Nitrous Oxide, and alcohol.â   â¦I mean so there you go right there.   [ Suddenly life has new meaning to me ]   urlLink  LSD     	:::ahem::: The most powerful mind-altering substance known to man. I think Iâm done here.  [ Meet me in outer space ]    Iâm really in search of a step down from nicotineâ¦ something a littleâ¦ I dunnoâ¦ sexier, you know? Nicotine is so bromidicâ¦ so clicheâ¦ so damn uninspiring. I need a drug with a bit more oomph, a little more class, and a hell of a lot more sass. A drug I can bring home to mama. A back alley drug with high class appeal. An uptown drug with downtown sensibilitiesâ¦ a girl-next-door drug with leather dungeon fantasiesâ¦ dig? A missionary position drug with âknee padâ capabilities if you catch my drift.  Right now, Iâm pretty much waiting for prices to level off before I start investing. That or Iâll just have to wait until Iâm a rock starâ¦ fucking slurping LSD out of a hookerâs bellybutton while taking a liquidy dump in her faceâ¦ only a matter of time.  Donât be afraid of drugs.

378472,1510754,2004-07-01,"Damn, didnât I used to write for this disturbing genital sore of a website? Itâs been way too longâ¦   Anyways, some quick updates, and then a little bit oâpostinâ for the chillins.  First off, Iâm sure youâve heard the rumors about BEER AND PORN RADIO, and Iâm here to tell you that they are TRUE. BEER AND PORN RADIO is in the works, and weâre hoping to bring the same depraved, offensive commentary to you in audio form sometime in the next few months. How will it work, you ask? The stream will be broadcast from the Internet on demand, meaning youâll be able to listen to each episode at your own leisure, whenever you wish! Most importantly, the stream will be FREE! Thatâs right, no need to scour porn and warez sites looking for Beer n Porn MP3s â just follow the links from right here on the site and your virgin ears will be basted in the love juice we call social commentary. Check the site often for more details.  Second, weâve recently added a new feature to BEER AND PORN. If you look above the posts youâll see a link for the BEER AND PORN MESSAGE BOARDS. Hereâs your chance to interact with others who waste their time reading Beer and Porn, along with the depraved souls who author the crap you read here every day! Itâs free to sign up, and within minutes youâll be trading sexually explicit jokes with the rest of us here at Beer and Porn! A word of caution â nothing on the board is censored, so if you have a weak soul or are prone to being offended, itâs best if you move on to something a little more tame, like the Disney online store or something. Otherwise, weâd love to have you!  Third, itâs time for a little shout out. Weâre always excited to hear about Beer and Porn fans from around the globe. Your pal and mine, Mr. Dexter Otis Green, has done a fan-freakin-tastic job of tracking our readership across the globe. Recently, he identified the FIRST INSTANCE OF A PERSONAL WEBSITE LINKING TO BEER AND PORN! This is a monumental, historic moment in the annals of the Internet. Not only are people reading this tripe, but they are coming back, and they are TELLING THEIR FRIENDS! I am flush with pride and arrogance!  [DRUM ROLL, PLEASE]  Congratulations, AILIN from NOVA SCOTIA, CANADA! Weâve found your Beer and Porn link on your fantastic, award-winning webpage, and weâre here to say thanks! You are just the first step towards our eventual conquest of Canada, which we will use as the base for our global empire! You have earned yourself a high-ranking position in our eventual ruling government thanks to your obedience to the Beer and Porn movement! Har-har-har-ha! [Maniacal laughter and the twitching of fingers follows].  Seriously, Ailin, much appreciated. Drop us a line if you read this. Until then kiddies, visit her  urlLink website  and  urlLink weblog  and let her know how amazingly cool she is.   Moving on to the important stuffâ¦ Finally, the results of the last poll!    Who is -The Man?-   Whitey 130 (56%)   Jesus 6 (2%)   Whitey Pig Cops 8 (3%)   Ron Jeremy 17 (7%)   My mom, sadly. 69 (30%)   230 Total votes     Oh Jesus, you just couldnât cut it this time, huh? Sadly, the Son of God himself couldnât pull more than 2% of the overall vote. We tried to reach Mel Gibson for comment, but he was too busy counting the millions he made from preying on the devotion of the faithful to sell movie tickets to respond to our questions. Way to go Mel! If youâre such a good Christian, why donât you donate all those profits from the âPassionâ to charity? Iâm sure that $200 million will help you buy a nice comfy Lay-Z-Boy at the right hand of Jesus when youâre finally called from this Earth, huh?  Does anyone honestly think itâs a coincidence that âPassionâ was released around Ash Wednesday to coincide with the Easter season? Thatâs marketing, kids.   Coming in fourth was âWhitey Pig Cops,â which surprisingly only pulled 3% of the vote. I expected a little more voting love for the jerkoffs who continue to make the parking lots and side streets of the world safe with useless tickets while criminals are allowed to roam the streets raping, robbing and killing. Seriously. Ever see a bunch of cops eating lunch at a local restaurant, or grabbing coffee somewhere in the middle of the day? Ever want to just grab them by the throat and yell âHey buddy, how about getting in your damn Pigmobile over there and SOLVING A FEW CRIMES WHILE YOU EAT THAT DANISH????â Ever want to slash the tires of a dumb-ass cop whoâs pulled over someone for a minor traffic violation in the middle of rush-hour traffic, backing up cars for miles? Ever wonder why police only need a high school education to get a job? COPS ARE NOT YOUR FRIEND. THEY ARE NOT THERE TO PROTECT YOU. THEY ARE ONLY THERE TO PROTECT THE STATUS QUO.  Sorry, that wasnât very funny. But I hate cops. Moving on.  In third place was my man, Ron Jeremy. Ron pulled 7% of the vote, beating Jesus by 11 votes, and again proving that Beer and Porn readers are the smartest readers of all. Ron Jeremy is the unsung hero of the American Porn Industry, which grosses more money per year than Hollywood. This is the honest truth. Pornography funnels millions of dollars in tax revenue into state and federal coffers every year, and silently allows media conglomerates to make profits. The porn industry is also responsible for many technological advances, such as the VCR, DVD, streaming video on the internet, encryption technology, and other high-tech methods of data transfer. Ron Jeremy, along with the other stars of the porn industry, we salute you! Not only did you get me through puberty, but you keep the American economy afloat! Iâm going to celebrate with my Vivid DVDsâ¦  In second place, we have your mom. I must say that I expected your mom to be the dark horse candidate, but she couldnât put it all together in the end. I think we all know your momâs qualifications in the area, and I think itâs safe to say that all of us here at Beer and Porn have an intimate relationship with your mom and her abilities. Your mom could be reached for comment, but we chose not to, because we arenât interested in what she has to say, are we? Weâre interested in what she can doâ¦  Finally, the number one choice to the answer âWho is âThe Manâ?â â Whitey.  Speaking on behalf of Whitey, Iâd like to make a brief acceptance speech.  I am probably the closest thing to the stereotypical Whitey that you can find. Iâm white, for starters. Hopelessly white. Irish and Italian kind of white. Suburban Connecticut kind of white. Middle-middle class kind of white. Only child kind of white. The opposite of âdiversityâ kind of white. I put the âCâ in Caucasian. Iâm bland like Vanilla. I am the personification of Wonderbread. I fail to qualify for any scholarships. There are no outreach programs available to me. I am not protected by any equal opportunity mandates. I am not covered by any quotas. I am the reason for Affirmative Action. I have an albino soul. I am white.  I have been told from the day of my birth that I am bland and unoriginal. My ancestry is treated like potpourri trivia rather than a source of heritage or pride. My people, whoever they may be, are responsible for any and all social injustices you can find. I am responsible for slavery. I am responsible for patriarchy. I am responsible for the Jewish diaspora. I am responsible for the destruction of indigenous peoples in the Western Hemisphere. I am responsible for political lines in Africa and the Middle East that have destroyed tribes and caused civil unrest. I am the face of the Ku Klux Klan, of the Know-Nothing party, of National Socialism, of the Spanish Inquisition and untold other instruments of intolerance and cruelty. I am Big Tobacco. I am Big Government. I am Big Oil. I am Rich Uncle Pennybags, with a cigar in my mouth and a top hat on my head, running the world thanks to my white male privilege.  I am told that I run the show, and therefore I deserve no breaks. I am expected to prostrate repeatedly for the sins of my ancestors. I am afforded no breaks, no helping hands and no compassion. If I succeed, it is because of my white male privilege. If I fail, it is my fault and no one elseâs. I am not allowed to enter into discourse about society, because my views are inherently racist, sexist, classist and bigoted. I am the personification of the sins of the world.   I am white. I am apparently âThe Man.â   ---------------------  Itâs difficult to talk about such things without exposing your shortcomings in reasoning due to your position in society. One could look at my social stature and claim that I am a perfect example of white privilege: well educated, self-sufficient, soon to receive my graduate degree and become a member of professional academia. You could say that Iâve never had to struggle to reach my goals, or fight preconceived notions of my abilities based on societal stereotypes. I certainly couldnât argue with you â all I know is my own experience, and I canât say whether my path has been eased by my skin color and gender. Some would say that is the case â and who am I to argue?  This I think is the point of my ridiculous rant above. Itâs certainly fair to say that there are inherent social benefits to being male, or white, or both, in modern society. And it is just as important to expose these unfair advantages for what they are, as everyone should be afforded the same rights and opportunities in a truly free society. However, it often feels that as a member of white male America, I am immediately shut out of these discussions because of my perceived bigotry and/or involvement with the problems in society. Can a grown man speak about Feminism? Can a white man talk about racism? Iâd like to think so â but in Politically Correct America, Iâm afraid this may not be the case.  Anyways, on behalf of all Whiteys everywhere, Iâd like to apologize. Weâre trying our best to do the right thing. Weâre just not all that good at it. Blame the fall of the Roman Empire. It messed us up pretty good, you know.  -Mr. Carson",male,24,Internet,Aries,0
378473,1510754,2004-07-01,"Dexterâs Random Topic for Me:  Attractivness and Why Itâs Totally Fucked,   (or, âI like this porno, but thereâs too much dick in it.â)    One of my good friends said something recently that has lodged itself inside of my brain.  He said, âI feel shallow by not being gay or bisexual.â  I was sort of confused by the statement, so I asked for a qualifying backup statement, which he delivered in mildly slurred speech, âWellâ¦ it bothers me that somebody could possess all of the qualities I look for in someone I would want in a romantic partner, funny, good taste in musicâ¦ perfect compatibilityâ¦  and yet I would ignore them as a possible mate simply because it was a dude.â    	So I began to think about it, being confident in my own sexualityâ¦ and heâs got a point.  Why does gender play such a critical role in whatâs attractive?  I mean, think about it.  If you were living with Marvin instead of Mary, you could watch Sportscenter without getting a healthy dose of Lifetime Movie network during the commercial break.  Marvin wouldnât ask you what you thought about floral or printed curtains, or what you were thinking, period.  And deciding on whether to spend a weekend looking for deals at the Christmas tree shops or watching the Bond marathon and eating five successive meals at Wendyâsâ¦ no contest.   For mine own part, my brain is wired in a more traditional fashion.  Boys want to stick and girls want to be stuck. Tab A, Slot Bâ¦ separated locker rooms, call me old guard, call me chauvinistâ¦ whatever.  Thatâs the way I see it.  This is not to say that I am not totally accepting of other ways of being.  Iâm generally very laid back about that sort of thing, because, shitâ¦ it isnât hurting me, is it?  But my buddyâs drunken and philosophical comment made me stop and think about the whole male female matchup.  So here goes.  	Letâs face it.  Girls are crazy.  And not funny crazy like that homeless dude who tells his shopping cart about the governmental conspiraciesâ¦ theyâre crazy crazy.  The face painting, the shaving, the plucking, the morning ritualâ¦ the need for shoes.  Stand back and look at it from a detached, clinical perspective.  If she doesnât want to talk, donât bother.  If sheâs giving you the silent treatment, you Did Something.  Itâs best to close your eyes and ignore the wrathâ¦ because, for some reason, sheâll just be like, âI love you so much!â  and youâll do it like a million times.  And you are left with nothing but terrifying confusion, and the latent fear that you will someday do something to make her go away forever, and youâll never have any idea what it is.  Thatâs crazy.  	But let us also face another fact.  Girls are hot.  Damn hotâ¦ Real hot.  Scampering about in bathing suits and smilingâ¦ Jesus!  Itâs a beautiful thing.  And itâs not just the supermodels; Even real life girls are hot.  Furrowing their brows, trying to understand some chemistry formula, shopping on Saturday with a t-shirt and jeansâ¦ they sway, they reclineâ¦ they can contort themselves on easy chairs and fall asleep with their legs tucked underâ¦ like sexy little cats, or otters or something.  Itâs quite wonderful.    	I donât know what they see in guys.  The non supermodel forms of maledom are an unruly lot.  Leaving seats up, sniff testing underwear for second and third day use, sweat, hair, snoring, Defiled bathroomsâ¦ Weâre slobs.  And as my man Holden Caulfield said, the ones who look good on the outside are secret slobs.  Bedâs made every day, but look underneathâ¦ pizza boxes?  Using a mountain dew can for an ashtray for a month and a half.  Dusting?  Isnât that how they administer pesticides to crops?  Itâs a factâ¦ weâre kinda gross.  And by kinda, I mean Really Really.   	So, how can normal girls be so hot, and normal guys be so disgusting?  How does anything get done in this whacked out gene pool?  So I sat, and I thought for another little while. no more than twenty seconds or so...  And it occurs to me that we hetero males often put women on pedestals.  Despite their craziness, they really canât do wrong.  Itâs like theyâre aliens or something, and weâre all paunchy versions of Captain Kirk, Kicking ass and teaching them our ways of love.  They donât poop, they donât smell, they donât sweat (they glow!).  Because theyâre so mysterious, we think theyâre not disgusting.   Butâ¦ they are.  Girls are just sneaky.  And we men are willfully ignorant about it.  We block out those feminine hygiene commercials which seem to be misplaced during cool shows.  Blue liquid?  I can think of another primary color that might be a bit more apropos, considering the subject matter.  âNot so fresh feelingsâ?  It makes me wonder about what goes on inside the ladiesâ room.  And hereâs another little bit of info that came to my wide eyed attention, thanks to Sex and the City and nominally trustworthy femalesâ¦ girls talk about sex All The Time.  When weâre not around, of course.  And the DETAIL!  God Damn!  The way Iâve heard it told, it goes down to thrusts per minute, complete with elaborate and terrifying rating systems.  If you have ever had sex with a girl and she managed to escape your bedroom (or bathroom stall) alive, there is a group of women who youâve probably seen at parties who know every detail of your sexual methods.  Big Brother may or may not be watching, but Big Sister is a horrifying reality.  And she has a notebook.  	Iâm not sure where this is goingâ¦ I barely remember where it started.   *pause for scrollup*   Ok.  MY buddyâs drunken commentary on sexuality.  Iâm afraid Iâve gone on  a bit of a rant that has to do with it only tangentially, so Iâll try to wrap up.  Guys are straightforwardly gross, and see girls as statuesque psychopaths.  We are far too foolish and shortsighted to realize the awful truth.  Girls are sneakretly gross, and are realistic enough to know that real life guys donât have chiseled faces and six pack abs, or if they do, they will someday fade into jowls and a soft beer belly.  Iâ canât really say one way or another about dude/ dude and chick/ chick attraction, but it is reasonable to postulate that they follow a somewhat similar formula.  So in the end, weâre all disgustingâ¦ but the important part is that weâre all disgusting together.  Somewhere in the genetic soup we call this island Earth, we manage to find our way, and someday wake up next to a form that we find pleasant.  Cheers, kidsâ¦   -The Slater",male,24,Internet,Aries,0

Fail better.  -- Samuel Beckett    To begin, I have a request/âinformercialâ for all you non-smoking âwinnersâ out thereâ¦   Donât give me any more crap about quitting smoking.  Iâve heard enough of it.  Honestly. Iâve said this 1000 times before â Quitting smoking is harder than many non-smokers would believeâ¦ maybe a doctorâs note will get your attentionâ¦  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  â'Nicotine is  highly addictive , to a degree similar or in some respects  exceeding  addiction to 'hard' drugs such as  heroin  and  cocaine'   - Source ""Nicotine Addiction In Britain""  Report by Royal College Of Physicians â London  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Thatâs right â  frigginâ heroin â¦    Back off.   In fact, the only drug more addictive than nicotine is cocaine â which is, in fact, the most addictive substance known to man.   Non-smokers seem hell-bent on enlightening all of us idiot smokers as to the dangers of our vice. Hereâs a bit of  urlLink truth  for youâ¦  70 percent of smokers  want to quit . Only about 5% actually succeed every year. Every year, 95% of people who try to stop smoking are not successfulâ¦  Iâll say that last one againâ¦   95% of people who try to stop smoking are not successful.   Give me a break. Itâs fucking hardâ¦ and âNic Fitsâ arenât the worst of the withdrawl symptomsâ¦ thatâs right â symptoms pluralâ¦ Hereâs a chunk from the laundry list of withdrawl symptoms:   fatigue, lack of concentration, irritability, depression, anxiety, insomnia, (and an increased tendency to dreamâ¦ which actually isnât bad at all â sorry for wasting your time with that one), headaches, sleep disturbances, and increased appetite. These symptoms may begin within a few hours after the last cigarette. Symptoms peak within the first few days and may subside within a few weeks. For some people, however, symptoms may persist for months or longer... Oh and indigestion, nausea, diarrhea and sore throatsâ¦yesâ¦  all of them at the same time .   There you go, eh? Ainât THAT a bitchâ¦  And thatâs just the physical repercussions.  A number of smokers are addicted to the ritual of smoking - the feel, smell, and sight of a cigarette and the ritual of obtaining, handling, lighting, and smoking the cigarette are all associated with the happy times that smoking brings and can make withdrawal or craving worse. While nicotine gum and patches may alleviate the pharmacological aspects of withdrawal, cravings often persist. In other words, the patch and gum wonât work for someâ¦  at all.  Fun, eh?  And, believe it or not, most of us smokers are hip to this jive. We know well enough what smoking does to us becauseâ¦ well weâre living the dream, kids. We also have intimate knowledge of how hard (damn near impossible) it is to quit smoking becauseâ¦ well most of us have tried and failed numerous times. So to you non-smokers who are harping on us to âjust quitâ, give it a rest already. Your constant bleatings arenât helping. Weâre wrestling with forces all but unknown to you â your efforts are certainly appreciated butâ¦ well damnâ¦ leave us alone. Weâll get thereâ¦ your pressure isnât helping at all. Thereâ¦ all done with that  :::adjusting tie:::  :::stepping down from soapbox:::  This whole deal is really about my latest failed quitting smoking effort. About two months ago I decided to give it the olâ college try and clear the air. And, believe it or not, I was doing pretty good for a while there. My plan this time (probably gleaned from some online remedy mag or some such)  was to keep a diary recording each and every cigarette that I smoked â thatâs rightâ¦ every oneâ¦ time, date, and, get this, motivationâ¦ awww yeah! I thought keeping a diary would be encouraging, you know? Iâd see my smoking decreasing over time and get a confidence boost. âleast thatâs how it was supposed to work. I printed my quit date in HUGE letters and numbers on the front of the damn thing and, for a while, I was excited about the prospect of being smoke free. Then.. well things fell apart.

Talk about frustrating. Something happened, though, that made me rethink quitting altogether.  I was at work and a man came up to the counter. He looked like he had been in a washer and dryer set to âOldâ for most of his life. One of the two of his yellowing eyes was split open a bit at the bottom and :::gag::: it was oozing thick yellowishâ¦ schtuff.  :::Christ:::  Oh but it gets better. He had SEVERAL holes in his neck and to talk to me he had to use one of those doohickeys that makes folk sound like Robot Jones. On top of all of this, he only had enough breath to utter one word at a time. He used what could have very been the last of his breaths to say these three wordsâ¦  Skoalâ¦  â¦Wintergreenâ¦  â¦Longcutâ¦  :::SHIT!:::  Now THATâS a fucking addiction.   (note: Skoal is smokeless or âchewingâ tobacco â Wintergreen is a flavor they offer and longcut is one of two varieties of Skoal[the other being âfine cutâ] â¦ thus Skoal Wintergreen Longcut is what he was asking for â visit http://www.ussmokeless.com/ for more info)   Iâve done some pretty terrible things in my lifetime but damn it if this wasnât one of the absolute worstâ¦ I sold it to him. Every part of me knew that it was wrong to do soâ¦ that I should have said ânoâ and let myself be fired or just quit on the spot or somethingâ¦ anything demonstrating a little moral backbone. But no, I sold it to him and got regret and nightmares in return.  After that, I started to notice more and more how many people come in for their fix of nicotine â people with sickly eyes yellowing fingernails and brown teethâ¦ people breathing heavier than any pedophile or phone sex operator could ever dreamâ¦ people carrying the sick stink of tobaccoâ¦ dead people really. A third of the people Iâve sold that shit to will die from it. These are people who otherwise lead normal lives. These are people who started smoking to piss off their parents or because their brother did or to fit in with the cool kids or any other number of reasons. These are people, most of them, who donât want to be thereâ¦ standing in front of me and asking for deathâ¦ People tired of being a slave to a few ounces of dried leaves.. These people donât want to smoke.  I remember back to those bullshit drug education courses in grades 1-12â¦ I remembered all the bogus reports we had to do and all the little factoids we had to swallow and regurgitate on paper. I remember mostly how smoking was never made out to be a big deal. Heroin, coke, speed, PCPâ¦ hellâ¦ even alcohol and marijuanaâ¦ THOSE were the bad guys. Tobacco was just their naughty underlingâ¦ a clever parrot on the shoulder of a big bad pirate.  â¦right.  :::shaking head:::  I havenât yet given up on quitting smoking. Iâll make it soon enough. Picking up smoking was a huge mistake that me and millions of other people have made. We had no idea what we were getting into and, what with social whatnots being what they are, smoking is okâ¦ even cool. It isâ¦ honestly. Imagine James Dean without oneâ¦ see?  Anywho, Iâm actually gonna go have a cigarette. Not only for the sake of irony but alsoâ¦ wellâ¦ Iâll fucking bite the head off of a nun if I donât suck down some poison. This oneâs for you, weird eye dying guyâ¦ Iâll quit for both of us.  -- Dexter Otis Green",male,24,Internet,Aries,0
378475,1510754,2004-07-01,"I Believe in Santa: My Secret Shame   A few years ago, I was sweating out a gorgeous fall day in the stands of Memorial Stadium (RIP) with 249 of my closest friends. One friend in particular had been telling some interesting stories (lies, I called them) and today was the day of proof. Iâd heard a million whoppers and tall tales:   âMy dad is the President of Reebokâ  âI just signed with Virgin Recordsâ  âIâm pregnantâ  But I think this kid took the cake with this particular unbelievably outrageous bullshit story.  âMy Dad is Santa Clausâ   â¦  (see the archives for my feelings on Christmas)  â¦  :::share my rage:::   HA! â Santa isnât real! Period!... and this kid was gonna pay for his lies. He must have meant that his dad  looked  like Santaâ¦ âcause there was no way in his Pop was the genuine article. This day, I waited like a bear-trap to meet Santa. Believe or not, this wasn't the first time I had waited for the man.  When I was a kid, I remember waiting on Christmas Eve at my bedroom window for Father Christmas. I waited until I fell asleep with my cheek and ear pressed against the frosted window pane. I wanted to see himâ¦ just once. Waking up the next morning and seeing presents wasnât enough for me. I needed to see him with my own eyes. But, alas, it was not yet to be. I lost all faith in Santa. As far as I was concerned, my mother and father bought the presents. And that was fine by me.  This day at a football game in Memorial Stadium would be different. The kid pointed over to where his parents were sitting. My eyes scanned the crowd past a million sets of ice blue eyes and graying beardsâ¦ my gaze tumbled over hundreds of bellies thatâd shake like a bowl full of jelly butâ¦ none of them Santa-like.  And then it happened like it always does. My eyes stopped moving before I had known that I had found him and there he was. I couldnât believe it! There, sitting in the bleachers with a snow white beard and a yule log smile was frigginâ Santa Claus. This was bullshit!. Part of me hastened to explain it away.   âHe dressed up a little more like Santa today to fool you- to make you believe â he knows the stories. Heâs just living up to them!â   But he wasnât dressed in anything particularly Santa-ish. I knew it was him, though. I knew. And then he started waving a big glove in one hand, the other arm wrapped around Mrs. Claus  (oh yeah.. she was there tooâ¦ and sheâs crazy hot!... I actually wrote a song about itâ¦ but thatâs another story, isnât it Jake)  and I swear to God, I blinked harder than I may have ever blinked in my life.  It WAS him.  Iâve believed since. Even before I scrambled over aluminum benches and concrete stairs to meet him, I knew it was him. Now for a guy whoâs always calling for evidence, itâs downright hypocritical of me to make a claim as big as this one without one single shred of evidence.   But you havenât met him.  Once you meet him, youâll believe. He has something that none of those bullshit Mall Santas and run-of-the-mill big jolly old guys donât have. I donât know what it is, man, but itâs there.   Something about those eyesâ¦ he has the look of a kid whoâs been playing in the snow all day. And when he talks, itâs always like story timeâ¦like drinking hot chocolateâ¦ like listening to all the greatest oldest stories youâve ever heard all at onceâ¦ and with arms like that, the man could frigginâ punch a hole in the Pope â no questionâ¦ smart money says he can bench at least 350â¦   â¦sorry ladiesâ¦ heâs taken...  I made friends with Santa and itâs been nothing but good times ever since. He promised me some Clementine Oranges and  Leer jetâ¦ not bad, eh? Tip for all you would be Santa pals..  There is no limit to the amount of tequila this man can put away.  :::hangover:::   That about does it â Santa is a very real person. All the holly jolly whatnots we heard as kids turned out to be true. Call me insane if you want â I know that you donât know any better so Iâll forgive you. Besides, who cares what you think.  I believe in him.    --  Dexter Otis Green",male,24,Internet,Aries,0
378476,1510754,2004-07-01,"Hello again all you BeernPornophiles! Itâs been a long, long time since my last post, and thereâs been a lot of changes in the world of Mr. Carson â not the least of which is the addition of a Mrs. Carson. Yes, I have been emasculated at the altar of holy sacrament and public policy, and my rights and powers as a single male in American society have been stripped by a cruel and unforgiving mistress who used the promise of guaranteed intimacy to lure me into her evil estrogen prison of monogamy and reproduction. Zounds!   But enough of my troubles. Iâll speak of love and marriage another time. Right now, there is a more pressing issue that I need to speak about. It is an issue that threatens to tear apart the very social fabric of this great country. Itâs a lifestyle choice that is being forced upon us everywhere we look, in our towns, cities, neighborhoods and places of business. It is a deplorable, immoral attitude towards acceptable social behavior, and it must be stopped.  Worst of all, it has its roots in France.  What am I speaking of, you ask? I can sum it up in one simple sentence.  [ahem]  â¦  â¦   YOU ARE NOT LANCE ARMSTRONG .       See that photo? That is  Lance Armstrong, 5-time Tour De France winner, all-American hero, world-class cyclist, model athlete and cancer survivor.   This is you:           ...  Again, Lance Armstrong:      Iâd like you to notice a few important points about Lance Armstrong:  1)	Heâs a professional athlete, which is clear from his professional sponsorship (U.S. Postal Service) 2)	Being a professional athlete, he wears performance equipment for his cycling competitions. His lycra uniform is made to increase his aerodynamic profile, allowing him to reach faster speeds with less effort. 3)	He has the chiseled jaw and smooth, powerful musculature of a  MAN WHO HAS SURVIVED CANCER.   Now, a few important points about you:      1)	You are NOT a professional athlete, which is clear from your COMPLETE LACK OF PROFESSIONAL SPONSORSHIPS. Just because you have âHuffyâ written across the ass of your spandex racing pants does not mean you are PAID TO WEAR THE LOGO. 2)	 Not being a professional athlete, you have NO REASON to wear performance-enhancing equipment. If I wanted to, I could walk my fat couch-potato ass down to the Sports Authority, buy a helmet, shoulder pads and cleats. I could even get the helmet spray painted with the New England Patriots logo if I wanted to, and buy myself a Richard Seymour jersey. Does this make me a NFL Defensive End? FUCK NO. It makes me an asshole with a Patriots helmet on.  3)	You have the unshaven jaw and light skin tone of a PERSON WHO WORKS IN A CUBICLE ALL DAY. Note the complete lack of overcoming any life-threatening illness. Important note â riding for a cancer charity DOES NOT EQUATE YOU WITH A CANCER SURVIVOR.    YOU ARE NOT LANCE ARMSTRONG.   Most of us would like to think that we are original, that we have original ideas, original interests and original outlooks on life, society and spirituality. Sadly, you are mistaken. We all are, in fact. Anything you do, say, think, write, draw, paint, create, sing, create or destroy has easily been done hundreds of times over in the past â and is probably being done right now. Even those dirty little sexual pastimes you engage in when no oneâs around are â sadly â nothing new. The best we can hope for is to belong to a smaller group of similar-minded zombies than the next door neighbor, as that may afford you a certain measure of self-confidence as you delude yourself into thinking you are a paragon of originality.  Oh I see, so youâve actually been a fan of Texas Hold-âem Poker your entire life, huh? Suuuuuuure. Like you even knew what the fuck a âflopâ was until the World Series of Poker started to run on repeat play on ESPN2.       This might be you â if you replaced the pile of cash with a bag of Chee-tos, the poker chips with pennies and nickels, and the casino with your dorm room. IâLL SEE YOUR PENNY AND RAISE YOU A DIME! NO LIMIT, WOO HOO!!  Anyways, back to the bikers. I have absolutely no problem with bicycles. Theyâre a marvelous invention, they serve a practical purpose, and they represent a health-conscious and environmentally friendly method of public transportation. Plus, theyâre a fond reminder of the joys of youth, when whole weeks could be wasted riding your bike with your friends through the dirt paths of the woods behind your house, or the streets around your neighborhood. Bikes are cool.  You, sadly, are not.  Much like the poker craze sweeping the sexually inactive twentysomething population like the Dungeons and Dragons of yore, bicycle riding is becoming the recreation of choice for young professionals, thanks to the success of Lance Armstrong and the popularity of the Tour de France on national TV. Oh wait, sorry, itâs âcycling.â Youâre not riding a bike, youâre âcycling,â and âcyclingâ requires training and skill, right? It also requires a bike worthy of your athletic prowess, right? One with thirty-three gears, swept-back grips, sweat-resistant seats and aerodynamic fins around the handlebars, right? And letâs not forget the skin-tight lycra bodysuit, and the aerodynamic polypropylene helmet, and the professional racing gloves, and the Nike performance cycling sneakers, and the water bottle full of performance enhancing hydrating sports drink from GNC, right? Itâs only the best for Mr. Cyclist, right?  Yet somehow, with all the professional equipment and the performance-enhancing clothing, you still manage TO CLOG UP THE ENTIRE FUCKING ROAD WITH YOUR SLOW ASS.      Notice that none of these people are LANCE ARMSTRONG. Notice how none of them are racing in the TOUR DE FRANCE. Yet notice how they seem perfectly content keeping the motorist behind them blocked from utilizing the roadway. Iâm sure those streamlined helmets help to increase your max speed to 9 MPH, but you mind getting out of the MIDDLE OF THE FUCKING ROAD please?  Iâm sure that some of you were âcycling enthusiastsâ long before Lanceâs historic feats, but I guarantee that 95% of the cockwads I see on the roads every day in their one-step-away-from-fetish-quality latex racewear clogging up my daily commute are Lance-o-philes who only started riding their bikes around like little kids in the past few years.  Please.  Hereâs a few important points to remember next time you plan on going for a bike ride:  1)	Unless you are competing in an official race, leave the spandex at home. 2)	Sadly, no matter how hard you try, you are slower than motorized vehicles. Therefore, please try your hardest to STAY OUT OF THE FUCKING ROAD. Itâs called a âshoulder.â Stay on it. 3)	The Department of Motor Vehicles, along with the Police Department, treats bicycles the same as motorized traffic. This means a cyclist must follow ANY AND ALL TRAFFIC DIRECTIONS AND SIGNS. This means you STOP at a RED LIGHT. This means you YIELD at a YIELD SIGN. This means you STAY WITHIN THE YELLOW LINES. This means the next time you weave your bike through traffic at a busy intersection in front of my car and run the red light, cutting off cars and stopping traffic a mile down the road, I will calmly leave my vehicle and administer a STATE-SPONSORED BEATDOWN OF BIBLICAL PROPORTIONS on your ass. 4)	Whether you work in a factory, an office building or a Taco Bell, you have a uniform you have to wear to work. Overalls, power suit or smock, itâs all the same when you break it down. There is no job in the world other than the job of BEING LANCE ARMSTRONG that requires you to wear a BRIGHT YELLOW SPANDEX SUIT to work in. Walking in to work at the beginning of your shift in âcycling gearâ does not make you cool. It makes you an outcast, and guarantees you a stoning at the hands of your co-workers straight out of a Shirley Jackson short story.  Bike riding can be a fun and rewarding exercise. Unless you are blocking my car from driving at state-sponsored speeds. Then it becomes a life-or-death situation for you.  Remember,  YOU ARE NOT LANCE ARMSTRONG.    Leave the cycling to people who know what theyâre doing.  And get out of my way.  -Mr. Carson",male,24,Internet,Aries,0

Picked up Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and started digesting that parchment truffle. Wandered around Boston for about 4 hours with a friend (Colin â yes he isâ¦ no we didnât â shame on you) who showed me a great many of Bostonâs offerings. After scarfing more BK, I headed back to the apt and tried in vain to porn surf without a mouse. Iâm telling you now itâs damn near impossibleâ¦ damn nearâ¦  [ahem]  After that little adventure, Sean stopped over and we played and sang on my roof for a while. You know, the little things ear making this whole move worth while â singing at the top of my lungs on a foreign roof veiled in cigarette smoke, warm tar underfoot with unlearned strangers undoubtedly mumbling anonymous critiques, laughing at the sky for no damn reason, daring the clouds to rain on that perfect settingâ¦ [sigh]  Magic.  We ambled in shaking with equal parts laughter and cold â Boston had been playing it cool all afternoon and it was time for yours truly to get indoors. Inside? We chatted for a while and then went mouse hunting. [note: I forgot my mouse and have been using nothing but keyboard commands] By then it as close to 9pm and, wouldnât you know, there were no mice to be had.   An ATM beckoned nonetheless and Sean and I decided it would make a perfect studio. We made ourselves right at home amidst the eggshell flood lights and pea-green monitors. I got a very quick guitar lesson before the ATM room was filled with patrons who apparently didnât agree with our studio idea. Undaunted and armed with Seanâs Ibanez, we made grand fools of ourselves traveling the streets of Boston improving blues [Anybody Got Drawz foâ Lease?] and generally jarring the drowsy public with Seanâs great guitar and my shameless singing. Somehow we made it across street and past several cock-eyed passersby and settled on my stoop. Chilled but triumphant, we climbed the stairs to my apartment babbling in the language of satisfied men.  Once inside, we chatted the night away â light fare really; God, the universe, and everything. Before too long, the digital clock bade Sean home and, after walking him down, I headed up to be alone in my palace.  It simply does not get better than this.",male,24,Internet,Aries,0
378478,1510754,2004-07-01,"So here I am in Bostonâs Back Bay area just a stoneâs throw away from the from the famed Jillianâs and a drunken quarter-mile stumble from Copley Square. Fenway is within shouting distance, The Boston Conservatory is literally across the street, and the Prudential Building vies for my attention amidst a sea of various apartment building and hostels outside my window.  Beantown, baby. Fâing fabulous.  I guess I should start from the beginning of all of this...  About a week ago I was working at my deluxe-all-time-sweet job at the XxtraMart when I get a phone call. âHowâd you like to live in Boston for the summer and play with my band for free?â, came the phone on the other end. My best friend was ecstatic with the news and I stood there with the receiver to my ear bleating âyesâ like a bored chick getting dry humped by some neâer-do-well in the back seat of a beaten sedan at the drive in.  Money.  This is what I had been waiting for. An unbelievable opportunity had just fallen into my lap and I wasnât about to turn it down. I hung up the phone after making him promise to fill me in on the details when I got back to my apartment and spent the rest of my shift with a $1,000,000 smile and an erection that only a well worn hooker could love. A week later, my crap backed into so many bags and/or flung carelessly into the trunk of my roommates car, I scurried up to Boston sporting the same unbelievable thumper.  I met my buddy outside of the New England Conservatory and we ferried him over to what was to be my apartment. After 30 min of one-way street denials, we finally pulled up to a modest five-story yellow painted brick building. We carried my crap up the 4 flights of stairs to the top floor, piled it onto the couch, and, after a few brief words and some gas money, my ride headed for the hills. Sean suggested I head over to his place to hang out and well by gosh golly gee I did. We hopped the T (train) and I spent the night playing guitar and generally catching up with Sean. Morning came and I rode the T back to my part of town so that I could get my things organized.  Things took a turn.  On the way to the T the night before, we took a roundabout route that led us to some quality dining at Burger King (sweet!). Needless to say, I couldnât just retrace my steps from the night before. But so what! I confidently stepped off of the train saddled with my trombone and a newly acquired GUI-tar and started hoofing in the general direction of my apartment.  After about 10-15 min, I found the street I live on but, wouldnât you know it, that fucker was long! I knew I was close to my apartment but I didnât know whether it was to the left or to the right. Whatever. I was in a dandy mood and took my chances heading left. 6 blocks of unfamiliar territory changed my mind and, making a quick pivot, I headed in the opposite direction. That way lead to the same âI donât knowâsâ and I found myself lost. What a fucking tourist. Luckily, I spied a pair of Bostonâs finest, and, after some debate, shambled over to them burdened with the instruments.  And thatâs when it happened.  âHey guys, Iâm lostâ, is all I said. The response? âYou lookinâ for the Boston Symphony?â said the lady cop... in Boston-ese. I was thrilled! My very first Boston accent! I stood there trying not to smile like a child-molester and hung on their every word. She and her likewise linguistically gifted chum pointed me in the right direction and finally, heaving and panting, I found my apartment.   Over the next few days, I was like a priest at an all-boys camp for the mute. I even got in touch with another friend of mine and had a couple beers in a sketchy ass Latino ghetto (in which I got lost).  Today? â I had French Toast and Meat (swear to godâ¦ thatâs how itâs listed on the menu), finally got my computer up and running, finished a novel, smoked my weight in cigarettes, and rocked out hard on some guitar. I was in such a good mood, the gunshots in the alley outside my window hardly phased me!  Iâm here for at least this summer but, hell, if things go well I wouldnât be opposed to living in this town. So what if I have to spend part of my day dodging homeless panhandlers and partially-toothed Mexican psychopaths (true story). Iâm in Fâinâ Beantown, baby!",male,24,Internet,Aries,0

Feel free to   urlLink go back   to that essay and catch up if you must.  Now, however, it is time to move on to the next whore of life...  Stephen Hillenburg . May his children know always the deep love of a stranger from behind.   Bio, crime, sentence of:  Stephen Hillenburg - Creator of Sponge Bob Square Pants     Bio   It was an unusually warm and homoerotic August afternoon in 1961.  Bigâol Blue Hillenburg  (or ""The guy who is totally not fucking queer"" as he is known to his friends... ""that guy"" for short) wiped his sweaty heterosexual brow with the back of a calloused hand and stared into an Oklahoma sky shimmering with hectic heat. The town of Fort Sill had another son on the way and That Guy was nervous. Mind you his wife, Ima Scainkass-Hillenburg, was doing fine... physically that is.  That Guy wasnât concerned about that for now. His wife, however, had been feeling strange for the past 3 months of her pregnancy. ""Satanâs inside me!"" and ""Iâm a goddamn nightmare bitch!!"" and still ""Iâm the butt-fucking sponge that's here for your soul - Fist me! - Fist me now you sonofabitch!"" were common exclamations heard from her in the middle of the night while she slept.  It wasn't long until her swollen belly brought forth a frothy and eager-cheeked baby boy. Spewing him from her loins onto the sun-warmed wooden kitchen floor, she sighed and dabbed a napkin at the meeting of her thighs. ""It is finished"", she groaned, and collapsed with a sick thud. Upon hearing the tell-tale plop that herald the birth of his son, That Guy bolted in from the thirsty fields and squinted down at the mass of blood and flesh that was his... son? Shrugging, he mumbled something along the lines of ""probably queer"" and demanded sustenance from his recently unburdened wife.   Growing up, young Hillenburg fell under the accusatory stare of his ill-tempered and oft abusive father - a father whoâs only words to his soon were ""queer"" and ""I should have made her swallow"". Hillenburg's mother would only lay one arthritic index finger over another whenever he was foolish enough to come into her presence. She wanted nothing to do with the ""demon boy"". His only consolation during these troubling years were the solitary hours he spent scrubbing at the deep maroon stain his blue-white babe body (and subsequent fetus) had left on the kitchen floor. It was a stain that would never come out. Yet, at his father's insistence, he scrubbed away at the only mark he had ever left on the world. Nuzzling the sponge he'd come to love, he often dreamed of the day when he would be free to do as he wished; see the ocean, stay up past midnight, and maybe even get a job as a go-go dancer at Nipsyâs - Fort Sill Oklahoma's only gay night club.   Years passed and time brought Hillenburg an art teacher - Ms. Arva Sedinbaum. "" It was a mistake "", she recounted in a 1999 interview with the Boston Globe. "" How could I have known what would come of those lessons ?""  Young Hillenburg quickly developed a passion for the arts and excelled in his studies at Paul Lester High School. His quirky demeanor and wildly unique style soon drew attention from New York and Los Angles art colleges. Hillenburg was a hot item - particularly with his character ""Rocko""- A hard-luck everyman wallaby. It seemed that his dreams of freedom were finally coming true.  Soon after college, Hillenburg's character Rocko was greenlighted for itâs own series -  Rocko's Modern Life . It was here that Hillenburg would truly shine. It was also here that the first of many downward spirals began.   Fame proved to be too much for Hillenburg and during the 3rd season of Rocko's Modern Life, he began experimenting with drugs. Whores and coke binges were the dominating factors in his life and with good reason - Hedonism suited him. ""I've got more cooch than an abortion clinic"", as he was often quoted saying proved to be true. But it was not to last.  A fateful evening in Chicagoâs Coco-Bongo brought Hillenburg and LSD together for the first time. It was on this same night that he met the first of many of his secret lovers - Patrick Lindt. "" I thought he was weird but I mean... we all were - I mean... [snort] that's just how things were. But the sponge? That fucked with me "" Lindt bleated in a 2001 interview with the New York Times. Hillenburg has carried his childhood friend on all of his life's adventures. It was his totem - a super absorbent guru. And it was this very sponge that gave birth to his faggity future.  So strange, so unique, so... disgustingly annoying and just downright fucked up... uh... I mean spongy (read: catcher). SpongeBob was born during Hillenburg's two and a half year LSD/Special-K binge. And just who is this SpongeBob?  [ahem]  Deep down in the Pacific Ocean in the subterranean city of Bikini Bottom (read: homosexual paradise) lives a square yellow sea sponge named SpongeBob SquarePants. SpongeBob lives in a pineapple (read: phallus) with his pet snail (ditto), Gary, loves his job as a fry cook at the Krusty Krab (read: vagina is evil), and has a knack for getting into all kinds of trouble without really trying (read: caught giving bj's at truck stops). When he's not getting on the nerves of his cranky next door neighbor Squidward - (who himself is a homoerotica goldmine), SpongeBob can usually be found smack in the middle (read: three-way) of all sorts of strange situations (read: S&M/bondage fantasies) with his best buddy (read: lover), the simple yet lovable starfish (a creature composed entirely of phalluses) , Patrick, or his thrill-seeking surfer-girl squirrel pal (token gal pal who is 'totally not a lesbian'), Sandy Cheeks (read: carpet muncher). Stephen Hillenburg finally gave in to the whims of his psychotropic inductions and breathed life into this... fuckwad sponge. (remember - this is the same guy that brought us the totally un-faggy  urlLink Rockoâs Modern Life      Crime   This is the ex-biologist who created the ""legend"" (read: ubiquitous nightmare). SpongeBob started out as a sketch of a square sponge. Now SpongeBob is a cultural icon (read: flaming homosexual), and so is his creator (ditto). This is the bitch that ruined Nickelodeon (with the exception of  Nick at Night  - God Bless you, Family Ties reruns).  Clearly, he is the devil.  ...I said clearly, bitch!

378480,1510754,2004-07-01,"Well, I just got an email from the advocates of fair and equal time in political advertising saying that my previous piece ""10 reasons why Nazis are better than Republicans"" must be accompanied by a similar piece detailing the faults of the Democratic party so that the voters can have an informed ::cough, cough:: basis on making important ::cough, cough:: voting decisions.  So now, I present the companion article, all about why Democrats blow.    1) They hate successful people.  If you got rich in this country, you did so by exploiting the poor, women, and minorities.  They further spread their hatred by insisting that they be taxed much more highly from their patently ill-gotten gains to compensate for their evil oppression of all people.  2) They love taxes.  If they could tax you on the number of times you have sex per week, they would.  If they were fucking you in the asshole, they'd insist on paying an extra fee for giving you a reach-around.  They also love to spend the taxes they take from you.  If they can find a way to spend taxpayer dollars on useless programs, they spend it.    3) They talk all about how they're the party that cares about women, minorities, labor, and the poor.  Yet, when you see the roster of states that carry the most Democratic support, they're the states that are filled with the most rich white folks.  When you see a Democrat on the floor of Congress, or in the Presidency, the chances are almost inifinitely in favor of him being a rich white guy.  Even when you see them on political stops shaking hands and kissing babies, the hands and babies are almost universally white.  And usually men.  And probably rich.  4) They call themselves the party who loves the environment, and supports foreign aid for the development of the third world.  But tell them to stop drinking the Starbucks lattes, driving the gas guzzling Hummers from home to the corner grocery, wearing the sweatshop Nikes while playing tennis, and eating condor egg omelettes with spotted owl sausage, and they get all indignant.  5) They're in favor of personal freedoms, but watch get them get a big ol' legal hard on when some stoner gets caught with half an ounce of pot and gets sentenced to twenty years in prison.  They think anyone should be given a second chance to reclaim their broken lives if they get into prison, then they mandate that anyone convicted of a felony can't vote, or that getting convicted of a sexual crime means that they're put on a giant registry that can be accessed by anyone at any time, and that their neighbors need to be informed every second they take a step outside their front door.  6) They call themselves the ""liberal"" party, but condemn both socialism and laissez-faire economic policies.  In other words, they're liberals as long as you don't trouble yourself with any definitions of what ""liberal"" actually means.  7) They love having a big federal government, with lots of bureaucracy, which is responsible for most of the legislation and regulation of the government.  Because, you know, no horrifically tyrannical monarchy ever kept itself entrenched by having a massive system of bureaucrats and ministers centralized in one location, and a series of laws and regulations that were arcane and unreadable by anyone except themselves...   8) They're damned dirty evil commie librul hippies.  I know this directly contradicts several of my points above, but it needed to be said.    9) Did I mention taxes?  While I was typing the above 8 points, I had to pay fifty cents in tax to pay for some congressional kid's 10 pack a day Bazooka habit.  Or, more likely, to pay for his next junket to investigate the tourism trade in Barbados.  So, Democrats suck too.  If anyone needs more proof of this fact, remind yourself that the last three Democratic presidents were (1) a lying sleazeball from the South who cheated on his wife, abused the authority of his office, and that's before he even got into the White House, (2) a good ol' Southern boy who mired the country in its worst war ever, using an excuse flimsier than Victoria's Secret lingerie, and (3) a hopeless idealist who probably wouldn't have been able to even cut it as the president of a peanut farm.  And if you need more evidence: George McGovern.  Walter Mondale.  Michael Dukakis.  The defense rests.  The King, out!",male,24,Internet,Aries,0
378481,1510754,2004-07-01,"There.  Now that Godwin's Law has been invoked, we can get down to the serious business of: WHY REPUBLICANS SUCK!  Because they do.  I have met individual Republicans that are pretty nice people, but as a group, y'all suck.    Now, before all you rabid partisan watchdogs get ready to tear my larynx out for being an EVIL GODLESS COMMIE LIBRUL, bear in mind that I bear no party affiliation.  My voter registration card reads that I am a member of the ""Unaffiliated"" party.  A party which, as far as I know, holds no meetings, runs no candidates for office, and doesn't have a statement of purpose beyond apathy.  I do not hate Republicans because I am a Democrat, or a liberal, or any other group that might possibly bear resentment towards the GOP.  I hate them because they suck.    Let's run down some of the reasons:  1) They hate everyone that isn't a white, rich, Protestant, straight male.  Now, some of you are already champing at the bit, upon reading that last sentence, to respond with a comment like, ""But I'm a woman and I'm a Republican"", or ""I'm black and I'm a Republican"".  If you are anything but a white, rich, Protestant, straight male, you're deluding yourself if you identify with the Republican party or platform.  I say this secure in the knowledge that the governor of my state, a woman, and the US Secretary of State, a black man, are successful and fairly respected members within the Republican party.  They may look, on the outside, to be something other than the average Republican, but on the inside beats the heart of a white, rich, Protestant, straight male.    If you don't fit one of the five categories above, the Republican party hates you.  They hate poor people, blacks, Hispanics, Asians, Jews, Catholics, Muslims, women, and gay people.  God help you if you're a poor, Jewish, black, lesbian.  2) They think that God should be everywhere in government.  God has no place in government, and despite what you may think about ambiguous statements like ""endowed by their Creator"" in our founding documents, the Founding Fathers thought so as well.  The Ten Commandments are not the precepts by which we establish our laws and determine our moral guidance, nor is teaching divine creation the sole legitimate means of educating children about the universe, nor is God Bless America anything but a song written for the propagandistic war films of the World War II era.    3) They think that sex and sexual discussion should be kept as quiet as possible, and preferably to not even happen.  They deny the overwhelming evidence that (1) sex is a NECESSARY biological function that each member of the species is driven to perform at least once, and hopefully as often as possible, and that (2) EVERYONE FUCKS.  They believe that abstinence is the only policy worth a fuck (pardon the pun), that sex should only be between a man and a woman who love each other, and only in the bonds of holy matrimony, and that no one should know that anyone ever used their genitals for any other purpose than peeing.  Likewise, they are in favor of free speech as long as it's not about sex, doesn't use dirty words, and doesn't contain any offensive thoughts or ideas (read: anything they disagree with).    4) They believe in the sanctity of life, that fetuses should be allowed to be born and have the chance at life, and that all people who are sick and infirm should allow nature to take its course, saying that abortion and euthanasia are actions that ""mess up God's plan"".  They also see nothing wrong with messing up God's plan by taking the lives of criminals via the death penalty.    5) They ignore that this country was founded on the backs of cheap immigrant labor and people escaping shitty economic and political situations in denying the rights of Africans, Mexicans, Chinese, Vietnamese, Cubans and Haitians the right to do the same.    6) They think Canada and Australia aren't really real countries, that the rest of Europe should listen to us because we bailed their asses out in World War II, and that since we're the most powerful country in the world, everyone should do what we say.  They also believe that in this post-colonial political environment that the Monroe Doctrine (and the Roosevelt Corollary) have any real meaning anymore.  7) They think that all Muslims act and think the same, that Islam is a religion of hate and violence, and that the reason Muslim terrorists hate us is because of our freedom and prosperity.  They also thought the same things about Communists and Nazis.  8) They actually believe that the ""us vs. them"" and ""if you're not for us, you're against us...if you're not a part of the solution you're a part of the problem"" mentalities are anything other than false dichotomies.  9) Did I mention that they hate gay people?  It's apparently important enough for me to mention it twice in this list, since they feel it's important enough to write a fuckin' constitutional amendment about.  10) They actually think that Fox News is fair and balanced, that CNN and MSNBC are part of the ""liberal media conspiracy"", and that Rush Limbaugh is anything other than a big fat idiot addicted to painkillers.  11) Newt Gingrich.  Enough said.  So, that's enough reasons, I feel, why Republicans suck.  They would suck and blow at the same time, twere it possible. But they're not the only ones...",male,24,Internet,Aries,0

He's a heterosexual middle class white american male... which means he's just  got  to be evil. And so far, he was my target when I needed one...   ..until I read  urlLink this masterpiece .   After I cleaned up my vomit and stopped myself from bashing my face into the bathtub, I read it again. I couldn't let this one slide. I had to say  something .   In case you're too lazy [read: American] to read it for yourself, I'll sum it up - he's bitching about being a theme park employee and what assholes the patrons can be.    Ummm... what?! theme park guests are assholes?!... OH MY GOD!!   ...is anyone else  surprised ?   I didn't think so.   Theme parks are  specifically designed to attract assholes .   DUH!   Look at the rides! Look at the shitty food! Look at the commercials filled with assholes beckoning you to the gates of Whatever Bumblefuckery Paradise Park! Jesus.   My friends and I as kids went to the park for the near exclusive purpose of assholery. Buy a clue, friend. If you hate assholes, don't work a job where you are fucking  guanrateed  to meet them... unless you're a full-on masochist... in which case I'll hire you....   [fetish]   I digress... [surprise]   Let's see what brilliant observations the phoenix had to make here... [ his words in   red ]     Humanity comes to its worst when they enter a theme park.    Well there you go right there! He's hip to the jive! Let's see what else he has to say...    No matter who you think you are, 99% of the population is one of these when they go to a park:     an asshole   a complete moron   Umm... well yeah - you basically just said that. But thanks for the cool ""team research"" statistic. By the way, given your 99%, you've included vitually all theme park employees... just so you know, cowboy.   [thumbs up]    moving on...    Manners: Food Consumption      huh? - ok... we'll give this a chance...            Ok folks, weâre not fucking kidding, you are complete slobs. Every theme park Iâve ever been to the guests (a.k.a. all of you) are complete fucking slobs.     Exactly where does the surprise come in? You take several thousand Americans, jam them into an entertainment complex, provide them with thousands of pounds of junk food and disposible plates and cutlery... and you expect them to be neat and tidy?   [pointing and laughing]      If this were Canada, you might have a point, bucko. But it's not, lil' guy. It's America. See? [pointing around] ah-MAAARE-reh-cah.   Very good!   oh and beside all that...    That's what YOU  bitches  are hired for ... to clean up after our lazy asses. Quit your bitchin' - We're keeping you employeed.      Manners: Smoking      There's no way this can be good...           Let me preface this with this comment. I have nothing personal against smokers. If you want to kill yourselves, be my guest.     Thank you I'm glad we have your permission - and on behalf of all smokers, we'll continue to let you stuff yourself full of all kinds of American bullshit food that, believe it or not, will kill you  faster  than our smoking will kill us. More cheesey butterbacon anyone? :)      Let's let him finish...         However, I do not appreciate waiting in a line while your jerkass lights up and infects the rest of the line with your death. Show some respect to your fellow man, and donât light up in line. Youâll get someone talking to you real soon with the power to throw you out of the park if you do light up.     Fair enough. Though we aren't infecting you with anything. Sure it's annoying and it smells but it won't kill you. And, by the way, aboslutly no one is afraid of theme park employees no matter how much ""power"" you have. It's a theme park. Your threats are made of cotton candy and children's laughter. And why are you waiting in a line in the first place? You fuckin' work there, champ!        The asphalt is not an ashtray folks. Stop tossing your cigarette butts all over the place. Thereâs easily a trash can every 30 feet or so. Use themâ¦ or pay the price.      The asphalt IS the ashtray. Period. That's why it's covered in cigarettes. Oh... and we've already paid the 60 million samolians or whatever it is to get into your goddamn special funfuckery farm. Back off. You want us to use ashtrays? Well we want  you  to hire friendly, minimally intelilgent, responsible staff. Let's see if either wish comes true.   The rest of this half-baked nonsense rant goes on to address such firery topics as ""The Dress Code"" and running on the blacktop [oh sweet fucking Jesus no!] and something about sodomy.    What's my point?   Glad you asked.    Nobody gives a shit.    [Full-on balls out laughing]   No one cares.  You work at a goddamn amusement park . What did you expect? I mean, c'mon - Strippers don't complain about getting oggled and occasionally felt up. You have nothing to bitch about - you're in a job that guarantees that you'll run across all the assholes of the world from rich fellas to ditch dwellers. Suck it up, chuckles. You're working at one of the happiest places on Earth - be happy.   (and you're twice the schmuck if you just made a mental note to remind me that the ""Happiest place on Earth"" title belongs to Dishney and not Six Fags)   You're in customer service no matter how you want to look at it. Which means, of course, that  every one of these idiot patrons is your 'daddy' . That's right. Smile and get me a soda, bitch. You're there to make them happy. Learn to deal or quit and get another job. The folk who visit your park will never change.   It's really that simple.        Love and virtual sodomy,     Dexter Otis Green",male,24,Internet,Aries,0
378483,1510754,2004-07-01,"Hello everyone out there in Beer N Porn land!    It has been a while since either I or my esteemed colleagues have posted anything, and there have been a few things on my mind as of late.    So strap yourselves in and get ready for another âkick your assâ roller coaster ride!             â¦                     Speaking of whichâ¦             The topic I choose to speak to the masses about today goes to two sad facets of humanity:    Stupidity & Manners.    And I am going to use a theme park as a reference here, because it is most certainly a nexus of moronic behavior.             Ok, letâs start right off the bat.    Humanity comes to its worst when they enter a theme park.    No matter who you think you are, 99% of the population is  one of these when they go to a park:        an asshole      a complete moron        I donât know what it is about this location that causes the brain drain that occurs.    Letâs take a look at it from a few angles.                      Manners: Food Consumption              Ok folks, weâre not fucking kidding, you are complete slobs.    Every theme park Iâve ever been to the guests (a.k.a. all of you) are complete fucking slobs. Now I know that you are tired from walking around the park all day, and of course, the rides (another story altogether which I am getting to) completely took the wind out of you, so I understand how hard it is for all of you to lift a tray with about 1 lb of trash on it and simply put it in a trash can.    ARE YOU FUCKING SERIOUS!?    Good Christ!    And it doesnât end there, my dimwitted park goers, no!    If you happen to buy a soda or something at a stand, once itâs finished do you just carry it until you find the nearest trashcan, which most good parks put one ever 30 or so feet?    NO! Of course not, you throw it on the ground, and make the whole place look like a shit hole.     Smokers, you get a whole section devoted to you, but just let me say that the ground is not an ashtray; throw your cigarette butts away.    All in all folks, I hate to break it to you, but when you go to a theme park, you are disgusting.              Manners:    Smoking              Let me preface this with this comment.    I have nothing personal against smokers.    If you want to kill yourselves, be my guest.             However, I do not appreciate waiting in a line while your jerkass lights up and infects the rest of the line with your death.    Show some respect to your fellow man, and donât light up in line.    Youâll get someone talking to you real soon with the power to throw you out of the park if you do light up.             The asphalt is not an ashtray folks.    Stop tossing your cigarette butts all over the place.    Thereâs easily a trash can every 30 feet or so.    Use themâ¦ or pay the price.                Manners: Rules of the Park              This one is pretty basic.    What I am referring to here is adhering to the general rules of the park.    Now this part is going to be manners specific, and thereâs only one thing I can think of when I think of this:    The dress code.    Who would have thought, that a PRIVATE company where it is a FAMILY environment (as most/all theme parks are) would have a dress code?    Wow.    Thatâs new, isnât it?              â¦Right?             Câmon people, this oneâs really fucking basic.    Donât go to a theme park and be shocked when one of the workers asks you to put your shirt on,    no one wants to see a pimply, fat old man walking through the park with his shirt off, manboobs swaying for all to see.    On the reverse, ladies, donât be surprised if you go to a water park and you are told that your thong is inappropriate for the environment.    While it may be aesthetically pleasing (and sadly most of these women who do wear thongs have no business wearing such) it is not conducive to a family environment.                 Guys, you know the ones Iâm talking about, the ones who think a theme park is a place to show off their muscles, get a grip, put your fucking shirt on.    Also, if you go to a theme park specifically to meet a partnerâ¦ I fear for reality as we know it.    Also, please try to leave your âFuck the [insert dominating figure (the man, the system, etc) here]"" shirt at home.    If you want to wear shitty/sluttish clothing, thatâs what high school/college is for. Simple enough, follow the fucking dress code, itâs there for a reason.              Stupidity: Rules of the Park              Ok, more stupidity!    Why are you running on asphalt and get offended when someone asks you to walk?    Would you like to trip over a crack in the ground and bust your stupid ass on the ground, crying like a girl with a skinned knee? No and neither does anyone else.    Stop running.             Why are you walking around on hot blacktop without shoes?    Morons! Put your shoes on!             Have I driven this into you enough?      RULES ARE THERE FOR A DAMN GOOD REASON.    FOLLOW THEM OR DONâT BITCH WHEN SOMETHING HAPPENS TO YOU AS A RESULT OF YOUR STUPID ASS.                        Manners/Stupidity: Rider Responsibilities              Ok, if I tried to separate responsibilities into two topics, Iâd have to kill myself out of frustration.             All right, so the reason you come to a park in the first place, the rides. Who the hell goes specifically for anything else other than the rides? I digress.             All right, letâs talk about you.    No, not you.    YOUâ¦    You who develops an invincibility complex upon entering a park.    You who will argue with someone who is obviously trained on these rides and looking out for your own safety when they tell you that you cannot go on a ride.    You who would attempt to remove restraint devices while a ride is moving.    You who causes the rest of the guests in the park a lot of heartache when your dumbass does something stupid and causes a roller coaster to get stuck on the lift hill 180 feet above the earth.             Ok, that is enough setup.    The sheer stupidity and lack of manners on these rides boggles my mind.    Itâs like they feel that they can do whatever they want and fuck the rules! Rules are made to be broken!    Thatâs the American way!    Wrong, dumbass.             Anyone ever been in this scenario, or seen this scenario?    The operator (the person whoâs running the ride) tells you flat out at least 3 times that they are going to unlock your restraints and not to panic.    The restraints open, and all of a sudden the entire train of a roller coaster is stricken with panic with shouts of âHey my restraintâs open!â    Actually, I shouldnât give you enough credit by being able to string those words together. It is actually something more like this:             âUhâ¦. *Hand raised*â             âHEY YO MY LAPBARâS UP!â             âAXCUSE ME! AXCUSE ME!â (No, Iâm not lying; there is no âEâ in these comments)             And then my personal favorite:    people running off the ride because their lap bars opened up when the operator SPECIFICALLY told you that they were going to be unlocked.             *Rage*             Ok, you people have got to get a fucking grip.     When someone tells you that the restraints are opening, FUCKING LISTEN TO THEM!    These people have a Public Address system for a reason, moron.    Letâs talk more about that PA system.    You know whenever someone is talking to me over a PA system I usually just continue doing what I do best: hold my junk and drooling on the ground.    Jesus Christ people, the 4 or 6 or however many people that are strapping you into the ride probably (read: definitely beyond a shadow of a doubt) know more about the ride and they way it is run than you do.    So if they ask you to do something:           It is not an attack on you or your personal intellect.    Thatâs my job.       Do what they tell you to do.                   Ok, round 2, you ignorant ignoramuses.    Let me put it to you this way: Every ride I have ever been on in all the parks I have been to (and I have been to plenty) have signs all over the ride that state the rules and rider responsibilities of the ride.    (Gasp!    I have responsibilities on the ride!    Pshaw!)    Yes folks, sorry to break it to you, but there are rules you have to follow when youâre waiting to get on a ride, or riding on a ride.    Letâs use roller coasters, as they are the focus of most of my hatred for these morons.    (For whatever reason, roller coasters are the nexus point of peopleâs lack of manners and sheer stupidity)    Ok, when youâre waiting to get on the ride, take the time to actually read one of these signs, youâll find them enlightening.    Every single one I have ever seen will tell you the following things:    How tall you have to be to get on the ride, that you need shirts, shorts, and shoes on the ride (some rides you will take your shoes off, but you still must show up wearing them, donât argue with the attendants and operators about it, you need shoes in the park, you need to come to the ride with shoes.),    that no smoking is allowed in the line, that no loose articles are allowed on the ride, that line jumpers will the removed from the park, and that riders must be in good physical condition in order to ride (Which means donât come to the ride drunk off your ass or in shitty physical shape.    These rides kick your ass.).    Now, why are you arguing with the attendants and operators when they are following the rules that are set not only by the park, but by the company that created said ride?    If they tell you that something is a loose article, donât waste everyone elseâs time by arguing that youâve brought it on the ride before and that it should be just fine.    On that note, if you had bothered to READ THE FUCKING SIGN than you would have known to either put those articles in the loose article boxes or give them to a non rider.    Donât argue with the attendants about the height, either. Donât say youâre going to accept responsibility for your kid if anything happens.     The heights qualifiers are there for a reason, and I canât believe that parents would put their childrenâs safety in danger by putting them on a ride they arenât tall enough to go on.    Fucking tools.                     In the simplest language I can muster:             Act like adults.     Treat others the way you want to be treated.     Clean up after yourselves.     Follow the rules.     Donât be stupid.                     Till I bless the world again with my life giving presenceâ¦     ~ The   Phoenix",male,24,Internet,Aries,0
378484,1510754,2004-07-01,"Hello, everyone out there in Beer N Porn land!  It has been.... yeah a long time.  I haven't posted since my spewage that was the New Year's Edition.  Ok, do lots of things have happened between then, and I won't bore you with a run down now.  Maybe later.  Maybe...   Ok.  So here's my return to the universe of BnP.   WARNING!!!!!   I wrote this in March.  That's right, March.  But I read it again, still figured it was good, so I'm putting it out for your torment.  More up-to-date schtick will be coming soon! ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Title: Surprise! College isn't what you think it is!   Ok, so Iâm here sitting in my OPIM (Operational Information Management) course typing this.  Thatâs right, I said Iâm in class.  For the previous 45 minutes Iâve been surfing the web, going to Yahoo to play the Crossword, talking to people online with AIM, and I have to wonder why in fact I am here.  And I donât mean in this classroom on a chilly yet sunny day in Storrs.  I mean why the hell am I in college if academics are not doing it for me.  Iâve been here at the Good âOl U of C for 4 yearsâ¦  Thatâs a long time.  I have taken classes that are to âexpandâ my mind and the way I think.  Thatâs a bunch of bullshit.  I can barely remember what I learned last semester let alone what I learned my freshman year.  So why go to college?  Whatâs the point?  People are the reason.  Case in point: I am a shy guy. (Anyone who sends me a message about Super Mario Bros 2 is getting a sample of my new product, Shut the F up Soda.  â¦ And I also just proved how much of a geek I am, whatever.) At least I was when I was 17 and new meat in the grinder that is UConn.  And now, 4 years later, I am still that shy guy. Heâs hidden out there somewhere.  He comes out for parties and things like that.  I met 250 people on my first day of college.  250 people that I know who would otherwise be nonexistent to me and never would have had the chance to change my life forever.  Iâm a band geek because of it, but wow, was it the gateway to forever change who I was.  I donât care about classes, classes mean nothing.  Itâs a bunch of buzz worded bullshit thatâs crammed down your throat so when I go to get a job I can say, âOoh, look at my shiny business degree!â  Fuck.  I hope I never get to be that much of an asshole that I sit back in a comfy chair and talk about buzzwords in the intricate dance that is a job interview.  Tango well enough, you get the job.  Miss a step and you die.  I canât wait to be done with this farce.  Time to bounce, class is over and so must I be.  Iâll be back to finish this.  Ok, so now Iâm at work.  Standing-by in case anything goes to hell on the job.  And Iâm still in Storrs, and itâs Friday.  Where was I? So much as happened in 2 days.  Oh yeah, why college is necessary. People are the reason why one goes to college.  90% of the people I have known have been from college.  Thatâs a large ass percentage of my friends.  Now I love my high school friends with everything, so itâs not that the 10% of my friends who are from home are worth any less, the fact that one would consider worth in friendship is kind of odd in my own opinion.  My friends are the ones who have kept me going when Iâm down, when Iâm REALLY down, and are ones that share in my glowing accomplishments.  Ten years down the line I am not going to care what I learned in college, what I am going to care about are those people who helped to shape my life in the years that I was the most malleable.  Now, to play Devilâs Advocate, I am not saying that college is just a social zone where you are expected to learn nothing and just meet people.  If you wanted that, just go to a frat party, there will be tons of good people worth meeting there.  (Maybe sarcasm, perhaps not. I will be considered indifferent on this issue.  I donât really think that frats and sororities are what cause people to act like jerks, bitches, or assholes.  People are the way they are.  It does however seem that traits are magnified sometimes when you join one of those organizations.  I speak from the inside looking out folks.)  Classes do serve a good purpose, to teach you HOW to learn, not what to learn.  Iâm taking a course in Dante right now, and I wouldnât have a damn clue where I would start with the reading of that thing, itâs complex shit. Iâm glad I have a teacher that has somewhat of a clue how to steer my understanding of the piece.  Other classes I have taken, like my OPIM 204 class, is a complete waste of my time. Itâs a classroom regurgiatation of what I have been learning on the job for the past 5 years.  In a year, I graduate from UConn.  What will I remember?  Will I remember that one course that changed my life? No.  Am I going to care about what I took my fifth semester? No. I can barely remember what I took my fifth semester now!  What I can and will remember is the people that helped change my life. Iâm never going to forget the name of the person who got my into the UCMB; Iâll never forget who gave me entry into an organization that did in fact change who I was and magnified my good ideals; and Iâm not going to forget that the road to my happiness was paved by going to the mailbox, and reading the letter that said: âYou are hereby accepted to the University of Connecticut.â  It should have read: âYouâre going to UConn. Be prepared to have your life changed in ways you never would have thought possible.  Imagine that your limits will be tested beyond your wildest imagination.  You are going to meet people in your first days that will still be with you, and will forever be with you through all the ups and downs.  You are going to join organizations.  You will drop out of organizations.  Your loyalties will be concreted. You are going to decide here what you want to do with your life. You are going to try. You are going to fail. You are going to try again.  You will eventually succeed.  You are going to leave this school by graduation or otherwise with a better idea of who you are.â  I have learned about myself.  I have faced my fears, tested my boundaries, and I will never look back.  Burning in flames to be reborn in lightâ¦  Peace.  ~ The Phoenix",male,24,Internet,Aries,0
378485,1510754,2004-05-25,"[5.24.04]  Alrighty. So today was mouse hunting day. I got up extra early and sat around twiddling my thumbs for about 2 hours -  urlLink Best Buy  didn't open until 10. Fine by me - I still needed directions. After keyboard commanding my way through  urlLink mapquest , I got directions and nearly flew out of my apartment at 9:30. The hope was that I'd get distracted enough on the way that I'd end up there at the exact moment they opened.  I tried to kept the directions straight in my head while dodging morning joggers, bleary-eyed students, early morning execs, and pet fanatics - all under a dripping, dingy, rat fur colored sky.  What a way to start my day.  Determined not to let it get me down, I sang a little as I trucked along. About 5 min after I had started my mouse quest, I just happened to look over to my right and what to my wondering eyes did appear?   urlLink Fenway   I stood transfixed for a few moments hardly aware that I was on the verge of mindlessly stumbling into traffic on account of edifice fetish.  Awesome...  [drool]  [Freud 1 - Dexter 0]  Composing myself and resuming my little song, I continued down the puddled-spotted sidewalk toward Best Buy. I ran across a  urlLink BK  and stopped in on principle. Thus far, BK had been good to me - I couldn't very well just walk by without a quick hello [read: dropping a deuce in their quasi-hygenic facilities]. Plus, my lil' tummy was gearing up to protest a fuel shortage soon. Perfect timing once again, BK. I nabbed a sandwich, skipped the deuce for the moment, and got back on track to Best Buy.  Thank God I'm a child of the 80's. My extensive Frogger experience helped me cross two busy streets of drivers who wanted nothing more than to turn me into black top carrion.   [ mad dash! ]  And there it was... Best Buy... ...  closed...   [crap!]  I sat outside of Best Buy on a concrete wall for 20 minutes while workers inside milled around. Thankfully I was not alone. An old west indian woman and a fella full of  urlLink lattes  were with me. Joy. The woman kept peering inside and gesturing at the employees. I think all she really wanted was a hug.   whatever.  Best Buy open and I strode in with purpose, baby. I found the mice, nearly decked a Best Buy rep. when the mouse on display [10 bucks] was out of stock, nabbed a 19.99'er and headed for the door.  Bastards.  So be it. I have my mouse.  [schweet]  Back down the soiled sidewalks, over the trecherous roads, quick stopping for some groceries, over a bridge, and a pack of smokes later, I was back in the apartment huffing and sweating fondling my newly acquired hardware.  Goodbye Keyboard Commando. Hello wicked slow porn surfing!  [note: notice my quick shift into  urlLink Bostonian ? I'm becoming one of them!]  I sat there for a good chunk of the rest of my day relishing the mouse-tasticness of it all.  Then boredom struck.  Hard.  Thankfully a call came in summoning me to Forest Hills. Braving the sketchy late night train crowd [ including a woman who proceeded to demand quarters from EVERYONE waiting for the outbound train - her mom aparently had colon cancer (insert sympathy here) ] I hopped the T over to Sean's place. A jam session, tomato sandwich, and concert planning session later, it was time for some Eastern Meditation Madness and then, thankfully, some uncomfortable sleep.  I was already missing my mouse.",male,24,Internet,Aries,0
378486,1510754,2004-05-25,"[originally post on 5.24.04 @  urlLink BnP ]  Alrighty.  Sunday has come and gone. Letâs recap.  I finished off âThe Girl Who Loved Tom Gordonâ. Not Kingâs best but certainly a winner. Picked up Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and started digesting that parchment truffle. Wandered around Boston for about 4 hours with a friend (Colin â yes he isâ¦ no we didnât â shame on you) who showed me a great many of Bostonâs offerings. After scarfing more BK, I headed back to the apt and tried in vain to porn surf without a mouse. Iâm telling you now itâs damn near impossibleâ¦ damn nearâ¦  [ahem]  After that little adventure, Sean stopped over and we played and sang on my roof for a while. You know, the little things ear making this whole move worth while â singing at the top of my lungs on a foreign roof veiled in cigarette smoke, warm tar underfoot with unlearned strangers undoubtedly mumbling anonymous critiques, laughing at the sky for no damn reason, daring the clouds to rain on that perfect settingâ¦ [sigh]  Magic.  We ambled in shaking with equal parts laughter and cold â Boston had been playing it cool all afternoon and it was time for yours truly to get indoors. Inside? We chatted for a while and then went mouse hunting. [note: I forgot my mouse and have been using nothing but keyboard commands] By then it as close to 9pm and, wouldnât you know, there were no mice to be had.   An ATM beckoned nonetheless and Sean and I decided it would make a perfect studio. We made ourselves right at home amidst the eggshell flood lights and pea-green monitors. I got a very quick guitar lesson before the ATM room was filled with patrons who apparently didnât agree with our studio idea. Undaunted and armed with Seanâs Ibanez, we made grand fools of ourselves traveling the streets of Boston improving blues [Anybody got Drawz foâ Lease?] and generally jarring the drowsy public with Seanâs great guitar and my shameless singing. Somehow we made it across street and past several cock-eyed passersby and settled on my stoop. Chilled but triumphant, we climbed the stairs to my apartment babbling in the language of satisfied men.  Once inside, we chatted the night away â light fare really; God, the universe, and everything. Before too long, the digital clock bade Sean home and, after walking him down, I headed up to be alone in my palace.  It simply does not get better than this.",male,24,Internet,Aries,0
378487,1510754,2004-05-25,"[originally posted 5.23.04 @  urlLink BnP ]  So here I am in Bostonâs Back Bay area just a stoneâs throw away from the from the famed Jillianâs and a drunken quarter-mile stumble from Copley Square. Fenway is within shouting distance, The Boston Conservatory is literally across the street, and the Prudential Building vies for my attention amidst a sea of various apartment building and hostels outside my window.  Beantown, baby. Fâing fabulous.  I guess I should start from the beginning of all of this...  About a week ago I was working at my deluxe-all-time-sweet job at the XxtraMart when I get a phone call. âHowâd you like to live in Boston for the summer and play with my band for free?â, came the phone on the other end. My best friend was ecstatic with the news and I stood there with the receiver to my ear bleating âyesâ like a bored chick getting dry humped by some neâer-do-well in the back seat of a beaten sedan at the drive in.  Money.  This is what I had been waiting for. An unbelievable opportunity had just fallen into my lap and I wasnât about to turn it down. I hung up the phone after making him promise to fill me in on the details when I got back to my apartment and spent the rest of my shift with a $1,000,000 smile and an erection that only a well worn hooker could love. A week later, my crap backed into so many bags and/or flung carelessly into the trunk of my roommates car, I scurried up to Boston sporting the same unbelievable thumper.  I met my buddy outside of the New England Conservatory and we ferried him over to what was to be my apartment. After 30 min of one-way street denials, we finally pulled up to a modest five-story yellow painted brick building. We carried my crap up the 4 flights of stairs to the top floor, piled it onto the couch, and, after a few brief words and some gas money, my ride headed for the hills. Sean suggested I head over to his place to hang out and well by gosh golly gee I did. We hopped the T (train) and I spent the night playing guitar and generally catching up with Sean. Morning came and I rode the T back to my part of town so that I could get my things organized.  Things took a turn.  On the way to the T the night before, we took a roundabout route that led us to some quality dining at Burger King (sweet!). Needless to say, I couldnât just retrace my steps from the night before. But so what! I confidently stepped off of the train saddled with my trombone and a newly acquired GUI-tar and started hoofing in the general direction of my apartment.  After about 10-15 min, I found the street I live on but, wouldnât you know it, that fucker was long! I knew I was close to my apartment but I didnât know whether it was to the left or to the right. Whatever. I was in a dandy mood and took my chances heading left. 6 blocks of unfamiliar territory changed my mind and, making a quick pivot, I headed in the opposite direction. That way lead to the same âI donât knowâsâ and I found myself lost. What a fucking tourist. Luckily, I spied a pair of Bostonâs finest, and, after some debate, shambled over to them burdened with the instruments.  And thatâs when it happened.  âHey guys, Iâm lostâ, is all I said. The response? âYou lookinâ for the Boston Symphony?â said the lady cop... in Boston-ese. I was thrilled! My very first Boston accent! I stood there trying not to smile like a child-molester and hung on their every word. She and her likewise linguistically gifted chum pointed me in the right direction and finally, heaving and panting, I found my apartment.   Over the next few days, I was like a priest at an all-boys camp for the mute. I even got in touch with another friend of mine and had a couple beers in a sketchy ass Latino ghetto (in which I got lost).  Today? â I had French Toast and Meat (swear to godâ¦ thatâs how itâs listed on the menu), finally got my computer up and running, finished a novel, smoked my weight in cigarettes, and rocked out hard on some guitar. I was in such a good mood, the gunshots in the alley outside my window hardly phased me!  Iâm here for at least this summer but, hell, if things go well I wouldnât be opposed to living in this town. So what if I have to spend part of my day dodging homeless panhandlers and partially-toothed Mexican psychopaths (true story). Iâm in Fâinâ Beantown, baby!",male,24,Internet,Aries,0

How frigginâ sweet it that eh?   And my day, you ask? How was it? Wellâ¦  Today started off pretty slowly. I hung around the apartment in my underwear chatting with folk online and stuffing my face with beefaroni and cigarettes. Not exactly noteworthy experiences, I know. But I also had made plans to see Brother Blue. If you donât know who he is, do a search on google and read all you can. The man is impressive.  Anyway, 6:45 comes along and, after a fairly boring day, I hopped the train to get to Harvard Square â Orange Line to Downtown Crossingâ¦ Downtown Crossing to Red Lineâ¦ Red Line to Alewifesâ¦ Hop off Alewifes at Harvard. Easy, right? âCeptinâ this olâ fool rode the T to the end of the line and ended up 4 stops away from Harvardâ¦ oh and I didnât have enough to get to Harvard let alone get back home.  Luckily I had my guitar.  Sitting down at a bustop, I broke out the axe and began to play. I had called Sean and he had pretty much told me âGet here! â Play for train fare. So I didâ¦ and didnât get a dime. After a few phone disputes, I went over to the lady in the both at the turnstiles for the T and told her my story. Wrong stopâ¦ out of cashâ¦ what do I do? She let me back on the train for free.  Awesome.  Thank you âT Ladyâ.  Hoping back on the train and getting off at Harvard, I felt much safer. I was un-trapped and un-lost. I exited the station and ran smack dab into a small clan of misfits jamming out on the sidewalk â headed by Sean of course. We saddled up after a brief celebration and off we wentâ¦  â¦but to where?  In typical Sean fashion, he knew not where we were goingâ¦ only that we had to get there. And, sure enough, after about 5 min, we were lostâ¦ again.  [crap!]  We spent most of Brother Blueâs performance traveling around Harvard Square trying to find our way. When we finally found Blue, it was all but over. We caught the last few minutes and I prepared to head home slightly unfulfilled. But all was not lost.  Blue noticed us [namely Seanâ¦ as they knew each other] and invited us back to his wifeâs office to âjam outâ. He talked about a million miles an hour shifting from one topic to another flawlessly. The man was inspiring.  After a brief improv session, we went to his office and watched the man do a 10 min improv version of King Lear. It was amazing.  Justâ¦ amazing.  The man is talented. We talked a fair amount with Blue and I have to say I dug the man. But time grew short and soon we were on our way. After a brief stop at a Pizzeria Unoâs [and some hijinx/storytelling there], we hopped the Night Owl and headed back to my apt to chat and otherwise instigate buffoonery.  Such was my day.  Slow? Sure, but Brother Blue made it all worth while. You really have to meet the man.   Tomorrow night, I head to the Cape. With any luck, I will have handed down the Turtles crown and will return for more madness. Until then, I bid you all a brief adieu.",male,24,Internet,Aries,0
378489,1510754,2004-05-30,"I should have let them exterminate.  Right before I left for the cape, a letter was slipped under my door informing me that my apartment was scheduled for âFree mandatory treatment - extermination in other words. Along with that, they requested that I move and clean and empty a bunch of this and thats to make their job easier.  F That.  I was Cape Cod bound. I didnât have time for such triffles.  When I got back, I shopped. Oh, did I shop. Whatâs more, Iâd found a Shawâs Card in the apartment which meant EVEN MORE SAVING! HUZZAH! [tear] - I even got two huge bags of Lays... a splurgance you say? HA! Buy one get one FREE.  And then the rats came.  I left a half loaf of bread and chips [both sealed - how useless] on the couch. This morning when I got up to feast on my potato bounty, I noticed that there were new openings - several new openings.  The Rats ate my free chips.  DAMN THEM!  I have rats!  CRAP!  No more using the couch as a lazy manâs pantry.  Anyway, off to my second gig of the summer I went - this time with the Wooster Brass Band. 3 miles of terrible marching and mediocre music later, I was headed back to the city.  I had an amazing meal of lamb and rice at a Lebanese restaurant and then I headed back to my apartment laden with various whatnots for composing music on this damned iMac.  Quiet, Dobbs.  Back in my apartment I was immediatly hit with a beer jones and, remembering the brick oven joint (the name eludes me even now) I headed out once again despite my waning constitution.  I sat down armed with a Bradbury novel and ordered a Pabst... and then another... and then the bill came...  4 dollars.  Magnificant.  Iâll be back :)  Tommorow I have two more gigs in two more unknown cities for unknown masses celebtrating unknown soldiers and heroes. Joy. I may even get to play some snare.

378490,1510754,2004-05-30,"So here I sit at 7:05 AM on a Sunday morning swadled in quilts and goose-flesh. I'm trying to get my head back on straight. I'm trying to figure out what the hell happened in the past few days...  Wednesday  I left for Cape Cod after a fairly uneventful day. The plan was that I take the train into Braintree [try saying that 3 times fast... (take the train into Braintree) it's not all that hard but it's got a catchy rhythm] and Sasquatch and Tom would pick me up on Union St. There was a Sox game (which we won) that night and traffic in the city would be hell. I contested that traffic on the T would be hell as well but, whatever, I knew where to go. I hopped on the Orange Line, hot-footed to the Red Line and sat down on a train with ""Braintree"" glowing on it's forehead.  [cue unplanned calamity]  While I was on the train, the switches that allow trains to move from one track to another malfunctioned. The train had to be temporarily shutdown... with ALL that friggin' Sox traffic.  wow...  MBTA's alternative was to put us all (that's right - ALL) on a few busses and ferry us over to Quincy Center/Braintree that way. We unloaded the T at Quincy [pronounced ""Quinzy""] and piled onto the buses. We were clearly making the most of the space the busses afforded. I was stuck standing next to the driver and God help me if I wasn't using all of my strength not to let the throngs of people send me carrening over the danger-indicating ""yellow line"" and out the windshield.  What a rush.  We finally arrived in Braintree and I was set free from the masses. We had been let off at the bus terminal [and not the train terminal, of course]. My ride didn't know all of this and so it was still up to me to find Union Street. Not a problem. I found a sign with an arrow pointing to Union Street after a brief jaunt/looksee and headed down the road toward what I thought would be the otherside of the station - ""Where the exit for the trains must be"", I thought.  The Dentistâs office made a fool out of me.  That's about how far I got before I started thinking that if I went a little farther, I may never find my way back. Winded but undaunted, I headed back from whence I came. Lo and behold! My ride came growling up the road to meet me.   Rapture.  We were at the Cape in 45 min.   Wednesday @ midnight - Turtles  I can't/won't say much about turtles. I will say that I had ten (10) candidates who were stuck on economics (L8). Very shortly after we began, the scene went foul. Everyone was puking - everyone had their own personal garbage bag that they were faithfully filling with vomit (some went through more than one bag). It smelled worse than a burning leper colony. And the game hadn't been going on for more than and hour. It was a nightmare.  Such is Turtles I guess [shrug].  I was honestly more interested in handing down the Turtles Master title than I was in finishing the game. Austin (Master hopeful) was in a bad way that night and putting him through would not do. So be it. The game ended with 7 out of 10 victorious. I don't rememeber where I finally ended up sleeping.   Thursday - Cape day 2  I awoke and was immediatly aware of a motherbitch hangover. One of the youngins recognized my condition and handed me a bottle of J.W. Red. It did the trick. Bless you, Tom. I learned that shotgunning beer and stumbling about makes the day go by much faster. Fortunatly no one was hurt and, in fact, I got some tasty cake out of the deal. To be honest, though, I could only tell you that it may have been chocolate. I can't confirm that.  I decided that I didn't want to leave as Turtle Master and took Austin away.  We came back.  There's a new Turtle Master. Awesome.  Later that night I was punched in the face. Which was fine because previous to this, the offender had shieled my naked body from crowds of beweildered co-eds as I crossed the hostile territory toward ice and more confusion. Hand to God. Thanks Phil and Tom.  I still am not entirely sure why I was naked.  Apparently I joined a fraternity.  I wasn't even supposed to be there that night.  Sasquatch had arranged a ride so that I could stay an extra night and then proceeded to leave with all my crap in his car.  I haven't shaved in about a week now.  I collapsed in a heap on someone's couchbed mumbling to myself and apparently drooling. I woke up hurting and was brought home in the relative comfort of Austin's car. I hopped the train back home and gladly climbed the 5 flights of stairs to my apt.  I'm gonna have an incredible ass come the end of this summer.  I wasnât at my apartment long. All roads eventually lead to Forest Hills and, you guessed it, an hour later I was on the T to Seanâs place. I had almost forgotten that I had a gig early the next morning.  Meet the newest member of The Boston City Band.  ...oh and the Worchester [pronounced Wuh-stuh] Brass Band.  Who would have thought that I could get so much done in a day.  I met up with my fellow bandmates in a small Christian town outside of Boston. After a short parade (and a rather terrifying Orwellian Speech at the town square) we headed over to the American Legion for some free grub.  Money.  Then it was back to Boston and Star Market [read: Shawâs].  I have food - thank God.  The rest of the day wasn't too exciting. Sean lent me his iMac for the summer seeing as how my computers (thatâs right - plural) have given out on me.  [cue Dobber chanting ""One of us! One of us!""]  I found out that thereâs a sweet little mama of a brick oven pizza place not 100 yards from my stoop... and they have Guinness AND PBR on tap.  Nice.  I climbed the stairs for what must have been the 5th time that day and eventually collapsed into a semi-naked heap on my little twin bed.  So I guess I do have a fair idea of what went down the last few days.   In a few hours, I go to march in some other small Christ-driven town. Right now, though, Iâm gonna have a smoke, a shower, and, God willing,  a breakfast sandwich from BK.  BK - oh how I love thee.",male,24,Internet,Aries,0
378491,1510754,2004-06-01,"Parades - 2... in a row... my poor body...  Iâll start from the beginning...   I got up this morning in a flash - jumping out of bed, mind you. I was convinced that my mom was trying to reach me. Odd dream? - Maybe. Anywho after a terrible shower, I collected my things and headed over to the pick-up point for the Boston City Band. We piled into the car and headed over to Harvard Square for our first parade.  We rocked. Rather we sounded fair. And the parade was decent. Mile or two. And we actually got a smoke break believe it or not.  The parade route crossed a major road and, from time to time, it was shut down to let parts of the parade pass. How awesome is that? While we wrere waiting for it to open, the band chilledout on the sidewalk and I sparked a mean olâ cancermancer and enjoyed the cool shade of a Maple.  This parade was much easier than the previous dayâs parade and it was over quickly. Thank God. Off to the next concert we went.    The second parade [in Medford] was a little longer but so be it. It was cash in my pocket and, to be honest, thatâs why I was there. We lined up, stepped off, and so began a painful sound excursion over the longest 2+ miles of my life.  Yet al was not lost. the Shriners were there and were right in front of us on Honda motorcycles. One of them had a sidecar. They did all kinds of maneuvers and such - it was great.  God I love Shriners.  The parade ended without much of a fuss. There wasnât even a reviewing stand. So be it - I got paid. Huzzah. We headed back to the car with our pockets stuffed with checks and started undressed and packing away our instruments. And then I heard the words...  Free Food...  followed quickly by...   FREE BEER...  What?  Thatâs right! Free food AND free beer for all parade participants and the American Legion. How sweet is that, eh? We hustled over and immediatly began stuffing our faces with homemade goodies and downing cold beer.  We consumed quickly in comfortable silence.  After a min the silence was broken and, loosened by beer, chatting ensued.  And then the afternoon got even better...  The Boston Crusaders came to play.  Jesus loves me - this I know...   They rocked out a personal show for the participants and, before it was all over, we had to take off. Our bodies demanded sleep.  Heading back to the city, we unloaded at the pick-up point and I left the rest of teh gang sipping expressos as I headed back to my apt. Sean showed up about an hour later.   Big Surprise :)  We headed out chatting about life, reason, perception... elementary crap. Soon we found ourselves at Woodyâs (THE brick-oven pizza place mentioned in previous posts) and our conversation continued over pabst, Guinness, and snackery.   The time came for planning the upcoming concert this weekend and we drifted not too unwillingly back to the Apt.  Itâs now 12:07 - Iâm beat to hell but man am I ever satisfied. Today went well. I mean, how do you top free beer? I submit that you cannot!  Sleep beckons, kids, and Iâll soon give in to the temptress.

378492,1510754,2004-06-02,"Da Bands   So far, Iâve been doing a lot of takl about the bands that I play with but, as usual, Iâve sorta quickstepped over the details. Enough of you are already confused. This should help...   Da Bands   The Boston City Band  Letâs see... how do I describe this one? Wel... it IS itâs own band but, the members play in a number of bands. When hired, one does not know which band one will be playing with or who will be in said band. Basically there are a core of people Russ [the head guy] draws from. Out of this group, he forms anywhere from 2 to 7 bands. Then he hires a number of people to balance out the bands and, that accomplished, we are set loose on the parade.  Technically, I play with about 7 marching bands; The Boston City Band, The Worchester Brass Band, The Boston Windjammers... I think you get the point. So be it. Keeps me fed.   Frankpipe  Frankpipe is the reason that Iâm here... more or less. It a band comprised of guitar, bass, drums, an ever-changing horn section, and a wacky frontman vocalist. the music is inspired by the bizarre and unusual as well as traditional whatnots. I think itâs safe to say that the music is unlike anything most people have heard. Itâs Weird Al meets Mr. Bungle meets, Bobby McFerrin meets Rush meets Jimi Hendrix meets Tower of Power meets Wesley Willis.You have to hear it to understand what Iâm getting at. Even then, Iâm not sure if thatâd help much.  In this band, I play the role of trombonist, composer, and whatever else I can lend my talents to. Iâll keep you all posted on gig dates. I think youâll like our sound.  That about does it for the bands. When Iâm not scuttling from one gig to another, Iâmusually sitting here chatting with you all, eating, or [lately] sitting at the bar at Woodyâs drinkinâ my Pabst and reading. Donât be surprised if you canât reach me by phone. Just email me [DexterAML@yahoo.com] or IM me at GuinnessAML.   Now about my day...   I spent the first part of it sitting around in my boxers and T-shirt eating Swiss Cake Rolls [a childhood favorite] and chatting up folk online. Again, nothing too exciting or worth going into great detail over. And again, tonight I had made plans to see Brother Blue.  Around 1:15 I headed out to meet Colin for lunch in harvard Sqaure. I managed to stay unlost and had a mediorcre reuben at the Greehouse Cafe [or something like that]. We walked and talked through Harvard Yard [translation: Hahvahd Yahd] and, dropping him off at the Peabody Museum, I hopped the T bck to my place.  Sean showed up a bit later and I passed out while he did whatnots on the computer. When I got up an hour later, it was time to go and hang with Blue but I was anything but in the mood. I hung back at the apt while he went to experience Blue.   10 min after he left, Pabst beckoned and I found myself at Woddyâs belly up to the bar nose-deep in a Bradbury novel. [Sigh]. The Pabst flowed, the pages turned, and and hour later I was back here at the apt.  And then I noticed the phone.  Sean had left his cell behind. Awesome! - It was past nine and calls were free. I could finally call and talk with people.  Ha.  I talked with Don Mom a while [awesome] and with Don [likewise]. The others were busied with anything up to and including video games. So be it. I had âworkâ to do anyway. My next move was to get in touch with my radio promotions contact [neil, you great big wonderful man you] soâs the show could get some radio advertisements. Money! - he helped us score ads on 6 radio stations.  Iâll talk more about the show in tommorowâs post.  After that, Sean showed and we talked late into the night.

378493,1510754,2004-06-03,"Ok ok  - so what happened today? - Iâm so frigginâ tired but I canât let my body rest just yet...  Got out of bed and damn near immediatlly got back into planning the concert. [Saturday night at 7:30 if you all are interested - details are at the bottom left of the website - Click on the link with Sean Frenette]. That went on for several frustrating hours broken only by the occasional brief roof-top jam/planning session and chess with Ed.  After that, I took a well deserved nap and woke to Sean taking off. 6 hours of planning has a way of draining a man. I needed liquid refreshment.  Off to Woodyâs.  I was greeted by PBR [draft, baby] and plowed through the rest of the Bradbury novel [The Martian Chronicles]. i was almost sad when it was done. The man writes like I dream. Incredible.  After that, it was back to the apartment [up the stairs - I can almost feel my ass getting sexier - and back to my only CT link... the iMac. I chatted up some folk and surfed here and there but remained unsatisfied. I noticed that Colin, my Boston native chum, was online and working late. Turns out he worked about 10 min from my apt.  Adventure time.  I ef the apt at 10pm braving the weirdo crowds. What did I see? A dude feeling up his girlfriendâs ass, two dudes feeling each other up in front of Dickâs Last Resort [hand to god] a panhandler actually WORKING for handouts... well.. at least this one was singing, and not ONE but TWO stretch H2âs... thatâs right. 2.  Anyway I found Colin, got a tour of the masion that he works in [no really - itâs a full-on 1908 masion] and we headed out to check out the manwhores, trannywhores, bums, skanks, fratboys, and other assorted folk that littered the sidewalks and cafes.  We stopped at a Pizzaria Unoâs and paid WAY too much for Newcastle [11.50 for two beers] and, after some great convo, it was back to dodging street trash. I walked him over the T and headed back to my apt.  What was so great about today? Is it because Iâm getting used to the city? Maybe âcause I had more beer than usual? Or Bradbury? I always feel better after finishing a book.  You know... I donât really care. Today was a good day and that is that.  Had I more energy, Iâd post more.

378494,1510754,2004-06-04,"Firstly, my apologies to those of you who were jonesing for a post last night. I was was too beat  down tired to deliver.     June 3, 2004   I woke up and decided today would be a good day to get the hell out of my apartment for a while - maybe a long long while... yeah. So I got dressed, grabbed Bradbury and headed out the door. I wandered like Iâve never wandered before - at least in this city. First stop was Copley Square where a classical duo of oboe and piano were setting up to play [nice]. Then it was down to the Boston Public Gardens - gaudy swan boats and all :). After that it was back up Boylston to Wendyâs... or BK. Unfortunately, for the first time ever, BK lost out [see previous posts. In my Boston, BK is king] to Wendyâs... because Wendyâs had a bathroom - whatever.  Filled and lightened, it was of to... somewhere. I basically went along until I found and interesting place - I checked it out and, if it had seats, I stayed a while and read.  After about 3 hours of this I ended up in the Fenway area [The Fens]. I saw a park bench in the shade and decided it would be a decent spot for Bradbury and I. I crossed a street thick with hectic traffic and had just sat down to read when...  Hey is that a sitar?  Hey... I know that kid - itâs whatâs-his-name!... one of the kidâs from the NEC that Iâd marched with... oh and Frankpipeâs bass player [Josh].  Good times - someone to talk to... and talk we did...  That is... until  she  came...   At first she was barely noticeable... just a small grumbling and mumbling behind us. That soon grew to loud talking and odd accusations to finally she was full on shouting at Josh and I - I caught this line clearly...    Crazy Woman:  âIndian Sitar Picnic of Whores!â   thatâs right - We were an  indian sitar picnic of whores .  Fabulous.  She left about 5 min later pressumably going to spread her message of peace and love elsewhere.  Josh and I talked forever at the Fens and then to an Indian buffet and then next to the NEC dorms. Good times. And it should come as no surprise that Sean walked by. We hung out there - Sean, Josh, and I - for a bit until Sean [and a new newly arrived Sean] were going to practice a piece for the show. I followed like the bored puppy that I was.  After that madness, it was back to my apartment for some me time.  I hate dial-up.  I quickly got tired of frustrating myself [load, damn you, load!]...  ...stop laughing...  and I called Sean to see what the deal was. He was at joshâs - right around the block. Money.  After a quicky packy run, we wenât up to Joshâs apartment and jammed out in Hindustani [sp.]for a few hours. The night was getting on and I walked Sean to the T.  I wandered.  A Fridayâs caught my eye and I stopped in, ordered a Sam, got carded, and immediatly started flirting with the bartender for no reason.  She flirted back.  Fun.  We talked Tolland vs. Boston for a while and then, after she bought me a beer [wink!] it was time to head home.  Iâm hoping tommorow turns out to be a little more interesting.

For the past week or so (maybe longer - who can tell in this, the land of the divine) thereâs something thatâs been nagging at my brain. Something is awry. Everyone seems to be fine but I canât shake the feeling that something is.. I donât know... off? Iâm insane - this is true - but itâs lead to my calling home (twice) and, on several occasions, all but grilling friends about their emotional status.  Something is definitely not quite right.  Or maybe  wasnât  quite right?  Maybe I  am  going insane. Maybe this is a prelude to a lightning spiral dive into paranoid delusional psychosis. Though it could be all that beefaroni that Iâve been pounding down. I can almost hear myself getting fatter.  [joy]  If I donât nail this down soon, Prozak and or Wellbutrin may indeed be in my near future.  Or Hey! It could just be a form of separation anxiety. Right? I mean I am in a big olâ scary city far far away from all that is familiar. It could be that. 99% of my friends are over in CT well outside of âhanging outâ range. Plus I haven't seen my family in a little while. I mean that could be it. I donât donât too well away from my friends for extended periods of time. Iâm no good on my own - just like the song says. I just need to make more friends here. Thatâs the ticket right there. Problem solved.  right - Iâm kidding myself. Something is up.  heh  It could be âyou-know-whoâ.   Every time he gets into some kinda trouble, my Spidey Sense starts to tingle. In fact itâs likely that heâs gotten into some kind of fix by now. I wouldnât be surprised. The timing is just about right. I donât think he got anyone pregnant though. I would have heard about that. He would have been on the phone 3 seconds after he found out about it, pitching the circumstances to me as if the world were ending. Though, amazingly, Iâve heard nothing from him since the Final Shouting Match (and my subsequent pussy boy apology... necessary? sure... but chaps my ass nonetheless) if you can believe that. Absolutely nothing. Some of us live our whole lives without news that good.  And the pissah? [see? every day more and more like ""them""!]? I still miss the bastard. Figure that one out.  Years  of shrieking and death threats and near all out brawls and a broken guitar [grumble] and other assorted lameness later, I still miss the bastard. I mean sure, I donât hate him... I just canât deal with him. But he was a very good friend - my best friend for a while... and I didnât even get the clean break that I wanted, dig? And the biggest fuck of it all? If he dropped the âactâ, heâd be a sweet kid! ugh.   I actually almost wrote him an email...  ...and then I remembered why we arenât talking and I returned to my senses. God help me if I ever return to that circus of confusion. Talking with that kid is as futile as trying to blow yourself. Never have I met anyone so convinced that they are on the brink of extinction... I mean  sure  of it. And Iâd sit there on the phone trying to convince him of the obvious.  âYouâre not a bad guy, youâre just an asshole because you believe that youâre a bad guyâ , went the drone. And, believe it or not, this would start  fights , people. I'm shocked that it never came to blows.   wtf?  How did this even come up?  Mother of Pearl.  Itâs gonna take one hell of a therapist to work that all out. In the meantime, Dr. Whiskey will advise me.  ...  man...  Could be that my sister is pregnant? I mean sheâs a good gal but... I mean do you think she could have...  ???  God I donât even want to think about it.  Sheâs not preggers. End of story.  Could be a tumor... [itâs not a tumor]  Could be a chemical imbalance [I hope itâs not a chemical imbalance]. Could be stress. Could be the waxing moon... [or is it waning?... could be that too]   Whatever.   For the life of me I canât pin this thing down and, christ with crutches, itâs really starting to irk me something awful. I need a vacation... a vacation from my problems.  But Iâm  FINE ... so why in Godâs name am I so... paranoid?! is that even the right word?  I think so.  I know so.  I should start drinking more.  I need to get more sleep.

378496,1510754,2004-06-05,"So Pride Week kicked off today without much hurrah. i woke up to a gorgeous day (welcome after so much rain) and set out to find a place to do laundry. Funny thing about Boston - thereâs really no Laundromat where one can do his/her own laundry. Oh sure there are Laundromats but you have to pay for THEM to do it for you... by the pound. .85 - .95 cents a pound seemed to be the standard rate. I was definitely not excited with the idea that some oddball would be fondling my unmentionables for the next three months. I decided to call Sean to see if I had missed something and I had - there are machine in the (ubdercreepy) basement of my building. Excellent. And I found that the machines are large enough (and my clothing stockpile small enough) that I can do all my laundry in one load.  That done, I tossed on a fresh shirt and headed out to find the opening ceremonies for Pride Week. There was supposed to be a flag raising at city hall around noon. I left at about 12:30 so I wasnât expecting to see that - I only wanted to see the flag and get out of the apt to maybe meet a few folk. I ended up giving up after about 45 min. or so and, turning around near the Boston Public Gardens, I made my way up Newbury Street - sweet jesus... Itâs like they WANT you to feel poor. What is Newbury Street, you ask?  [ahem]...  Newbury Street - an elongated shrine to the gods of self-service, affluence, and narcissism interrupted only by churches made mock ancient against a backdrop of concrete steel and neon blurred by clouds of dust and annihilation. The street is clogged with unbridled decadence; tapas spots, tea bars, italian suits w/matching brief cases, chittering midnight colored laptops, Silver BMW stallions, greased toupees, mannequins stowed posing in artifacts behind storefront glass, and all around the air is thick with the scent of business mingled with precious poisons - it issues out from under sidewalk cafe umbrellas and brass clad pub fronts.  Itâs a Freudian garden of lust and sensual satisfaction - a wanton exhibition of fast talk and dirty cash - a grotesque transaction driven circus of elite members only juggernauts - a modern-day awareness optional bathhouse for capitalism's love slaves - a brothel for the outwardly polished yet inwardly crude. It is a den of well dressed thieves and manicured charlatans, and it is abundantly populated with easy prey.  I could hardly contain myself...  âTerror! Violence! Folly! Break down the lighted poles! Smash the tempered glass! Send the seasoned meats and pompous wines up in clouds of smoke and ash! Tear the drapes and rend the banners! Render them unfettered! Leave them to relish the consequences of their ill gotten nobility whilst they beat their brows sore in the wake of equityâs revolution. Set their hands to clay and wood. Acquaint them with sweat and ache! Renew their palms with calluses and blisters! Release them from their illusions! Bid them feast at the table of righteous humility! For it is good that they should suffer... and likewise we also with them. And having blessed them thusly, we may rest our vengeance so, gathered together, we may restore them to the bonds of fellowship from whence our strength and dignity flowsâ  This place was trendy/upscale city. Iâve honestly never seen anything like it. I almost felt bad walking on the sidewalk with old sneakers. Add to that the aforementioned thoughts and you have a fella bursting at the seams with rebellion. I was, in fact, just about the kick off the revolution when I heard...  âMEEEEEEEEP! ... ... ... MEEEEEEEEEEEEEP!â  [wtf?]  and again... closer...   âMEEEEEEEEP! ... ... ... MEEEEEEEEEEEEEP!â  And then I saw him...  An old man peddling a tricycle cart with a Red Sox banner streaming off of the back. His âmeep meepingâ was his only horn. And on the back of this wundercart? Four stickers that read âKryptoniteâ and one, the coup de gras that read âI [heart] Dickâ.   Swear to God... I [Heart] Dick.  I pray heâs not family.  I kept on past a rare jazz quartet of 2 guitars, a bass, and a drummer. They were decent. I kept on. I noticed that every couple of blocks there were people offering massages complete with the chair and such... right on the sidewalk... and they were doing decent business. I kept on. Past THE Fridayâs [see yesterdayâs post], past a number of trinket shops, coffee houses, and trendy sidewalk eateries.   Finally, I was nearing the end of the yellow brick road. To my surprise, a man who, at first glance seemed interested only in making cat calls at young gals and handing out magazines, asked me for change.  I flat out lied.  It had been the second time that day.  Right then I decided to come up with a better way of turning down homeless folk. Something honest thatâs just short of ânoâ... or just plain ânoâ. Lying is not gonna cut it.  That moral dilemma solved, I headed back to the apt for some email checking and online jabbering.  After a few hours, it was off to meet Sean at the New England Conservatory [NEC] and, from there, to his house to plan out this concert.  [concert info: http://www.38cameron.com/music/socialforum.htm]  After some unwinding, a bit of planning, a quest for chinese food, and the late night arrival of Dave [Trench Coat Dave] and Eric Rey [Conga Player Extrodinaire] it was time to catch the late bus back home for some late night reminiscing and some quality sleep.  ... for tommorow we rock the forum.",male,24,Internet,Aries,0
378497,1510754,2004-06-06,"Man oh man am I glad THATâS over...  Thursday nightâs post ended with    ...it was time to catch the late bus back home for some late night reminiscing and some quality sleep. Tommorow we rock the forum.    ...and I meant every word of it. I needed sleep so very badly. The show would take up all of Saturday and I had to be fresh.  It would not be so.  I ended up staying up later than I had planned [writing the damn post] and went to bed at around 4. Now that wouldnât have been a problem normally - I didnât have to be up until between 11 and Noon.  I hadnât factored Sean and Dave (Ripley) into my sleep plans.  I get my first call at 5:40 AM. Itâs a Dave/Sean Chorus - Theyâre chanting/speaking the message into the machine... they want me to wake up. Practical Joke... funny guys... I smile and turn over in my sleep.   I was wrong.  I kept getting phone calls until 7:25 in the morning - 7 calls in all - one phone call about every 20 min. Just enough to keep me awake. Marvelous. I finally get out of bed to answer the phone now that it had become clear that they wouldnât stop calling until theyâd reached me. I pick up the phone in the middle of what was to be their last message and, after he realizes heâs no longer on the machine but has reached me, this is what he says:    Drew, I knew youâre probably pissed at us but Dave and I have been up all night, we;ve hatched a crazy plan, and we desperatly need your help.    [Oh no]  Their plan?   The Boston ""T"" Party ...  We'd get ourselves onto a train [a ""T""], and... well... party. Singing, dancing, playing instruments - oh and handing out all things ""T""; Golf tees, t-shirts, tea, pictures of ""Mr. T"", etc. all while dressed like swashbuckling pirates. And they were pretty well set on it. I could see that I had two options. Join this caravan of [insert adjective here] and man the brakes or leave them to their own devices and be caught at the venue sans two performers (Sean, in particular, who's name is all over the event). Plus I wouldn't miss an event like that for the life of me. So I joined 'em.  With the concert being THAT NIGHT, we had to act fast. And, after about 30-40 min of planning [and discussing what we believed to be the legal hurdles] it became clear that this was a tremendous idea. It had just come at the wrong time. We abandoned the T Party and I, for better or worse, got back into bed feeling [insert adjective here].  I get up with JUST enough time to get dressed and book over to Cambridge. The venue was amazing... and a little smaller than I had expected. No matter. We walked around and got a feel for it -- checking out sound (live spots, dead spots) planning out the seating, etc. etc. My role had already morphed from performer to emcee the day before so I wasn't worried about warming up or doing a sound check. That position didn't last long either. I found myself cutting sound-checks short so that others could ge ta sound check, fielding phone calls for Sean, doing some last minute planning with Judy (one of the event coordinaters), clearning the stage, making a set list... thus I became the show manager. It happened naturally and, to e honest, as much as I wanted to perform, I wanted more to make sure that this thing went as smooth as possible.  It was awesome.  The performers were incredible - every one of them. The house was full, Brother Blue rocked the house with ""The Butterfly Story"" - a perfect evening.  ...I fell asleep in a chair somewhere in the venue while the last of the equippment was being packed away.

It scared me at first - mostly because I assumed that I had been alone in the apartment this whole time. This new guest was, at this point, neither entirely welcome nor entirely unwelcome. I mean, hell, he could have been here first. That aside, I immediately made plans to dispose of the lilâ guy - The Grand Usurper. Cute or no, he had to go.  but I didnât...  ...and Iâm not entirely sure if I will. He only comes out at night, pretty much keeps to himself, and thereâs really no food for him here. Odds are that heâll go away on his own someday. If he doesnât, that ok too. Itâs nice to have some company every now and again - even if he doesnât speak english.  He was here to greet me after I had returned from my nightmare on Sunday.  The night before (Saturday) I had gotten plenty of sleep but, waking up on Sunday morning around 9:00/10:00, I was still beat... and sore... and not at all in the mood for marching. We were supposed to meet up at the NEC around 10:45 so I had no time to lose. I showered, got dressed, packed up my whatnots, and headed out the door.  At the school, little to nothing went wrong. A kid didnât show. Another kid was late. We couldnât reach Tom [our âinâ to the Boston City Band] and we didnât know how to get where we were going. We knew it was in Dorchester though so we decided to chance finding it on our own and we took off.  Madness ensued.  Finding Tom, waiting for Tom, getting lost, getting unlost, finding parking, not finding the band, JoMoâs freakout [trumpet player], and... best of all...  The parade route was nearly 3.5 miles [3.2 to be exact]... and, five minutes after we started marching [in short sleeved shirts and black pants], it started raining. And kept raining. Hard.  My body, still protesting the previous dayâs adventure,  was outraged. Muscles clenched, tendons tightened, bones stiffened... my skin took on a grayish hue and leathery leathery texture.  I was in marching band hell.  I kept chanting â$$$, $$$â to myself hoping that my body would hold out. And, thankfully it did. Barely. By the end up the parade, I couldnât even open my hands or speak clearly. When I got my check, I couldnât put it into my pocket, let alone take it from the directorâs hand. My body was a disaster.  oh... and we still had to walk back.  Thatâs right - no transportation... we had to walk 3+ miles back to the start of the parade.  Joy.  Luckily there was a T station nearby. We hopped it and got within a mile or so of our destination and walked the rest of the way back under a drippy grey sky.   I was dead by the time I got home.  I collapsed in a wet pile of bones and skin on my bed and was asleep instantly.  Sean came by briefly after I had gotten some rest and, after a brief visit to his place, I went over to Woddyâs for Pabst and Bradbury.

All I can say is wow... just... wow...  but Iâm getting ahead of myself...  I spent most of the day practicing with Frankpipe, making plans for the show, and generally bugging out and having a good time with the band. We were slated to go on at 10 so, like good boys, we saddled up early and were at the venue around 9. Unfortunatly, we werenât going on until damn near midnight.  Bummer.  So be it. We hung out, had a few beers, got some din-din, and enjoyed the other bands. They were damn good if I do say so myself. After the others went on, it was time to âlight the pipeâ so to speak. We hopped on stage and began to rock.  My GOD did I have fun.  It was a night of several firsts for me; my first show in Boston, my first time singing in a show, my first time beaking out of my shell and just out and out enjoying myself, my first time rocking out [hard] with Frankpipe. We left the crowd damn near speechless.  Think Zappa... now add acid...  ...lilâ more...  ...lilâ more...  ...ok a LOT more...  there you go... THATâS Frankpipe.

I like electric guitar fine but Iâm really an acoustic man. And, should that electric guitar end up being mine, I was almost 100% sure that I was going to sell it/trade it for an acoustic.

The back plate had been taken of off the Alverez so itâd be a little while before it could be sold but that left no reason not to take a look around at a few stores to see what they had to offer.  I played a million guitars. Thereâs blood on the floor of every major guitar dealer in Boston thanks to me.   Bitchinâ.  And then I saw her... A Blue Sunburst Ibanez... Abby. As soon as I started to play, I knew this was the one I wanted. I started silently counting the band gigs it would take until she would be mine.  Sean bought it on the spot. Just like that. And, just like that, I had a guitar. Goodbye, Alverez. Hello Abby.  Say hi to the nice people:  http://www.ibanez.com/guitars/guitar.asp?model=PF15MS  I was speechless for a long time.  This is the best gift ever.  I played until my body demanded I cease.  After that, I went to Woodyâs with Bradbury for a tasty beverage [read: PBR].  ...  Iâm not a fan of old movies. Itâs not that I donât like them, I just donât watch them. Last night I saw âWhat Ever Happened to Baby Jane?â.   [I was in a âfamilyâ bar at the time - it was apparently âmovie nightâ - ânuff said]  Wow. Bette Davis scares me even more now... 'specially now that I know who she is.   I stayed for the whole thing.   I walked the 3-4 miles back to my apt instead of taking the T. Why? Exactly.

378501,1510754,2004-06-11,"6.10.2004   That morning, I was up at the ungodly hour of 5:47. I blame the media. Theyâre as good a scapegoat as anyone else. It was raining... again.... ugh. Bring back my stifling heat! I cued up Durufleâs Sanctus [Maurice Durufle: Requiem Op. 9 (1947) - Sanctus]. Just at the piece reached itâs climax, the sun broke through the clouds. You really have to hear the piece to appreciate what Iâm talking about. It was epic.  After a day of rocking out/sitting on my ass/stuffing my face with pasta and assorted goodness, I headed over to see Sean at the NEC to get some guitar books. Of course something went wrong :)... and itâs about time!! I had locked myself out of the apartment.  [Blast!]  [Drat!]  ...and so I waited with Sean on the steps of my apartment... jamming intermittently, of course.   After a long while, we headed to Seanâs place.   That night, after some quasi-munchies, we headed over to the Hard Rock Cafe on Clarendon. Sometimes She Burns, Seanâs brother Kyleâs band, was competing in a battle of the bands competition.  They rocked.  Hard.  ...and lost.  Some rinky-dink band called âThe Boxâ beat them out. In the end, though, I enjoyed the show tremendously. The band was amazing. The events manager at the Hard Rock gave them an invite to come back for a band showcase so all was not lost.  After the show, Kyle and I piled into his car with some band equippment and I, stinking drunk and deliriously hapy, crashed at Kyleâs place.  On to today...  6.11.2004   I got back to my apartment at around 11:30 and the superintendent let me in. Thank God. Sean and I talked a while about summer plans and other such things. After a bit, Sean took off to play in Harvard Square and I broke out the 4-track to start experimenting.  Iâm planning on recording an album in the next year or so [stop laughing] tenatively titled âLittle Green Lifeâ. Figure thatâll keep me practicing... plus I can probably get Sean in on it - itâll be fun. I have about 4 songs so far - only one of which is anywhere near finished. Weâll see. Iâm working on a new song tenatively titled âLittle Green Life (Are You Sleeping?)â. That along with âLong Day (Running Man)â, âShine Downâ and âPart of the Reasonâ will fill out the beginning of the supposed album. Iâm busting my hump trying to improve my guitar playing so that the recordings will be bearable to listed to - let alone worthy of purchase. Iâm trying to get away from imitating other artists but, at this stage in the game, I think itâs ok. Iâm still learning and, soon enough, my own sound/style will emerge. Itâs there but itâs still very reminicent of Dave and John Mayer... which I guess is an improvement on where I was about a month ago.  Tonight? - Iâm heading to a birthday party for Ken - the drummer from the aforementioned band Sometimes She Burns. Should be fun. Iâve now decided to post when I can. Itâll still be once a day but some accounts may include the end of one day and the beginning of another. Thatâs more or less a function of the madness that my life has become.

It was worse than normal. Probably worse than ever... I talked for hours and hours straight on... I only paused to get beer and go to the bathroom... oh and that 45 min span where I inhaled 61 burgers and 3 hot dogs... I was soooo hungry.... So that was Kenâs in a nutshell. Me - drinking - chatting (telling HORRIBLY personal life stories that no one wanted to hear at all [translation: tales of butt sex.... (shame)].  It was wonderfully grim. I knew only one person at that party.  I still donât know if I was the one that moved the conversation into the âbutt sexâ realm. More than likely I was to blame.  Saturday morning comes and off we go to the Boston Pride Parade. It was not what I expected. Everyone pretty much had some combination of four things going on:  * Collecting donations for an agenda * passing out agenda related propaganda * Advertising random non gay specific goods and services on floats full of mega waif scantily clad dancing ""bois"" (and nothing but dancing boys) * Lube  That was all...  oh no wait... I lie.  There was an all gay Rugby Team.  ...  [ahem]  There was an all gay Rugby Team   After that, the rest of my day meant nothing. It was all about rugby.   Hours later at my apartment with pockets full of glow in the dark condoms, lube, propaganda, and lint, I found myself picking up my guitar again and, of course, rocking out.  Now THATâs what I call Pride.  My day ended early which means, as Iâm sure you regular readers know by now:  I march with the Boston City Band in the AM.   [Christing!]",male,24,Internet,Aries,0

Midday posting - bad  Late night hijinks recounting - good   [noted]   Mondayâs posts comes late tonight... keep your eyes peeled  So... how was Sunday...    6.13.04   I woke up with little time to spare and, after some online hellos and some quick personal hygiene, I sped off to the NEC. Today was to be yet another exciting day with the Boston City Band. Joy. I got there around 9:30 and we made off for Charlestown and Bunker Hill.  We arrived at 9:45-10 or so. This quaint lilâ NE town looked as if all of itâs residents had stayed up all night dusting this and polishing that. There was hardly so much as a gum wrapper to be seen. All the houses looked freshly painted. All the porches and lawns were swept and neatly trimmed. To be honest, it was a little creepy. It was almost  too  clean. Thank you, Stephen King, for fueling my suspicions. I got over it - weâd be marching soon and Iâd be back in my filthy well worn neighborhood. Generally, we show up an hour before we actually have to march which mean the parade would kick off around 11 am.  The parade began at 1.  For two hours, we hung out under trees outside of a church. Then we were moved to a place by the water @ a military facility... then to another spot in the sun... then to yet another spot in the sun... were we broiled while we waited.  After we were nice and tired from being in the sun for so long, the parade finally began - 4 miles of uphill/downhill/uphill/downhill at a driving grandmaâs pace with little to no shade at all. What fun! What glorious fun! To make matters worse, the townsfolk - now back from church and out of their fresh pressed Sundayâs best - were firing up grill after grill. Meat sizzled and charred. Vegetables roasted and streamed. They stuffed their faces as they watched the shambling rag-tag spectacle that was The Boston City Band. I nearly ate my own hand.  [Jesus take me now]  The parade ended just in time. It only took  two and one half HOURS  to march those 4 miles under a cruel christian sun. Going home, I was comforted by the sounds of  urlLink Mr. Bungleâs  After School Special.   sing along...

Not only that, itâs  always  worked. It was never broken.  Wow.  So, after the parade, I made use of this [creepy, oh god, Iâm gonna die!] elevator. I escaped with my life and walked into my apartment. I felt like a half melted ice cream sundae. No matter. I was determined to [sleep] make something of the rest of my day. I got an IM from Tom [Boston Tom, not CT(naked)Tom]  inviting me to check out this chorus, Coro Allegro. It was only a few miles away and, after deciding against the block party, I went over to the church where they were rehearsing.  Madness ensued.  A drunken sunburned middle-aged bigot found the place before I did and, when I arrived, he was enlightening the group on the evils of homosexuality [read: yelling barely intelligible nonsense mingled with âfagots!â and other choice words]. Tom and a few others calmly escorted him out into the streets again and, after a series of kicks and shouts, he was gone.  The choir was awesome.  I know what you CDN folk are thinking and youâre right. Particularly since they were doing a piece in Latin. It wasnât too hard sitting back and not commenting - in fact, it was rather nice. The director was damn good and, surprisingly, I learned some things while I was enjoying myself (he pointed out all the things I pointed out with you, CDN - maybe these are universal issues)... but I was fading fast. After a good rehearsal, Tom brought me home and, after a brief story time,  I charged up the stairs (not the elevator).  The story would have ended right here had I not thought of Woodyâs.  I had to âstay regularâ.  I went and got the beer that I had promised myself. It was glorious. Bradbury had tagged along or I would have gone home sooner.

The previous night, around about the same time that I was making those plans, I made lunch plans w/Colin. So, after laundry (which made my clothes smell kinda funny), I headed over to Harvard Square to eat a cheap yet satisfying lunch at a chinese place with Colin. Good times. We talked and laughed and such and, of course, he had to get back to work all too soon. After a brief goodbye, I headed over to a pay phone to call Sean. He and another band memebr were planning on playing somewhere in Havard Square. I called and asked where he was. âTurn aroundâ, came the voice on the other end. I turned. He smiled. I had wasted 50 cents.  We eventually found Joe (trumpet, vocals) and set up near the Havard T exit and jammed a bit. Good times. Tom and I ate at Pizzaria Unoâs. I had the Peanut Butter cup thing. It was good.  Yay.  Then it was off to home.  My sweet Christ of life was it ever hot. I prayed for death. I got home just in time to get a laptop from Tom [Frankpipe Tom] and then it was off to meet Tom [Boston Tom] at the T.  [Too many Toms?

Around noon, after a long shower and a vigorous brushing of the teeth, I was refreshed... somewhat. Another nap finished the job and, soon after that, it was off the the Boston City Band (BCB) [Today it was actually the Worchester Brass Band (WBB)] gig in Dedham. We met at a 7-11 in Jamaica Plain and, while we were waiting, The Kryptonite Cart/I Heart Dick Cart guy returned [ urlLink see previous post ]. And he was âMEEEEP-ingâ.  Wonderful.  In Dedham, a fight broke out.  We got to Dedham 45 min late and, after a brief frenzy, we found our fellow band mates and we geared up and headed off to start the parade. About 3/4 of the way through, we came across a vendor who was blocking half of the road. âWeâll just go around himâ, I thought. Not so. One of the BCB veterans marching to my immediate right pushed the cart out of the way... with great force. The vendor, not pleased, retaliated and, predictably, a fight ensued. I was marching on completely unaware of what was happening behind me. When half of the band stopped playing, I chanced a glance behind me to see a number of band members confronting the vendor.  Magnificent.  It didnât come to blows but the vendor did return to heckle us. I couldnât help but think âHeckling is cool and it gets you kicked out of things - both of which are very toughâ...   ...personal joke  Oh...  At the same time that this was all happening, a couple kids thought it would be a good idea to toss a stink bomb into the bell of the sousaphone playerâs bell. They hit it dead on and the stank was great. The sousaphone player kept playing despite the horrible stench that he was now breathing in.  God Bless him.  The parade ended with no more fiascos.  I canât say I wasnât disappointed.  We dropped a couple guys off and then went to Annaâs, a mexican joint, where I was introduced to the Super Burrito - the largest and fastest prepared burrito I have ever had. less than a minute and bigger than a childâs arm. I devoured it in under 5 min. We gathered our ruined bodies up and went home.  Sean was knocking at the door before I had even had a chance to consider masturbating before a long night of sleep.

I was partly hoping to find a reason compelling enough to come back to CT once the summer was over. To be honest, as much as I miss those guys, there wasn't much of one. I can always visit from time to time. Not finding a reason to go back was good and bad - good because I think that Boston may be the place for me right now... bad because I kinda wanted to be pulled back to CT.

Wellâ¦ itâs like thisâ¦   6.30.2004 - 7.03.2004 - On Beyond Pabst, BCB Magesty, and The Buck Stops Here   Henry picked me up at the apt and brought me up to Boston. We  urlLink hit the bar â¦ hardâ¦ [ouch]â¦ Thanks Henryâ¦  So yeah, I got back on Friday, partied hard with Henry (it was his birthday celebration) and woke up on Saturday in time for a Rockout[!] festival like none other.  Finally, the  Boston City Band  was playing Middleford.  [Hallelujah Chorus]  Can you say bucolic Christian paradise? And free soda at the end of the parade? â [sigh] - What a wonderful slice of Northeastern Americana! For my money, it doesn't get any better than Jesus and tractors [insert club remix of Plowin' with my Savior by DJ Whatshisnuts]. Anywho, the parade was decent and fairly uneventful. Which was kinda disappointing. THE  urlLink vendor  was spotted at least once and I was secretly hoping for a follow-up battle. Unfortunatlly, it was not in the cards.   [le sigh]  After taking advantage of the sweet free sodee-pop, The  BCB  packed it up and moved it out. Back in Boston, we went our separate ways and I prepared Casa Drew for Chris Buckâs arrival. I had almost forgotten that he was coming up. Buck showed up and, wouldnât you know it, I had been invited to a party at Kyleâs [Seanâs older brother] place.  Sweeeeeeeet.  We ate din-din at Woodyâs [god bless you bacon and pepperoni pizza!] and then high-tailed it to JP for some buffoonery.  I got the worst case of  urlLink hiccups  of my life. Hands down.  I canât really describe it better than that except to say that it was plain awful and I had âmassive nuclear meltdownâ heartburn. I was hiccupping every 15 seconds and letting out these horrendous âhalf-burpsâ. Jesus. What a bad scene. Sleep couldnât come fast enough.  And now? â As I write this, itâs 5:42 in the morning on the fourth of July, Chris Buck is sleeping like a lilâ baby Jesus on my couch, and my day looks something like this:   9amish â 11ish  Mom is visiting and weâre going out to breakfast. Thatâs rightâ¦ mom is visiting. I have so much crap to clean/hide.   11amish â 6pmish  Parades! Parades! Parades! What a whore I amâ¦ 2 parades today on this, our independence day [cue patriotic music]. If I didnât so desperately need the money I swearâ¦ though in all honesty Iâd probably still do a few here and there. I mean, heh, Iâm not above the BCB, baby. [foâ shizzle]   6pmish - whenever, baby  Chris Buck and I are going out for a night on the town... a night we won't soon forget!

378513,1510754,2004-07-05,"Ok - let review...  According to my  urlLink last post , my schedule for today ( in italics ) was as follows:    9amish â 11ish  Mom is visiting and weâre going out to breakfast. Thatâs rightâ¦ mom is visiting. I have so much crap to clean/hide.   That never happened. My aunt, who would have tagged along, had car trouble which translated to no visit from mom. It was disappointing but so be it. I'm sure she'll make it up some other time. And we at least got some phone shennanigans in leiu of a person to person visit. For now, I'm willing to be content with that.    11amish â 6pmish Parades! Parades! Parades!  What a whore I amâ¦ 2 parades today on this, our independence day [cue patriotic music]. If I didnât so desperately need the money I swearâ¦ though in all honesty Iâd probably still do a few here and there. I mean, heh, Iâm not above the BCB, baby. [foâ shizzle]   Well now... here's how  that  dance of shame went down...  We met up at the good ol'  urlLink NEC  (standard) and headed off with absolutly  no idea  of how to get where we were going (also standard). After some slick maphandling skills on my part [translation: I found the town on the map - big accomplishment for me] we were headed west to the town of  urlLink Sudbury .  Despite the cops who, all of which, seemed to be entirely uninterested in giving us directions to either the start of the parade or a place where we could park, we found a place to seat Tom's oh so choice Volvo and we unloaded. 10 min later, freshly shirted, shod, and bearing instruments, we trucked over to meet the rest of the band.  It was hotter than a lesbian daisy chain outside. The sky was a hectic blue and the sun glared mercilessly down on our motley crew. Needless to say, after about 40 yards, we were panting and sweating. A lil' group of politically inclinded Sudburians saw our plight and offered us ice water. God Bless them. Soon after, the bands (Wooster Brass and Boston City) formed like Voltron and we set out for to make a spectacle of ourselves.  The parade, though long and brutally hot, was awesome. Every 5 yards, someone was offering us ice water. The crowd not only smiled and waved but cheered and clapped along to whatever we happened to be playing... including the cadance. Barbeques burned, cute children were in abundance, and we were encouraged onward by a sea of amiling faces. I've hardly ever seen a more appreciative crowd - never with the BCB.  Don't get me wrong now, kids. The parade was still a hellish nightmare festival (again, standard). However, Sudbury definitly made me feel appreciated.  Hail to thee, fair Sudbury!  The parade ended without much hullabaloo and, you guessed it, it was off to parade number two - this time in  urlLink Norwood . This one wasn't nearly as inviting as Sudbury.  The parade was set to begin at 4:30 which fit perfectly into my earlier made plans to hang out with Buck from about 6 on. When we got there, we found out the parade had been moved up an hour to 5:30. No Biggie. Then we waited around forever - well past 5:30. My plans with Chris (Buck) were shot to hell. Finally, after an eternity or two, we were on the parade route and doing our Boston City bestest to ""hype the crowd"". About midway through [stopped on the route - hindered by a troupe of gypsies - hand to god] our Tuba player somehow got a fan club. A bunch of [hopelessly adorable] kids came up and were standing off at a bit of a distance trying to figure out what the hell it was that he was carrying. He did a great thing... he scared the bejesus out of 'em by growling in a huge voice through the Sousaphone and chasing the little kids. It was wonderful. He played with these kids until it was time to move on. The kids were deliriously happy. The Tuba player earned a bit more of my respect. What a swell guy. We finished up the parade without incident and, after a few hangups (totaling a little more than an hour), we were on our way back to Boston. By now it was about 9:20 PM and I would have gotten back to Boston by around 9:45 had we not run across that damned Krispy Kreme.  It's even better than you can imagine.  We walked in, brought our instruments, played, and got 2 dozen doughnuts.   Free.   Clearly, no one can resist the power of the BCB. After that, it was off to home for me.   6pmish - whenever, baby Chris Buck and I are going out for a night on the town... a night we won't soon forget! [insert 80's power rock ballad here] Jillian's fits into our plans somewhere. Evening, thy name is Jackassery!   I was met by a calm and understanding Chris Buck on my stoop. I was more than 3 hours late and, though it had been out of my control, it still sucked hard. There was really only one option for us at this point.  We went to  urlLink Jillian's  - three stories of beer, pool, bowling [that's right] and a number of other fun things - and right next to  urlLink Fenway !. Jillian's is HUGE! Bigger than all the Uconn bars combined... easily... and on three floors, my friends. We ended our night with beer, chicken, and billards.  Good times.  Home was a short walk away. Just how short, you ask?

378514,1510754,2004-07-06,"Today, the BCB went over to bless the town of Needham with our sultry siren song repetoire of ill fated obscure military marching band compositions. All towns should be so lucky. Oh, and we had a dozen of the Krispy Kreme donughts left from  urlLink the day before . And the parade promised to be short and sweet. So... awesome! We drove over and found the town with little trouble. It was parking that was a problem.  There were  clowns  in the parking lot.  2 troops of  clowns .  My heart was set to ""hummingbird"".  No matter - the clowns didn't give us any trouble. We warmed up a bit, got into our parade block and marched a very short [and friggin wet] parade. The rain wasn't all that bad seeing as how the parade was mindlessly short. When it was all over, we collected our checks and started the short trek back to our cars.  ...and then there were clowns...  On the way back to our car, we saw a pair of them - one on a clown bike and one on foot in those super evil clown shoes that they wear. Crestfallen and soaked (due to the rain... which made their make-up streaky and all the more frightening) they ambled down the road in the same direction we were headed. Mike Winograd [Frankpipe - sax/vocals/keys] whips out his clarinet and plays a ""happy clown song"" to cheer them up. They ignore us entirely. This was not taken well by Jesse, one of our number, who immediatly busted out with ""Everybody hates clowns!"". The clowns hung their heads in shame and continued walking (all the more depressed) back to their car.  Back at the cars, we began stripping of the Boston City Band getups and putting on our ""less dignified"" street clothes. The clowns were there too, though they showed no sign of changing clothes any time soon. We still had donughts from the day before, thank God, and a mini snackfest broke out.  Something about the doughnuts spooked the clowns.  The clowns parked near us saw the box of donughts and  FLIPPED OUT  - hard. They started by talking amongst themselves in some ""other"" language [Clownese or something] all scary high and creepy. It was all so surreal. Finally, they reached some sort of consensus and one of them [their leader?] screamed:   ""Donughts! Attack!""   ...in a crazy high shrill voice.  If my pants weren't around my ankles, I would have gotten the hell out of dodge right then and there.  Thank God we left soon after. They had started hitting on Jesse (who is 14 years old by the way - they hit on him more when we told them this) and it was clear that it was time to get gone. We escaped with our lives [whew!] and made it back to Boston in one piece. I retreated to my apartment and promptly passed out.  The rest of the day was clown free; Spider Man 2 (wicked awesome), some decent potato skins, and now this - posting. Tommorow is looking to be fairly uneventful and I'm looking forward to that. Though I wouldn't mind an adventure or two...  ...so long as there are  no clowns ...  zzz...",male,24,Internet,Aries,0
378515,1510754,2004-07-07,"Ok, kids. Here it is, as promised â a small list of the strange and wonderful cast of Bostonites that Iâve met since Iâve been here. Iâll try and lump them into relevant groups so you all donât get lost. Letâs get started.   Frankpipe!   Frankpipe is the reason Iâm in Boston. Weâre a Zappa-esque rock band with damn near innumerable influences. Here is Frankpipe in no particular orderâ¦   Sean Frenette  Best friend since high school â wicked guitar player â mildly eccentric â lead guitar   Joe âJomoâ Moffett  The Pipeâs front man â awesome trumpet player â balls to the wall insane and funny â trumpet/lead vocals   Mike Winograd  Token Jew â best clarinet player Iâve ever heard â pop music fanatic â sax/keys/vocals   Dave Goodchild  Frankpipe newbie â ungodly talented bassist  â ridiculously quick study â bass   Thomas Monaghan  Buthole Bob â sick percussionist â BCB demigod â drums   Me  Dexter aka âThe Revâ â struggling beginner guitarist â negro extrodinaire â trombone/vocals     The Boston City Band/Wooster Brass Band/Windjammer Band/etc.    These are all actually the same band technically speaking. I wonât get into it here. Check out my  urlLink previous post  concerning that whole deal. Here they are in no particular order:   Trombone Nazi(s)  - one of the many old men who play drum major from within the ranks of the BCB. They calls the tunes, they bark the starts and stops, and they critique your playing and marching no matter how awful they themselves are. Nothing is âBoston Cityâ enough for the Nazis. Oh, and if you couldnât tell from their title, they all play trombone. Theyâre never really referred to by name.   The Bunny Hat Lady or Madame Vericose  -  crooked teeth, large glassy eyes, tired sallow skin, and a healthy crop of varicose veins are all her trademark features. She wears the drum major uniform but, trust me, kids, she is anything but a drum major. She, too, barks commands or, on occasion, blows her whistle. She may or may not do either in tandem with one of the Trombone Nazis â and, by the way, ALL commands given by her or the Nazis are not at all in time. She wields this drum major mace like some geriatric ninja. I would not be surprised if she had a bad case of jaundice or the goutâ¦ or both. On her head, she wears this ultra-fabulous fluffy white super bonnet. Hence the title âBunny Hat Ladyâ.   Hardcore! Drummer  - Sheâs been marching parades for YEARS and, damn it, she is the very definition of a hardcore drummer when it comes to parade time. Her hands are bandaged and knotted with arthritis but she plays with the fierceness of an entire snare line. Donât get me wrong â sheâs not in the same class as the Nazis or the Bunny Hat Lady. She is one of the sweetest women in the BCB â super friendly, soft spoken, always smiling, and downright loveable.   The Glockenspiel Lady  - Oh boy. What a wonder! Ok. Damn the physical description. Imagine a glockenspiel player whoâs understanding of tonality is light years beyond that of most mere mortals. She plays  whatever she wants  regardless of the key signature (though, before each tune, she turns to ask the Trombone Nazi what key the piece is in). In all honesty, that may be an understatement. I have never once heard her play in any discernable key whatsoever. Itâs rather miraculous. Added to that, she marches like a cartoon character and has no concept of gate turns. Good thing she marches solo in front of the band.   Russel K. Wiesman aka Russ  - The very heart and soul of the BCB â our fearless leader. Though he does not march, Russ is responsible for everything else BCB related including doling out paychecks at the end of each parade. He often follows behind the band during parades in his trademark white van. The parade life can get hectic and, as a result, it is generally a bad idea to try and talk to Russ before a parade begins. He has no time for your nonsense.     Sometimes She Burns [ urlLink SSB ]   This is Seanâs older brother Kyleâs band. Theyâre damn good. Check out their  urlLink website â¦ w00t:   Kyle Frenette  â Guitar/Vocals â My other big broâ¦ constantly looking out for me and/or filling me with beer. My storytelling skills pale in comparison.   Ken Dziok  â Drums â Nasty drummer with a heart of Pabst. Newest in a long line of SSB drummers â all around decent guy.   Miguel Paucar  â Guitar/Vocals â Miguel is probably my favorite guitar player to watch. The kid plays with freakish amounts of energy â goddamn you if you donât dance. Rolls his own cigarettes and, again, is an all around decent guy.    Corinto Cevallos [?]  â Bass â Corinto is the only member of the band that Iâve never once spoken to or interacted with in any way. He tends to disappear after shows and Iâve only seen him at one partyâ¦ soâ¦ I mean I guess thatâs that.      Other Friendly Neighborhood Bostonites      Brother Blue  â Heâs a multi-degree carrying, world traveling storyteller â Bostonâs official storyteller, in fact. Phenomenally brilliant, gifted, and moreover, friendly and approachable. He has a storytelling session on Tuesday nights in Cambridge.   Ruth Edmonds Hill  â The wife of Blueâ¦ equally intelligent, sheâs the glue that keeps Blue together and, honestly, vice-versa   Tom aka Boston Tom  â Another decent Boston fella. Heâs great at killing loneliness and, whatâs more, he sings. He sings and plays guitar [thatâs right, Christian]. We hang out from time to time. Heâs one of the only people Iâve met independent of Sean.   Colin  â Yet another decent Boston fella. Heâs normally the guy Iâm out to lunch with when my away message says âout to lunchâ or something to that effect. He usually comes equipped with a bunch of jokes and stories â good times. The only only person I've met independant of Sean.   Woodyâs Lady  â The bartender at Woodyâsâ¦ she doles out Pabst like it was penicillin. Sheâs a big Ray Bradbury as well (among other authors) so we have a lot to talk about. Hail to thee, Giver of Pabst!   The Heckling Bum  â Believe it or not, near the NEC, thereâs an angry bum. Donât you DARE give him pennies or [gasp!] food. He will seriously bitch you out and, if youâre particularly unlucky, heâll throw your donation back in your face. He yells at passersby who donât give him the change he craves and, I recently found out, he lives  in a better apartment than I do . Sheesh.   Abby  â My preeecioussssssssâ¦ [my guitar]    So thatâs that. Those are all the main characters that make their way into my posts from time to time. Now â how about the past two daysâ¦    7.06.2004   Ouchâ¦ ouch ouch ouch ouch ouch ouch ouch ouch ouch ouch ouch ouch ouch ouchâ¦  My poor bodyâ¦ the parades have done evil things to my body. I was so sore â sweet Jesus.  Aside from that, not much else happened. I used my day the only way I knew howâ¦ sleepingâ¦ hard.   7.07.2004   [see  7.06.2004 ] Add in lunch with Tom and, beside that, I had another long, uneventful, and somewhat restful day. Hopefully tomorrow will be a touch more exciting. Meantime, Iâm gonna make the most of the rest of my day by doing absolutely nothing at all.  Ciao for nowâ¦",male,24,Internet,Aries,0
378516,1510754,2004-07-08,So I'll make this short and sweet...  Sasquatch is here.   [trouble!]  ...  [news @ 11],male,24,Internet,Aries,0
378517,1510754,2004-07-15,"I'm beginning to realize that posting every single day may not be possible. In fact it's downright impossible sometimes. I'm just far to distracted, tired, hungry, etc. So that's that. I'll ask my regular readers to forgive me...   Moving on...  This past week was fairly interesting. Sasquatch's visit was nothing short of awesome. We wandered arounf the city taking in the sights, lunching, sipping at beer, and lounging in the apartment playing video games and generally reliving the good ol' ""Squatch 'n' Dexter"" days. The last night of this two day odyssey, we went to a jam session at the apartment of a mutual friend of Sean and myself a few blocks away. There we found a table laden with goodies and a bucket full of beer. People-wise, there were a number of eager musicians including 2 bass players, a drummer, a DJ, 2 vocalists, a guitarist, and a keyboard player.  We jammed the night away...  I haven't had that much fun in a jam session in quite a long time.  The next morning, it was time for Sasquatch to leave and, after a few days of contemplation, I decided to join him. Down in CT, my friends were throwing the 2nd annual Bastille Day Party.  This is, of course, where things went wrong.  I showed up with Scotty (recently freed from camp) to find several old friends, good food, decent beer, and bucket â a concoction with a rich history [read: sinister Jack Danielâs based masterpiece]  Partying ensued. Drunkenness followed. I injured my spine. Hereâs what happened.  At some point near or after midnight, Eric Bell and I decided that it would be a good idea to start wrestling. This madness, peppered with drunken laughter and embraces, went on for far too long. At one point, the lady of the house broke out the garden hose and sprayed us down. I got a decent portion of it straight up my nose.  Wonderful.  When the dust [mud] settled, Eric and I were pathetic, mud covered, grass stained, good time party boy bastards and the rest of the Bastille Day bunch were peeved to say the least. So be it. Our fun was done. At 3 AM, Scotty drove a drunk and bruised me back to his place where I promptly fell asleep on his carpet. I woke up without pants [?] and Scotty loaned me some dry clothes. Sasquatch and Dobbs picked me up and ferried me back to Tolland.  [whew!] I spent the next few days as a sore puppy on the couch.  During these days, I was trounced several times in some fairly gruesome chess matches by my good friend Ed. It was awful.  And then, one day, this happened:   Yahoo!

This is possible the best game Iâve ever played.  And now? â Iâm off to Maryland. I was hired by a company called ""BestEnglishSpanish"" to redo their website â it is an out and out nightmare. Phone and internet conversation were useless as far as resolving the problem goes and my boss invited me down to Maryland to meet with him and work all this out in person. Who knows? â This may be the start of something good.  One thing is for sureâ¦ I made good on my promise of a summer to remember.  After Maryland itâs back to CT for a Frankpiping good time [3 day retreat] followed by several days of performances.  Iâll update when I can â life sure isnât making it easy.

378518,1510754,2004-07-25,"ok ok ok... I know... long time no post...  This time, however, there was good reason. I've just landed after a week [+] worth of adventures. I'll explain...  My boss kinda screwed me.   My boss is a great guy.  Here's how that works.  I didn't have to worry about food or anything like that when I was down there - he even made me megagigantic steak burgers. Seriously these things were bigger than your creepy uncle's drinking problem - we're talkin' HUGE. Conversely, we had agreed that I'd make about 10 bucks an hour on this trial gig and, though I made a fair amount, the agreed upon pay rate was never to be. All told, I spent close to 70 hours on that web site. I got paid 200 bucks. You do the math. I'm not upset, mind you - I had a great time and, hell, I wouldn't have been doing much else during that time anyway. I do feel cheated but so be it. It's no big loss.  Before treking back to Boston, my boss and I grabbed some stuff from his apartment - laptop, clothes, etc. He was driving me back and then heading over to Long Island. While he packed, I occasionally brought some things out to the car. Once that was all over, I sat on the couch and tried to keep myself occupied. Looking up, I noticed to police officers outside of the door. I also noticed their standard issue firearms pointed in my direction.  [expletive!]  Oh... and did I mention? My boss is an astonomy buff and has all kinds of cool telescopes and such all over his apartment. When I saw the cops, I had a small telescope in my hands; a long metallic tube that could have easily been mistaken for a weapon - namely a firearm.  (Thank God we weren't in [clan] Manchester)  I dropped the telescope and put my hands up. I was about 80% certain that I was going to be shot and, honestly, it felt kinda cool. I imagined the sound, the pain, the scar, and, most importantly, what an  awesome  story I'd have afterwords. I shifted slightly in my seat in a vain attempt to position myself in such a way as to minimize damage to my favorite organs. My boss came out of his room just in time and walked over to the door and TADA!, saw some cops just itching to put a hole in something. He went outside and they disappeared behind a corner leaving me to make water in my pants on the couch in this suddenly hostile town.  Everything was cool.  What happened? - Well it turns out that my boss was supposed to be in Mexico for two more weeks and his neighbors didn't know that he had come back early. They look out of their windows to see a black man carrying things out of his apartment with him nowhere in sight [Mexico by their understanding]. They called the cops who showed up in John Wayne mode; guns blazin' and lookin' fer tha bad feller. So that's that. The cops went away [presumably disappointed at not having been given a reason to discharge their weapons - specifically  into  someone] and I finally put my hands down feeling somewhat dejected. I should have been shot.   It would have been awesome.  Anyway, disaster averted, we hopped into the car for the 6.5 hour ride to Boston.  ... ... ... ... ... ...   10 hours later , we crossed into CT. We had left Maryland at 2:30pm. It was past 1am when we finally got to Boston.   I hate cars forever.  The next morning, I woke up and, heh, it was time to leave again. After a rough night of sleep in my apartment, I grabbed my crap [there had been no need to unpack] and headed out again - this time to Glastonbury for the  urlLink Frankpipe  retreat and a week of pipey goodness. We all met up at Tom's [see  urlLink cast of characters ] place and, for the next bajillion hours, we rehearsed. Don't get me wrong, it  was  frustrating but we got a lot accomplished. Satisfied, we grabbed a room at the Hilton to relax before bedding down for the night.  Tae-Bo happened.  It's not what you think.  Perhaps this advice will suffice:  A rock band in a hotel is like a child molestor at a day care center - you'd be a  fool  not to expect something to go horribly wrong.   The details really aren't important [though I can hear your jaws smacking and watering for details]. We rocked. We slept soundly. I snored like a rape victim.  The next day, we rocked the farmer's market in Hartford. It really was that simple.  We had to [censor] ourselves so much of the time, we felt constricted. Nonetheless, we rocked out and our fans were pleased. We even got it on tape [video and plain audio] so keep your eyes and ears out for that one sometime in the future.  After that gig, we packed up and went our seperate ways. I hung out at Tom's for a few days and went swimming in Cotton Hollow - a creek nestled deep in the woods of Glastonbury. I also rocked out HARD on some  urlLink Mario Sunshine  [availible on Game Cube] and generally enjoyed time with Tom's family [saints all around].  After a few days at Chez Tommy, we headed over to Upton, Mass for a gig.  Again we rocked... harder... Jesus.  Despite the 40 billion to 1 human to mosquito ratio, we kicked ass. That night, I slept at Jomo's place [see  urlLink cast of characters ]. The following night, we were to rock out at the  urlLink Middle East Club  in Cambridge, Mass. Joy. After a night at Chez Jomo, it was off to Boston to prepare for the apex of our now week long rock-a-thon.  ...  I've never rocked harder in my whole life - ever.  Best damn rock show period.  I am not leaving Boston.    We showed up for a 7pm sound check at 6:15 or so and, surprise, 7pm came and we weren't up for a sound check. 7:45ish we finally hit the stage for a soundcheck and we learn something pretty valuable about ourselves right away. We're damn loud. Christ. The sound guy had a face on that looked like he had seen pictures of his mother pleasuring herself with his toothbrush. After s rough few minutes, we worked out a fairly decent sound and hopped of stage. The opening band never showed up [awesome] and so we were pushed up on the list. That was fine... except 9pm came around and the house was still empty. Not... one... guest... period.  [gulp]  9:30? - Same deal and, according to the sound guy [and our original playing slot] we had to go on at 9:40... though neither the band nor the club staff were cool with the idea.  Whatever.  The band, undaunted, headed outside and tried to drum up an audience. We broke out into an improvised a capella medlely of all our songs and got a fair amount of onlookers/temporary fans but not a single person went into the club. [damn it!]. We still were in high spirits and decided to head in and play anyway - empty house be damned.  [If you rock out, they will come]  People immediatly began coming in the instant we began our set. How 'bout that, eh? The house actually got quite full and, damn it, the crowd was digging us. The even started singing along! And the band? We rocked harder than a priest at a boyscout camp.  [word]  You had to have been there - I won't waste your time trying to describe it to you. Suffice it to say it was one of the best shows of my life to date. I'm STILL buzzing from that show.  And this week?  Well... job hunting - I'm at the end of my cash [surprise] and have no real immediate prospects of getting more for a while so it's time to buckle down and brace for missing a meal or two. So be it! - All for the love of the city.  When I'm a rockstar, I won't ever have these problems...   [ Z  Z   Z  Z Z  rockstar ...]",male,24,Internet,Aries,0
378519,1510754,2004-08-06,"I know... I know...  I'm getting worse. Almost 2 whole weeks without an update.  There's just so much going on lately...  [fade to apt. interior 12 days prior]  Immediatly following the  urlLink T.T. Bear's gig , I went over to Goodchild's place [ urlLink see cast of characters ] and well... we got rocked. We spoke of many things. Nobody was hurt. I stumbled from Goodchild's several hours later sometime after midnight through the alley behind his apartment leaving my trombone behind. The world was a giant Labyrinth puzzle and I was the steel ball.  I slept like a pre-op heart patient.  The following week was quite the blur. We were so excited about what had gone down at T.T.'s and were ready to play again - possibly another impromtu concert in Harvard Square. Our forces were divided, however. Over the course of that week at some point, Tom was in New Hampshire, Mike was in New York, Dave was in New York, Sean was in Maine, Jomo was [insert destination], and I was in my apartment. Being relatively isolated gave me plenty of time to rework a number of things on the  urlLink Frankpipe website ... which, of course, I did.  I can see some of you thanking me for not updating this blog during that time and, well, you're weclome. It was a tedious and personally exciting time but I doubt I could manage to convery that what with my clumsy command of the language.  But trust me... it was awesome :)  So that was it during that week... and then the weekend came.  [feet shuffling]  umm... I had a date.  [covering ears]  I can hear all my gal pals shrieking and cheering and whatnot. Please - it's not that big a deal. I prefer not to talk about it here - ask me over IM or in person. It was nice. And yes, Em, I managed to keep all of my clothes on AND I kept my hands to myself - lol. Anyway, as soon as I got back from the date, Henry was here.  Henry is a HUGE italian guy I met at a bar in Hartford some years back. Good friend of mine and, thankfully, most of the time, he's working. I mean literally  most of the time  - a 16-20 day is no big deal to him - construction work is to Henry as music is to Drew. But when he's finally free for a day or two, he wants to party. And it always [always!] means danger for me. This time he showed up at my door with a little black bag and a six beer headstart. I sucked it up, threw his bag in my apt, and we headed out to cause trouble.  I was reminded of my early days at UConn and Shag.  It's important to put Henry's size into perspective. 6'5"" 250 or so... solid muscle vs my 5'11"" 150 wirey geek frame . Oh... and he expects me to keep up shot for shot and beer for beer. Which is, and always will be, a formula for trouble.  So off we go... and I can tell you for sure that we started off at  urlLink Dick's Last Resort .  [note: for those of you who experienced the 'magic' with me in that wonderful San Antonio bar, I'd like to say that, yes, there is one in Boston and, yes, it's just as awesome - join me!]  After that, things get hazy. I did, however, learn 3 things...  ...unfortunatlly I can only recall the most important one:   Never give Henry tequilla.   I can here some of you laughing. I've heard similar decrees given by other folk but this is the very first time I've seen it pan out to something... well just plain dangerous.  Since we first started hanging out, he and all the people who knew him got all kinds of quiet when the word ""tequilla"" was mentioned. I thought it was all dramatic bullshit to be honest. Nobody really wanted to talk about it but they  insisted  that I not give him tequilla.  I didn't listen. In fact, he had about 4 shots thanks to me...  ...ummm I'm pretty sure he punched a guy out.  We fled the scene and grabbed a cab to some other place that was not my home [?]. We walked from that place to my apartment whereupon Henry collapsed on my bed.  Great.  I stole my blankets, curled up on the couch, and was asleep in seconds.  The morning came and, per usual, I was up at the crack of dawn. After checking my mail, brushing my teeth and washing my face, I drop kicked Henry and we headed off to The Pour House on Boylston for the best breakfast on earth. Seriously. The prices are wicked cheap [$4 for french toast and sasuage] and the food is excellent. Stuffed, we headed back to the apartment and [shock and surprise] Henry was alseep  again  in less than 10 min [Hungover much?]. About 3 hours later, he got up, packed his things, and headed off to a job in Attleboro or some place.  Good times.  I spent the rest of the day sleeping in my bed. I don't know what the hell I was trying to prove but it felt damn good.  The next day, things started happening all at once.  Over the course of this week, we [Frankpipe] got a number of emails and IM's from fans in Washington State. Apparently we have a whole lot of fans out there. Seriously. They want us to come out there to do a show. We're considering a roadtrip.  The band all came back to Boston - well except Tom who is still in CT with family. We've met in different chunks and worked on some new music here and there. Mike has written 4 new songs [jesus]. Goodchild and I are collaborating on one.  Pictures from 2 of our last 3 gigs [Farmer's Market (Hartford, CT) and T.T. The Bear's Place (Cambridge, MA)] came in. The T.T.'s shots were a little dark and tough to make use of but the Farmer's Market shots were excellent. They're  urlLink posted here on our website .  This weekend's show at  urlLink Donstock  was confirmed. Nick Amodio's band  urlLink Pachadio  may be playing as well. $4 people - IM me for more details.  I updated the crap out of the website - please,  urlLink sign up for the mailing list . Really. You'll know all there is to know as soon as we do. Plus there will be chances to win free crap! Sweet! Pictures, video, and mp3's abound.  urlLink Check it out .  That's been my week. Web geekery, Frankpipery, and such.   I hope I never leave this town.  This summer is almost over and the reality of  home v boston  is starting to sink in. In my heart I've made my choice and now, I guess, it's time to start making real life preperations.  We'll see what comes of all of this. Either way it's been a helluva ride thus far, eh? :)  And Hey! Don't be afraid to drop an IM or an email from time to time gang. I miss you guys.

391165,1190695,2004-05-24,"Let's just say I hardly expected to be talking about religion (not matter how indirectly) on my second entry, but such is the world we live in. To set the stage, I'd like to entertain you with a little anecdote:  So the greatest guy in the world - for ambiguity's sake, let's call him ""Adrian"" - is playing Counter-Strike online one Victoria Day afternoon when a certain individual - who, for ambiguity's sake, we will call ""Priscilla"" - hiding behind the anonymity of the Internet, signs onto the server Adrian is playing in and changes his screenname to ""i fight for allah"". Adrian, being such a smart guy, corrects Priscilla, saying Allah is, in fact, spelt with a capital 'A'. To which Priscilla responds, ""allah is not my god, so i choose not to capitalize it."" Adrian is struck upside the head by this comment, and as a result, ceases to refer to himself in the third-person.  Yes, folks, believe it or not, ""Allah"" is a proper noun, and as such should be spelt with a capital 'A'. Priscilla's comment is the equivalent of saying ""George Bush isn't my president, so I'm not going to capitalize his name"" or ""I don't drive a Ford, so from now on it will be known as 'mustang'"".   Even so, the word ""Allah"" isn't specific to Islam; it's the Arabic word for ""God"". Even Arabic Christians and Jews call God ""Allah"". So, unless Priscilla does not believe in any higher being, Allah  is  technically Priscilla's god.  Ah, but what can one do? Much to my chagrin, I can't spend more than thirty seconds online without coming across this sort of garbage. As a result, I try not to talk much while playing Counter-Strike.  So what does our petulant protagonist do? He proceeds to make Priscilla eat hot lead, four rounds straight. Doesn't that make you feel all warm and fuzzy inside?  The End.",male,16,Student,Virgo,0
391166,1190695,2004-05-22,"Yes, this is it. Much to the delight of all connected to the Internet, if not the world, I have decided to start my very own online blog. There shall be rejoicing in the streets! Drinks are on me.  Sarcasm aside, I feel this will be an interesting experience. It's hard to pinpoint my reasons for choosing to publishing my deepest, most personal thoughts only for the world to see. The man living in my right auditory canal, but we'll leave that subject alone for the time being. No, let's focus on a couple succinct, less personal reasons:  1) Being a self-professed geek and technophile, I figure I should have some semblance of a web site, lest my PDA reject my body and eat its way through my pocket, thereby ruining a perfectly good pair of pants. In my history online, I have started exactly three personal web sites, and have finished exactly zero. Let us pray this one will live long enough to catch interest in online communities, making yours truly an Internet sensation overnight. One can dream.  2) A few of my good friends, both online and in that frightening void know as the Real World, have similar online journals. I have yet to come across a trend more worthy of my endorsement.  3) My mind is a raging sea of useless knowledge and half-finished thoughts. Hear that gurgling sound? Could just be the three-day-old leftover Kentucky Fried Chicken using my stomach as a medium to communicate with the living world, but let's not go there. Anyway, I feel I should have a place to write down some of the things that spew forth from my cerebral cortex on an hourly basis.  4) Being at the height of my teenage years, I feel it may be time to indulge in a little navel-gazing and soul-searching. Therefore, during the lifespan of this blog, I will successfully deduce no less than the answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything. You can take my word for it.  Having seen this, I'm guessing that this blog will end up being some odd combination of  urlLink Slashdot  and  The Catcher in the Rye . Nevertheless, a good time will be had by all. I hope I will be able to find the time to stop by and update regularly.  I can see that nearly an hour has passed since I started this composition.

391168,1190695,2004-06-08,"I'm in the process of discovering that it's  really  not easy to find time to update this blog. It seems that new posts have become a weekly occurrence. Hopefully once exams are over in a couple of weeks I'll be able to get on here more frequently. In the meantime, let's go over the past week, in insufferable detail, replete with witty idioms and colloquialisms! I'm quivering just thinking about it!   Wednesday:  Uh, Wednesday. Wednesday... Hmmmm. Must not have been an overly interesting day if I can't remember a thing about it. According to my PDA, I had a math test and the last day of my Accounting summative, but I'll be damned if I can remember. I  do  know my team managed to blow the two-goal lead we had going into the second half. End result: 2-2. No, I didn't score, but at least I didn't have to rip a loose flap of skin off my heel again. Moving on...   Thursday:  Thursday was quite an eventful day, comparatively. My mom finally dragged me across town to the licencing center to get my G1 (""learner's permit"", to all the less enlightened out there). Some forms, an eye test, and 40 multiple-choice questions later, and I can now drive! I'm free as a bird! A bird who has to fly with 0.0% blood-alcohol level, an adult with at least four-years flying experience in the passenger seat, an only between one half-hour before sunrise to one half-hour after sunset. But I digress.  It's not that I don't  want  to drive. It's just that I have no  motivation  to start. I'm not going to have my own car, or have regular access to one, and as soon as I pass my road test, I'll be relegated to the position of ""taxi driver"" for my little sister. Add $600 for driver's ed. and the early onset of grey hair thanks to having to drive with my dad, and the whole thing just didn't seem worth it. Ah, well, things are now in motion.  After working at the library from 3:30-5:30, I got  the  best exercise I've had in months. Certainly felt like it anyway. It seems the Powers That Be decided to have me referee a 14-year-old boys' game way up at Notre Dame High School in north Burlington. Of course, my dad is out of town, and my mom has to work, leaving me stuck with a bicycle as my only means of transportation to said game. Of course, the route I have to take it  uphill , into a headwind, for about 2km. Needless to say, I was puttering along on my grannie gear for most of the trip. Truth be told, though, I'm not in the best shape. On the other hand, coming home was a blast: I'm sure I hit a good 50 clicks going downhill.   Friday:  Friday, hmmmm... Friday. A lot like Wednesday. Got my math test back (aced it), did a Cisco practical exam (aced it), had to work at the soccer club from 6-9. That's just about it.   Saturday:  Six hour shifts at the soccer club are  not  fun. Especially now that the season has started and there's really nothing to do but surf the Internet, random odd job exclusive. So after working 9-3 I came home and... slept? Did homework? Played  Morrowind  for four hours? Your guess is as good as mine. This is why I need to update more often.   Sunday:  Sunday morning I got up and no one was home. It was a nice day, so I went for a walk... and bought a new  urlLink mouse . It was on sale, what can I say? This is why I shouldn't go for walks very often: I always end up buying something. I highly recommend the mouse, by the way.   Monday:  Let's run through this quickly - My Computer Engineering class managed to talk my teacher into letting us write our summative test on Wednesday instead. I say to them, why bother? You're not going to be ready then, either.  - Learned about alkenes in Chemistry. Whee!  - Hung around in Physics class longer than I had to. Double whee!  - Worked at the library 6-9  - Came home and watched the Flames lose the Stanley Cup. While studying for a Cisco exam. Right, ""studying"".   Tuesday:  That's today, so hopefully I'll be able to remember  something . Wrote my Cisco exam, and got 85%. Pretty good, considering it was on chapters 1-14, and we've only covered 1-8. During lunch I crammed for the Computer Science summative test I had to write last period. After getting out of Accounting early, I went down to the cafeteria to pick up my yearbook, sign a couple others, and participate in some rousing games of euchre. Math class consisted of more yearbooks signing. What do you expect for the second-last day of school? Anyway, the Comp. Sci. test was a breeze, so I was able to go home a bit early.

(bacteria) in a microscope, but their DNA and chemistry is different, can't remember what they are called though. Well, at least he made it sound a bit interesting, despite it being single celled critters....  I also talked to Mette, who besides climbing also horseback rides and dives. I tried talking her into starting on our Tuesday team. Well, she might not have time/money, but hopefully she will come by and see how  urlLink Mattsson  is.   So now I better start today's work, and get something read about the X-window system!",female,25,Engineering,Libra,1

And Eastern Europe...       urlLink Make your own map!   Otherwise, today I tried to cook some Thai food at home, and it went reasonably well, I just want a gas stove...   Still a bit tired and jetlagged, but not much. Will probably go play AC2, instead of trying to study.  But I did get something done at DTU today, I got my internet on Linux, and I got a webcam installed. Go me!",female,25,Engineering,Libra,1
394213,2422596,2004-02-13,"yeah, yeah, I'll try to write again. We're back form holiday, and I really wish we weren't, since its too cold here. But right now I'm at DTU, trying to get started with our project, but I'm waiting for Kristine, to know what she has found out. And I cannot connect to the internet with my Linux, but I'm going to set it up now, and see if I can get it to behave in a way I like.  I also went and checked the course in Network Security I'm taking, it looks good, but I need to get the book.",female,25,Engineering,Libra,1
394214,2422596,2004-03-31,"Yesterday, I went riding as usual. Mekur had been out on a trip in the forest, so he was in high spirits... At first it was nice, because I could use his energy productively, and I got him rounded well. But he was also kinda angry at the other horses, a bit annoying, and in the last part of the lesson I simply couldn't control him good enough. To do that you have to keep him forward all the time, and it can be a bit hard. You really also have to have nerves of steel and not panic when he gets into attack mode, and just ride him.  Didn't work 100%, but I'm sure a lot better than I was 3 months ago, and that's the important part. (right? - please!)  We went and saw two films at the night film festival yesterday too:  Killer Clans  Yet another Shaw Brothers movie. The best so far I think. It was about warring clans, Mafia like, I think. Then of cause had killers, and everyone was trying to get everyone else.  The good guys and the bad guys got intermixed, lots of plots twists, sneaky aha's and old men that never can be taken down! Oh, and romance too, and the theme seemed to be that you really cannot buy love or true loyalty. Lots of funny and great fighting too.   Golden Chicken  This one was a more contemporary Hong Kong movie. It was about a Hong Kong hooker, and we get to know her life story, starting in the 70's with golden times and lots of money, moving through time and crisises (how the hell do I plural crisis?), involving lovestories, divine intervention and such. A very funny, very well written and plotted movie, and very sweet too.",female,25,Engineering,Libra,1
394215,2422596,2004-03-29,"Well,   urlLink Susan  went competing at our rding club this weekend. And she won one dressage class, and got 3rd place in another on Saturday, so that was great. She jumped on James Sunday, except James didn't jump, he walked... hmmm...  Well; I was helping out both Saturday and Sunday it was very nice.  And now I have promised a lot of people that I am going to enter the next competition in May... Oh no! Well, I should be able to, and I don't aim for winning, just being there without panicking totally (which probably will be a good thing if I'm taking Mekur, since he can get hot tempered...). Oh, and dressage only, of cause!!",female,25,Engineering,Libra,1
394216,2422596,2004-03-28,"[Backdated] Saw two more movies this evening, both from the Shaw Brothers:   Intimate Confessions of a Chinese Courtesan  This was a movie about  a young girl that gets abducted to a brothel. A luxury one, but nevertheless. She fights it, then gives in to the owner, another woman, who is in love with her. Well, they can fight of cause. A lot of jumping, fluttering skirts in fighting women, betrayal, revenge and killing by plunging your hand into people.  Both women had some fantastic half-smile, chuckle, humppf, when someone underestimated them... Very funny I thought. Oh and naked breasts!! Well, the movie was quite old, from the 70's I guess... Oh, and I can definitely see where movies like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (or was it the other way around?) and Kill Bill gets their inspiration from. And probably countless of Hong Kong movies that came after.   The 36th Chamber of Shaolin   Another fighting movie, this one was more straight (in both senses of the word.. ta-da ok, bad joke). About a young man that wants to learn Shaolin Kung-fu to fight the invaders. The Shaolin monks don't meddle in worldly affairs, but he becomes monk, and later goes back to defeat the bad guys. He also succeeds in making the Shaolin teach Kung-fu to the common man.  A lot about his training, a little bit too much fight, fight, fight to my taste, could have used a romance, or plot twist. But very pure, definitely a genre definer.   Great to see those old films, can see why they had great influence. Going to see another one on Tuesday.",female,25,Engineering,Libra,1
394217,2422596,2004-03-26,"[backdated] Saw two films this day:    Baytong  An excellent Thai movie. It is a bout a monk, whose sister dies in a train terrorist bombing. He then have to leave his secluded frost monastery and take care of his 5-8 years old niece. This leads to him becoming acquainted with both disco and hit dancing, bicycling, love, Islam and loss. Both funny and serious, with comments to the religious conflict in Southern Thailand. Especially good when you have been in Thailand, of cause.    The Last Days of the Universe (Universets Sidste Dage)  Another film taking place in Thailand, but about a Japanese guy. We thought it was an action movie with a dash of comedy, but it was really a more quiet subtle movie. Don't know witch genre I would place it in. It was really good actually, when I think back at it, but initially a bit disappointing since we expected something else.  And we were too tired to watch that type of movie.  It will come up later in cinemas here, and if you would like some quiet weirdness, go see it.",female,25,Engineering,Libra,1

394219,2422596,2004-03-10,"Ok, it has been a while... So:   My riding:  I have had 2 wonderful lessons the last week. I really fell I have some progress, I can get Mekur to trot with some energy now. Yeah! Also, I have finally gathered courage to canter on him, and it is OK. Last Tuesday I had some trouble doing it on the right hand (volte?),  and I still loose my outside stirrup somatic, but at least I dare to do it now :). Also, I really feel I have to pull him around in canter, he does not have the energy I feel he has in the trot. But I can practice that. Tomorrow I have a single lesson with Mai, and I look really forward to that.  Tonight is the annual meeting (general forsamling) in my riding club ( urlLink Mattsson ), and I am planning to try to get a position on the board. I think that the riding school riders should be more involved in the club, and this is my way of doing that.  Now I hope they want me.   My new computer:  Is really, really great. Asherons Call 2 looks so much better now. And I really love that game, it still has hours of fun for me. And a really great bunch of people I play with, my ally The Awakening.  Even tough one of the really nice guys quit :(.  Otherwise, I have now tired Star Wars Galaxies, and while it is really nice to play with my old Diablo 2 buddy Steve again, I don't find the game that entertaining. I'm giving it a try still, though.    Our thesis:  Still working at code for motion detection, but on pause as I am trying to write some theory right now. And to fiddle with Latex... But everything still looks good, I think we have a high probability of getting something to work.    Otherwise:  The World Championships in figure skating is this week, so I watch a lot of TV. Eventhough my favorite icedances have gone pro :( No more  urlLink Marina Anissina and Gwendal Peizerat , or the Russian couple. Good riddance to the Italian one they always competed with, though!

394222,2422596,2004-03-09,"So, today I went riding this morning. Mekur as usual, and it went really well. I think I could get much more energy into him than usual, yay! Also, I got some really nice feedback form Sarah (our instructor), and I think I figured out how to get him rounded a bit nicer. A bit. Well, I'm getting better all the time!  Otherwise, I have been looking at thread in C, and interesting things like cleaning up after threads that ends and such. I miss Java.   This evening I was to Golden Z Club meeting, it is a youth club under Zonta ( urlLink zonta.org ,  urlLink zonta.dk ). Zonta is a organization for women in leading or independent positions in business, and works to advance the status of women. The youth club is for university students or just graduates, that aspire to be leaders one day. I don't know about the leadership part, but who knows. I like the part of supporting women, especially women in business, and I think there is a lot to be done in that area. We are building the club to be a professional network, and also we have a 'normal' Zonta club, Zonta Roskilde as sponsors, and we are going to have a mentor agreement with them, that will be really interesting.   Today we had our annual meeting, where we discuss bylaws and such, but this was some very interesting discussions, as the club only started in November. We have a lot to figure out what and how to do.   Also, there are some really nice people, only one that annoyed me a bit, but she did have some good points that I agreed with . Just not the presentation...  Next Friday we will have a party to celebrate the foundation of the club, that will be great.",female,25,Engineering,Libra,1

Otherwise, today I progressed on my C programming for our thesis. Got two programs to communicate using named pipes. Not that difficult, actually, you just have to figure out how it works, and wrap your mind around the antiquity that is C. Really I don't like that backward language. First of all I'm too used to thinking object oriented, and even with a very simple 15 line program, you can feel that C is not thought that way.  And then I am also used to Java, where everything might not be efficeint, but the way things are done are more aestethically pleasing (you don't use a file open function to open a byte stream, for instance).  And worring about memory allocation and freeing also seems so old fashioned...  Oh, well, but it can get the things done, and has a library to communicate with an X-window server, which is why we use the language.",female,25,Engineering,Libra,1
394226,2422596,2004-03-01,"So, this is a meme thing from the  urlLink livejournal  community, but I got it off  urlLink Susan's blog .     Instructions:  1. Copy this whole list into your journal.  2. Bold the things that you have in common with me. If you don't know how to make something bold, I dunno, put asterisks around it or something.  3. Whatever you don't bold, replace with things about you. Take note, ALL 100 are about me, the bold ones I have in common with Susan, where I got the list. You bold what you have in common with me then make up new things about YOU for the rest. You can make the non-bold things somehow related to the things I had in that place,which is what I did, or just make something up, as you prefer.    Well, I don't have a comment system, but if I know you you can tell me you did it. And I don't really know anyone besides Susan who read this and would do it, anyways... I have added my own comments to the list items, also to those I have removed, in parentheses.    01. I tend to be too neglectant of my aquarium. (was: I tend to drink too little during the day.

My mother and I have had more ups than downs.    07.There are some things I would possibly go back and change, but if I did, my whole life would be different. I'm not sure if I want that.

I like to spend small sections of time by myself but most of the time I like my family around me.  (In doubt about this one. I actually enjoy being on my own sometimes, but I like being around my family as well...)   18. I love shopping, but hate shopping for something specific and not being able to find it    19. I want to travel (most of) the world.   20. I like to get up early, if I need to get things done.  (Was: I am definitely a type-B personality (get up late, go to bed late).

Well, half of my cousins anyways....)  29. If I am in doubt about whether or not I can get a job done, I rather not start.  (Was: I'm a perfectionist in things that are important to me (riding f.ex.). Well, I'm not a perfectionist as such, I just dont like a half finished job)   30. I don't hesitate to give up on a book, or shelve it to try again later, if I am not drawn into it in the first 50-100 pages.  (or halfway through it...)   31. I can't sleep without a pillow - even if it sucks    32. I love baby animals. Like who's going to say, ""Damn, kittens suck!???""     33. I have no use for pretentious people.   34. I believe the future will be a great place to live. (I really do. I have faith in mankind, and maybe a bit naively so, but I think technology and evolution (of the society and mind) will bring us a brilliant future.  Was: I think I'd rather live in the past than in the future. Oh no, not as a women. And who really wants to die from an infected wound??)   35. I believe in the Oxford English Dictionary.

I hate people who insist on doing things the hard way, even after I've politely explained the easy way    41. I really enjoy thoughtful gifts, even if they cost nothing.    42. I love to make people laugh and smile. (who doesn't? 'I am the evil super villain, and I love to make people cry'?)   43. I cannot imagine living without a pet   44. I can imagine living apart from my husband for any amount of time ( - but that doesn't mean I will like it. I can imagine we will need to, due to career issues at some point.  Was: I cannot imagine living apart from my husband for any amount of time)   45. Patience is something I need to work on, but I'm trying. at least I try sometimes   46. I do like coleslaw, but only certain types/recipes.  (Was: I don't like coleslaw - but I do like the thought of coleslaw)   47. I love a good burger   48. I've never seen an episode of the Sopranos or West Wing.  (Was: I've never seen an episode of the Sopranos or Langt fra Las Vegas.)  49. I am very happy with the place I live - in general.

I possess an above-average I.Q.    54. I have a tendencyto be late for appointments.

I have never tried a candlelight bath, but it sounds wonderful.    73. I cannot survive without internet access.   74. I have become quite good to say no to responsibilities I in reality don't want. (Years of expereince in volunteer organisations paying off.  Was: I haven't yet learned to say no, but I'm trying.)  75. I am good at presenting my opinions in a discussion (see above...  Was: When confronted, I'll debate and argue, but I get all trembly. I do much better at this sort of thing via email than in person.)   76. I love snuggling with my husband. Both when it does and when it doesn't lead to more.    77. I own one pair of scratched sunglasses. actually several - and maybe a pair that isn't scratched up too bad  (do I have an unscrached pair??)   78. My bra and panties almost never match.     79. I'd rather have a man with less body hair than more  (but I rather have he keeps the hair he has than wax...)  80. I'm a geek - but cute one.

Was: I know what LaTeX is, but don't consider myself a geek (I am married to one, tho))  81. If I exercised a lot, I would probably loose weight.  (Was: My weight is pretty stable no matter how I eat, exercise etc.)   82. My boobs are natural.    83.

The only thing I know I am allergic to is nickel.  (Was: I'm allergic to cats)  85. I hate flying. The only good thing about it is that it takes 10 hours to get somewhere it would take a month to get to by train or car.  (Was: I love to fly. it's take-off and landing that gets me. Still true about the landing and takeoff though. It took a week for right ear to become normal after we came home from Thailand)    86. I daydream sometimes.    87.

I am not very good at keeping anything up for appearences sake. (Not always a good thing; to yell at someone in the middle of the street...  Was: Noisy eating really annoys me. It only annnoys me if it is very bad, but then my husband says I have terrible table manners...)   91. I am easily amused. on occassion very easily    92.

I have so much in common with Susan that it's kinda scary!  (Well, actually it is not scary at all :)    As far as I can count, 75% in common. Not surprising, really....",female,25,Engineering,Libra,1
394227,2422596,2004-04-28,"So, Saturday we got back from Tisvilde.  The apartment was sort of dusty in the kitchen and hallway, but behind the taped doors it was OK. It is really weird to have all the stuff we usually have in the kitchen standing in the living room.  The bathroom was bare.  Really bare concrete, the floor broken up down to the iron supporting things (lÃ¦gter) that needs to be protected.  Looks so strange. I must remember to take a picture.  They had also removed the toilet, so now we have no bath, no toilet. Luckily there is a toilet in the backyard, but still... They also put up a shower in the cellar.  We decided to keep the cats confined to my room and the living room, as there was holes in the floor in the bathroom, down to the cellar below.   Monday I stayed home to talk to the bricklayer guy, and he was really nice, and we talked about how we wanted the bathroom.   Tuesday, we should get new (512K yeah!) internet, part of Christians work benefit. So free internet, very nice. But of cause the router didn't work correctly, so I don't have internet. Grrrr. After being away from my internet a week, and now this...  I really wanted to catch for our weekly new-char session in AC2 on Wednesday, but now it seems like I will miss it today as well. Grrr. Really.   Oh well, we also went and saw Kill Bill vol. 2 last night, and it was really good. A lot more backstory is revealed, and it is much more interesting than vol. 1. But still as cool.   Other than that, e-mailed with  urlLink Marshal  , who now have a blog up and running on his site.

Susan sent me some of the pictures of me that Jonas took the other Friday, when we had a lesson. He took it with our camera, but I didn't get around to look at them before we went away.

Here is one where we look happy:  urlLink Me and Mekur   And here you can see Mekur is big horse with nice long legs. And the trot isn't too sloppy:  urlLink Another one   (yes very fast, I didn't reduce them for the internet, but I do not want to figure out how gimp works... and I'm picking up Jakob and Sofie at Lyngby station in 18 minutes...)",female,25,Engineering,Libra,1

I had a riding lesson Fridam together with Susan, and that wa a good way to do it. Joans took a lotof pictures of us riding, very interesting. Also I'm starting to get a little nervous about my promise to enter the club competition in May... I'm not sure I can sit properly in trot with stirrups, and the trot/canter change is still bugging me. And I still get a little bit afraid... Eventhough its much better...  Otherwise, we will be having handymen to fix our bathroom the next 3-4 weeks. We have been cleaningeverytihng out, and did we (mostly me...) have a lot of junk in the closets. Well, not everything is torn down. They will break up the floor the fist week, so we are moving out until saturday. That means no internet at home for a whole week. ARRGGGHHH!!

They told us last Wedneday when we saw them at my parents. I kinda figured it was a possiblity, as they were getting settled and all, but I didn't know it would get me so excited, but I really am. I think its wonderful.  Also, I had a perfect riding lesson Friday, Mekur was in such a good mood, it was great. I got to canter on him, and he even bucked a bit with me when I drove him forward, but I was ok with that. I even cantered after he bucked with me.

We then shopped a bit there, or Christina got a lot of clothes. We didn't see it all, but itwasa very nice. Very light and airy, and nice shops. Lots of sports shops all in one place. Debenhams was smaller than expected, but they had some really cool kitchen and home stuff. Bilka One Stop was Huge!!  Afterwards we went out and ordered our new bathroom furniture at Svane. Wheeew. All decided upon, all done :).Except for a few bits of cause... Then Christian picked up his climbing T-shirts, they looked good. We also hadsomem hot cocoa at BankerÃ¥t. We went home, and went out to Tapasbaren for dinner. We were an hour early, so we went into a winebar to get something to drink. Very nice place with big comfy chairs.   Tapasbaren was very nice. The food was not exceptional, but it was different and nice to try. The best thing was that we drank sherry to the whole dinner, very interesting so different sherries can be. Christian didn't know what he wanted to do afterwards, despite me having zillions of good idea. In the end we went home and played PS2 (Well I played, Christian read).  All in all a great day!!  Yesterday we went to buy a shower [armatur], we found one that looked OK at Silvan. We also got some lights for the ceiling, so the electrician can fix everything when he comes.  We got some paint for the toilet, and I painted yesterday and today. All done :). Christian have been cleaning the kitchen, very, very nice.  I like painting better than cleaning, but even though I can reach the ceiling with my to step ladder, I'm still afraid I'll fall over..Sigh! But I think it will look really great, so nice to finally get rid of that awful colour it was when we moved in!

So I'll try to post some pictures of me and Mekur here. You can see some pictures of Susan at her blog (when it is up again...).  The quality is not so good, some of them were blurry since we were moving, but also I had to size reduce them in GIMP, and I am not that good with that tool. Now I uploaded the pictures to my DTU account, then I might go home and make them a bit nicer.   Here we go; first the starting halt:     Trotting:     And trotting on the circle:     I like the last one, at least I am looking where I want to go, not down on the horse or at the judges.

394237,2422596,2004-05-25,"Firstly, I have updated the Blog layout and such, since Blogger got new templates and new functionality. So far, I like it. (Comments, titles...).  Otherwise, I have installed a wireless network. Or installed the card in my computer, and updated the installation Christian made. Now it's somewhat more secure... I also got the freakiest computer error ever. At some point the internet was unavailable, and I noticed that my IP number had changed to something that was way out of range of the IP numbers our base stations assigns. Ok, I try to fix it and I succeed. I, wrongly, assumed it has something to do with the network setup... Today I got the same error, and after some investigation, I conclude that on playing the old single player game Zeus (a city building game), my IP changes. It's a single player game. It shouldn't have anything to do with my network connections at all! But it does. Bad programming somewhere, I suppose. Luckily restarting my computer fixes it.  So, since I haven't posted in so long time: The bathroom remodeling is actually moving forward, but being with only a toilet in the backyard on the 6th week is a bit annoying. The handymen (or whatever they are really called - it can't be handymen, can it?) are a bit annoying, and we need to figure a lot of things we never thought we had to think about, and it is a bit trying.  Other important stuff: My riding competition. While fun to be at and be part of, I was very, very nervous. So Mekur tricked me, of cause, because he does that... Nothing too bad, but I did finish last. I got ok marks for the stuff he behaved in, so that's great. I will definitely want to compete again, and next time maybe be a little less nervous! But the next competition is the 5th of September, and at that point we are in Canada to Marshal and Eri's wedding celebration, so I won't compete until November...",female,25,Engineering,Libra,1

See, because of our wonderful bathroom remodeling, this is not just the ussual throw things in the washing machine turn up and so forth. No, the water to the washing mashine is cut off, so we have to go to the laundromat. Which also explaines why we barely have any clean clothes (that we want to wear for this summery weather) left. So I packed a back, and went up there. But of cause it was closed, since someone had broken in the night before, and ravaged everything in an attempt to get money I assume. So no clothes washing today...",female,25,Engineering,Libra,1

He really takes some time to get warmed up. I did aome canter-trot transistions and it went ok. I also rode the programme twice, and it wasn't too bad. Ok probably horrible, I'm afraid I don't sit that perfectly on him, and my circles were too small. But I could do it, and  that was the important part. I'm am beginning to look really forward to next Saturday :).  We also were at some friends birthday party (Jakob and Sofie) in HolbÃ¦k. It was really nice, and we were very well treated with respect to food. We went home about half past 12, a longdrive to Copenhagenm but it is kind of nice to wake up in your own bed.   We are still trying to figure out what furniture and sink thingy we should have in our bathroom. I think we want basically the same stuff we had earlier, just nicer quality and looks.

Idealistic, I am. It has been a while since I took part in University politics, but now I can more often see myself being part of city council, or maybe the parliament.   So, what promted me to send the membership application right now? Today I saw a portrait of Magaret Thatcher on television. It was very interesting, also because I was really to young to understand politics, especially foreign politics, at that time. It really inspired me. Not because I agree with Mrs. Thatcher's politics, because I'm quite sure I don't, but I admire her person. She really fought for what she believed was right, and she did it well. She kept on promoting her vision of a better Britain, and I think that is admirable.  I thought to myself, yes, I really do want to make a difference.

He did want to have fun, and was testing me a bit when I started, but then it went really well. I enjoy riding him more and more, and I have even considered trying to strike a deal with Gunilla (daily leader of both the stable and the riding school) and his owner if I could ride a set amount of time each week, only having instruction some of the times.

She has her own consulting company,  urlLink Evolution ApS .  We had a very interesting discussion covering a lot of things, mostly how and why we perceive others as we do, but also about how we interact in social situations and the borders of what is private, personal and public about us.   The main point about the feedback, that both the giver and the receiver should be conscious about what exactly they want/give feedback on. Also when you give feedback, you can only state what you perceived, you cannot tell anything about if the other person is good at what he/she generally does. That is up to the person to decide, based on what several people perceive about them.  We also talked about Jung's shadow theory, that was very interesting: About how the feedback you receive when you are a kid determines what kind of prejudices and 'boxes' you have. It also determines what feelings and behavior you show. Other feelings might be surpressed and are hiding in the shadow. This might not be 'bad' feelings, if your parents didn't want you to laugh loudly, the inclination to do so might hide in your shadow. I would like to read some more about it, but knowing me, I will probably never get around to it :)Â·  All in all a very good meeting, it made me think about some things I don't normally think about, and that is always good.",female,25,Engineering,Libra,1

The only problem I had was Helen, I didn't think she was beautiful enough, not that she was ugly, she was just ordinary good looking, not stunning. Also I didn't think Paris and Helen seemed like they were in love, the spark just missed. I dunno.  Oh, and I admit that Brad Pitt can look good. Yeah...

Always good to talk about computer games, computers in general, studying, beer and more. The problem is that Laust doesn't drink wine, so he had of cause brought beer for us. Since I don't drink much beer, I had brought a bottle of wine with me. I got a nice wheat beer, a bottle of wine... We also went with his neighbours to the common house (in the dorm/apartment place he lives) and got a drink. We played Trivial with his neighbours also, so we weren't home until 4 am. And I was kind of drunk. But a great evening. Oh btw I got a new bike Saturday as well, as my old one is 11 years old. It is great to use.   On Sunday Susan, Corinne (an American woman riding at Mattssons, right after us and also on Mekur) and I went to the Danish Dressage Championships, which took place at Broholm Ridecenter in Fyn. I had to pick up Susan and Corinne at Lyngby station at 9 am. So I only got 4 hours of sleep, and I were a bit tired and hung over...

You can see some very nice pictures, as well as results in  urlLink Susan's Blog .  Wednesday Christian and I went to see Harry Potter and the prisoner of Azkaban.

But very pleasant surprise :). It was very nice and small, only the closest family (those that weren't away on holidays). After the wedding we went to Bjarke and Sisse's house to have brunch. It was a long time since I have seen their house, they had made a lot of improvements, it is going to be so nice. The brunch was great, they had made some really delicious things, like home made Nutella! We also went for a short walk to the beach, as the weather was actually quite nice yesterday :).

418930,3351952,2004-05-19,"So, I need to improve my self-esteem.  The thing is, I don't think I have a poor image of myself at all.  I like myself.  Hey, I'm my best friend.  I know that I'm a smart person, I think I'm pretty (most of the time, sometimes you just have those days where you don't like any of your clothes or you can't get your hair done right, but we all have those), I like my body.  I have a little belly pudge, but I think just about the right amount.  If I wanted the perfect body, I would reduce the pudge by a little bit, but overall, I look good.  Anyways...  I'm a good person, I usually like everyone, I honestly can't think of a reason someone shouldn't like me.  However, both socially, and since I started grad school, academically, I just act like I have no confidence in myself.  I have a very difficult time conversing with people until I know them really well.  Even some people I've spent a good amount of time with, I just can't be comfortable in their presence.  I don't know why this is.  I'm constantly worried about what to say, and I just can't hold a normal conversation.  Also academically, which is a big issue lately, I just feel like I haven't accomplished anything in lab.  And I worry that I'm not going about my project right, and I flip out and get super nervous when I have to give presentations, to the point that I give myself diarrhea.  (Woohoo, doesn't everyone want to know all about that?!)  Ever since I got here, I just don't have faith in myself that I am going to succeed.  In college, I was really good at my major.  I didn't particularly like the field, but I got a certain amount of satisfaction from problem solving doing homework, and doing well on a test.  Even when I had to study my brains out, thinking how am I ever going to figure this out, I always did, and did well on the tests.  Here, I started out in a new field, and in the coursework first year I felt a little disadvantaged from not having all the background as it seemed like everyone else had.  But I pulled through, passed everything.  But at every step here I feel like I'm one step behind everyone else or where I should be.  You don't get the satisfaction of a test grade in research telling you that you're at least on track.  Everytime I ask people questions about my work, I feel like I'm bothering them.  When I meet with my advisor, I always feel like he expects more than what I've got.  And that he expects me to work harder and put in more hours than I am.  I would work around the clock, but sometimes I just don't know what to do. Or I have to wait for stuff I ordered to come in.  Or wait to hear back from the tech support people.  It's soo frustrating.  Anyways, I just need to plow through.  But I want to be able to feel better about it.  I really do like what I'm doing.  I just don't like feeling like a complete failure.   Anyways, as for the social problems, I've decided a lot of it is because I just hang out with people who I know through school.  Those are the only people I know in Baltimore.  So school always comes up.  Maybe I'm just intimidated because I feel like everyone else knows so much more than I do.  But hell, I'm here to learn.  And I am learning.  So why should that bother me?   I just can't relax around anyone.  I need to meet other people, but I have no idea how.  I have always had my ""little buddy"", who is whoever my closest friend is at that time in my life, who you go to parties with, meet new people with, and you can relax around new people because that person is there, and knows who you are.  But I don't have that here.  I need to learn how to get over it, relax, and just go meet some new people.  But again, where?  It's not like I can just saunter into a random bar/coffee shop/wherever, and be like ""hey, anyone in here looking for a new pal?""  I got a part-time job, thinking it would help me meet people, and I met people, who I now see at that job, but no one to actually hang out with.  It's hard trying to make friends with girls even, because you feel like you're a guy hitting on them when you're like ""hey, we should hang out sometime.""  Anyways, I need a new plan.  I've got to change something.",female,24,Science,Scorpio,1
418931,3351952,2004-06-02,"This is what I have been doing for the past 3 years.  Well, at least the past 1 year certainly.  I took my oral exam at the end of May last year, and since then, I have just been doing lab work.  And I have accomplished pretty much nothing.  I do have more of an idea of what I want to do, but you'd think after 1 year of work, I would actually have acquired some concrete information.  However, I have not.  I have nothing.  Zero.  Zilch.  If I don't get something done this summer, I will have exactly the same poster as I did last year.  I think in that case I wouldn't put it up because it would be so pathetic.   The thing is, I don't understand how this is happening, and what I am doing wrong.  I really do try to work hard.  I just get stuck on these stupid problems that I'm sure nobody else is having.  For instance, I've been trying to get a real-time PCR assay going since about January.  Finally it looked like my primers were good, I had a kit and a protocol that worked, but oh, suddenly, I can't get my RNA isolated correctly.  Either it's not dissolving, or I have protein contamination.  Yes, having this problem might be acceptable, but not being able to fix it for 3 weeks is not.  This is my life.  One stupid problem after another that I can't figure out what in the world I'm doing wrong.   When you feel like a complete failure all the time, it's really hard to motivate yourself to keep coming in and keeping your pace up.  Because really, if I'm not going to get anything done, I might as well have a clean house, or be well rested, or getting plenty of exercise.  You'd think.   It makes me want just chuck it and start over with something else.  Get a job.  Do something and be successful.  But I don't want to give up and quit.  I have to make this work.  So maybe I'll write another post this time next year and I'll have my assay working.",female,24,Science,Scorpio,1
421478,3952922,2004-08-17,"Movers & Shakers - The Typical Karachi Gig  By Saphiya Khan      Email this article   Roadside Romeos, classy chicks, smoke from the mouths of I-m-a-chain-smoker guys, girls clad in trademark crisp white cotton shalwars and duppattas, million kinds of ring tones in an effort just to show offs their new Nokia 8910 (while no one is on the other end of the line), a bit of maa behen ki gaaliyaan, with a sprinkle of head banging and some booty shakingâ¦ and youâve got a Karachi concert.  The Bahria gig that took place on the 9th of April was no different. Arranged by the 'Textile Institute of Pakistanâ, the concert featured Mizmaar (a.k.a. NOT Mizraab) and Strings. The show started as usual about an hour late, not that I mind as the place was air-conditioned which helped my make-up not get ruined. But the guys sitting behind seemed to mind the delay making loud comments like âAbey buhut hogaya, ab shuru ker"" and the likes.  Killing time wasnât really a problem as I was trying to check out the self proclaimed ""hunks"" and the one in ten fitted-bell-bottom-clad babes. A concert is the best place to see all sorts of such namoonas. Skinny guys wearing sleeveless shirts or Johnny Bravos with broad chests n muscles dressed in two sizes too small shirts. Who ever they were trying to impress was heavily disappointed to say the least.  The wait was definitely worth it as the performance by Mizmaar was pretty darn good. It looked like Danyal Badshah (the vocalist) was high on something. The crowd enjoyed songs like Saday Nal, Tu Jo Merey and Ghalori. Kashan (the guitarist) seemed to be in top form as well. Charlie, of Mizraab, was on drums that night and Russell offered his fair share of kicks with the bass. The sound was unexpectedly amazing and that was all that the crowd needed.  The typical guys gathering in the front of the stage was quite entertaining. Seemed like some of them had 'shake it daddy' playing in their minds. Shakin booties wasnât the only thing that caught the eye, the guys head banging were pretty freaky too.   Strings made their appearance soon after Mizmaarâs exit and the crowd was in awe. This time even the girls didn't try to restrain themselves and hopped in to dance at the front of the stage. Which was, of course, much to the guysâ delight.  The rhythmic claps and one step moves all seemed, well, nice. The wet macho men got some time to catch their breaths and dry their sweats (I am not exactly complaining about the smell but a bit of air freshener would have done some good). The audience hummed all the songs through out and the ones in front danced their heads off to songs like Chhaye Chhaye and Dhaani.  But of course, not all can go so well. After all it is a Karachi concert. Something seemed terribly out of place â it was all too perfect till now. And right then a little fuss was created when the dhakam peel began in the front rows. Our efficient security heroes jumped in and solved the matters by answering swears with swears, pushes with pushes and glares with bigger glares! The fuss soon ended and the heroes left with the 'sub set hai na?' Talk about efficiency.  Despite a few hiccups the gig was a good one. And those of you who missed it, kind of missed a lot. So watch out for your ""not-my-type"" bandsâ¦ they might just be as rocking as the others....and oh, if the guy with the ""unf**k the world"" t-shirt is reading this, I must say that it was a nice way of grabbing attention... *giggle giggle*",male,16,Student,Sagittarius,0
421479,3952922,2004-08-17,"Junoon_____over the years 1991 saw the birth of a new Pakistani band,Junoon.Only this time the birth was different.Junoon wasn't just another band, it was 'the' band. I wouldn't be exaggerating if I called them a 'revolutionary' band. They entered the mainstream at the time when jhankar ruled, hideous rip-offs such as baby-yeah(remember sajjad ali?) were super hits and the word 'rock' was alien to 90% of our population. They are indeed the pioneers of Pakistani rock. While mummy daddies refused to recognize junoon's efforts as 'music', a larger part of the youth embraced junoonism. To them junoon was a passion that became more intense with each album. Although its roots lie in Pakistan, Junoon has enjoyed fame and success all over the world, courtesy the international music channels such as V and MTV that pampered it every now and then. The band was successful enough to create a new genre in Pakistan, the Sufi rock. With music inspired by Jimmy Hendrix, Jeff Black, Led Zeppelin and U2 and lyrics of great mystic poets such as Bulley Shah, Rumi, Ghalib and Iqbal, Junoon created a fusion that rocked the nation. (And a lot of other stuff too*wink*) Junoon's music is not categorized. It covered a wide range of topics in its music, from politics to the rise and fall of the taliban; they spoke up for all in their songs. Their bluntness and boldness added to their charms. They mustered up the guts in the time where media was anything but 'free'. The band began their work in 1990, when it comprised of Ali Azmat as the vocalist,Salman Ahmed the acoustic and electrical guitarist cum back up vocalist and Nusrat Hussain on the bass guitar. Their first album, Junoon, did not manage to hit the skies. It was highly criticized on, which isn't anything out of the blues for a new set up in Pakistan. It takes some time for us to get over the past and move on with something new all the time isn't it? The album Junoon, nonetheless, had some amazing tracks that were recognized in the later years such as Heer, Neend ati nahi and Rangoon main khoya. The negative response did not make Junoon lose all hopes. A year later, after bidding farewell to Nusrat Hussain and welcoming Brian o Connell as the bass guitarist, Junoon came up with their second album 'Talaash', a truck and roll album which funny to think was sponsored by close up. It was Brian's first album but his finesse didn't come until the third album, Inquilaab, released in 1995.Inquilab was no doubt the strongest pillar for Junoon.It proved their strength and rocked the Paki music scene with the smashing hit such as Husan waloon, Khwaab, Heeray and Saeein.Junoon was now a stable hit in Pakistan. In 1996 the cricket world cup saw a rise of a patriotic song ""Jazba Junoon"" that became an instant hit with the already crazed stalker cricket fans. The sales of their album, soared high and now their fan following included people of all ages, not just teeny boppers. The video for their religious devotion based song, Saeen managed to change the opinions of many critics including the country's so-called mullahs. The fifth album came out in 1997.Named Kashmakash, it again hit the top charts but this surely wasn't the best there was to Junoon.The band broke all previous records and entered the international market when their album ""Azadi"" was released. The head banging, typical rock style was so in, it gave all parents the freaks yet nothing could stop the growing fame of Junoon.Songs such as Khudi, Meree awaz sunoo and Yar bina were widely acclaimed and junoon became a household name. Junoon received  appreciation and acknowledgement even from the neighboring India, which was incredible, keeping in view the relations of the two countries at that time. The band won a golden disc for Azaadi at an international music channel awards after sharing the stage with top class international bands such as Pearl Jam, Oasis, Bush and the likes.  Their video for the song ""ehtesaab"" focused on our corrupt politicians and was ,as expected, banned from our local TV stations. The then P.M of Pakistan, Nawaz Sharif, banned the band claiming it was due to the promotion of jeans and long hair in Pakistani culture but it was a widely known fact that the ban was inflicted since Junoon refused to sing for his ""karz utaro mulk sawaro' scheme and did the song ""ehtesaab"" with imran khan instead. The ban did not dampen their spirits, Junoon carried on with their promotion for peace. The band maintained a consistent ethical rectitude. Record sales were the highest for Azadi and it remains to be the king of all albums. The next album Parvaaz was by far superior to anything junoon had ever made. The production was flawless and the album had a complete theme and songs that seem liked they belonged. Plus it had ghoom, the epic. The song that had single-handedly defined junoon's greatness. Too bad the album did not do well in India. That got Junoon wondering what the hell happened and ever since they are clutching to the old fame which is somewhat fading away. The Pakistani music scene has gone much mature in the past 13 years and the audience has a vast choice now. With innumerable bands sailing in the sea, Junoon has a lot more competiton. Their next albums did not carry out the old charm and failed to impress the Junoonis. No wonder there were so many converts from 'junoonism'.Junoon's music now is more commercial than ever and now with the different directions and ali azmat's solo tracks out, there is not much doubt left about the 'stability' of the band. Their latest album deewar was no help to the falling repute and fame of the band, instead it made the fall deeper and with a louder 'thud'. Everything aside, Junoon has made its name written in gold in the Pakistani music history. With over 20 million records selling world wide, the band did play their fair share in making Pakistan proud. Many of us Junoonis have grown up with Junoon's music. It has been a part of us for over 13 years and it is no wonder we feel a sense of loyalty towards the band. We do miss 'our' junoon, the one that lacked commercialism. Every Junooni has a Junoon moment, and in return Junoon has a song for every situation in our life. There is a fondness for Junoon in our hearts for it has been with us for long. Funny how their music inspired us and changed our lives yet we never got to thank them. So here I do it finally, All hail to Junoon, for being what they are and for playing their part in our lives. And of course, for also making us realize there is more to âmusicâ than some do dee daa crap. Junoon rocks!!!",male,16,Student,Sagittarius,0
421480,3952922,2004-08-17,"The Ali Brothers                               Before I began my ""flip-search"" through the channels at mid night, I predicted to myself there would be noori with a doo dee daa song on IM, a few porn movies on the ""night-time-only"" channels my cable wala puts on, some old pushtu movie on UNI TV (wtf?)  And some never ending glamour filled Indian drama on star plus among my options to watch. But never in my wildest dreams did I imagine seeing the ""ali brothers"" on PTV nighttime transmission. *Sigh* Wasnât IM requested and Alizeh's favorite enough???? Why I took the pain to watch them for three full hours, you ask? Well, I couldnât really miss the perfect combination of the guests and hosts. I mean, many of us would dread facing our ex's but doing that on national TV??? Ha ha...that's gotta be interesting...yes, along with Noor and Nadia was the humpy jumpy longhaired beauty (?) Mandana zaidi...for those of you who donât know her.... sheâs the same gal seen in all noori videos.... the one who tries high kicking in ""tum hans diyeyâ. And was recently seen in jawad Ahmed's new song, tak dhina din. Oh and most importantly ,she happens to be his ex too. *sigh* The show started with the three hosts and the two guests striving to make a conversation. Mandana kept her eyes fixed on her hands. Even when she did speak, the words she used were âaap, jee, bolienââ¦ ali noor and ali hamza kept running their hands in their thick hair.... the kind any girl wud kill for. Thank God they arenât 100% girls.... I wud die if any girl besides me had that hair. A while later they acquired a mischievous tone, which didnât fail to produce sly smiles on Mandanaâs face. During the show, a few calls were placed to the Ali brothersâ family and friends and when Mandana called their parents âuncle and auntieâ and they replied with âtumâ, all doubts in my mind were cleared. The show continued with Ali Noor blabbing endlessly. He even dissed Mandana twice. Ali Hamza backed him up with his occasional âHun-Haanâ. He sang his unreleased tracks âMerey kakya kiâ and âgawal mandiâ(thatâs so unfair for BC, ainnit? *winks*) Yawning, I decided to switch the TV off but just then the phone calls were taken on air and finally the âfunâ part was here. There was a usual attack of the noorites at first, who seem to jump out of the receivers. Ali Hamza was receiving loads of requests to sing a song again but Ali Noor (read: the conceited one), sang manwa rey instead. The two even disclosed the fact that the initial plan was to have Ali Noor on the guitars and Ali Hamza on the vocals, which thank God didnât happen! It hurts me to know thereâs still space left for the band to sink lower*sigh*The most frequently asked question was âaap baal kyun nahi katwatey?â, which made Ali Noor get that âwhat-the-hell-is-your-problem?â look on his face. The end was near and yet nothing out of the blues had happened. It got me wondering where all the anti-noorites were? (Oh! And I did try to call in but couldnât get through!) My eyes started to pain since I had already rolled them a gazillion times but the last three callers made it worth it. The conversation was something like: Caller1: Ali jee, my name is Amna .Do you remember me? We have met! Noor: I would know you by face Amna. Caller1: Iâm the same girl who met you in Murreeâs Usmania when you were with                 Anushay .You gave me an autograph on my bill. Noor (*blinks*): Uh, yeah I remember you. (Phone line disconnected) Host: Oh-Ho, disconnect hogayaâ¦ try again. â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦. Caller2: Hey! I wanted to ask Ali Hamza how he came up with his song BC? Whatâs                 story behind it? Mandana (ever-so-eagerly): Jee, your question has been noted down. Iâll soon ask                                                  Hamza. And so she did. Twice (most probably in order to get back at Noor for dissing her). The first time Hamza ignored it slyly. The second time Mandana emphasized and Hamza blinked, looked blank and said,âkaunsa gana?â Talk about lameness! Ali noor barged in and changed the topic and this time Mandana let go. The third caller was the most interesting one. Caller 3: hello, I am blah blah. I have heard that Mandana zaidi and Ali Noor were having an affair. How true is that? (Mandana turns beetroot, Noor smilies, Hamza get an ear-to-ear grin, and the other two hosts have confused looks on their faces) Host: Umm, weâll ask your question .Bye â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦ Needless to say, the question wasnât asked but an uncomfortable feeling did hang in the air. The show ended soon after that and I decided to flip through the channels once more before hitting the sack. The glam-filled dramas were still running on star plus, the pushto movie was about to end on uni tv(or so it seemed), the porn channel was still on and yes, as usual, there was Noori on IM!",male,16,Student,Sagittarius,0
421481,3952922,2004-08-17,"*Paan Ki Dukaan*   ""An all chick band? Pakistani? Uh-Huh.Not possible."" That's the most frequent reaction to PKDâs (Paan ki dukaan) existance. But we swear we exist! Erm, true we don't really qualify for the term ""band"" but you cannot even call us ""not-a-bandâ. I mean we are there, present in the underground music scene and we know we'll never enter the mainstream but heck! We still rock! It all started within one week of the two of us becoming friends. Fanatic as we were about the desi rock scene, it wasn't hard to imagine ourselves as a band. After mustering up all our courage, we kinda gave our mums the 'outline' of what was on our minds and *booooom* Needless to say, we never brought the matter up again. We put our extra-genius brains to work and found a substitute for our dreams. We would make a band, but won't join the mainstream. After all both of us were already bathroom singers and no one seemed to mind that! Once we made the deal final, we were ready to face anything at all that came up. The very next moment we realized we didn't have any instruments nor a penny (yes, stuff was THAT bad). They say necessity is the mother of invention and we couldn't agree more. The idea clicked to Hira, the more creative one among us. We made a guitar (which isn't really as good as a real one but still!!!) out of a shoebox. Amazed? Don't be! All we had to do was make a hole through the side of the box and attach it with thick wood stick and cover the entire thing with three strands of long (real long) rubber band for strings and there! The guitar was ready! Saphiyaâs guitar. Saphiyaâs very own guitar. Homemade, fake but it was a guitar and it was all mine. ALL mine. Ah! Paradise: D Hira is the groovier one and her passion was solely for drums (though saphiya is the one who has a bad bad crush on waqar! *slurp*) The drums weren't a problem. Not at all. What is kitchen equipment for? We turned a plastic chair upside down, inverted two pateelas (read: haandees/thingi you cook food in:/) over the legs of the chairs and we even attached the lids of the pateelas for the 'extra' effect. Drumsticks were obviously spatulas and spoons. There! The ""instrument problem"" was solved. *Sigh* The next issue that came up was our name. We didn't want to sound 'oh-so-sophisticated' by using some French word nor did we want to sound conceited by using our own names (erm, ali noor doesn't get to read this, does he? *blinks*) Since we are desi girls with desi minds and desi music, the name we came up with was as desi as could be. Paan ki dukaan. *Winks*After this was decided, we covered our guitar and drums with shimmering paan wrappers to give the look we wanted and at our all girls' gig that are held at our studio (aka saphiya's storeroom), every person receives the chocolate flavored paans. *Slurp* Our music is not categorised.We'll do any kind. Rock, rap, jazz, Bhangra, pop, metal, punk rock, death metal...name it, we like it. We don't really have any proper songs to our account because we don't have the resources to make them but Yeah we did something which bands like junoon took years to do*evil grin*we ripped a song.'Ripped' is an understatement. We slaughtered the lyrics, scrambled the tune and VIOLA! We had our very own song. Itâs called ""Tu boring ho Gaya hai"", ripped from one of the Uk bhangra bands. Red-hot flaming potato isn't our only inspiration (Doesn't every band like to use that word for the bands they copy? *giggle*giggle*) we adore the commercial advertisementsâ jingles too. We soon plan to make a song called ""paan chahiyey.kaunsa janab?"" *grins*  Frankly speaking, we know we won't ever enter the mainstream but what we want to say here is that girls are capable of almost everything. I mean, we had nothing to back us up. No sources, no support, nothing at all, if we could come up like this, then somebody who has all the resources can work miracles. And we know there are girls with support and resources but they are too shy to come out. When we started we didn't know our next door neighbor would even know we existed but thanks to online forums and orkut, we have gained a little popularity. Weâre even thinking of launching a website in a couple of months (yeah! As soon as we get jobs as dj's on some fm *pouts*) what's better, Faisal Shah even volunteered to model for our 'in-our-dreams' only videos. *Jumps up and down*we might borrow some instruments from our friends and record some covers on our stuck-up computers. The proverb,'where there is a will, thereâs a wayâ, seems to be more meaningful now ainnit? So all you sisters out there go for it if you can. The 'first paki all girlsâ band' label is gone but you can strive to be the second *wink*wink*.And if any parent reads this (which I seriously doubt), please don't underestimate your daughters and back them up like you would do for your sons.

Interestingly, the malfunction was never disclosed to the public until the Miami-Dade Election Reform Coalition, a citizen's group, requested all data from the 2002 gubernatorial primary between Democratic candidates Janet Reno and Bill McBride.

If you own a property in a residential neighborhood (here in  urlLink Lynnwood , anyway) then good luck cutting down one of your trees, regardless that itâs your personal property. One would imagine the impetus behind this kind of local government intrusiveness is a well intentioned but big-brotherly attempt to ensure that trees arenât removed willy-nilly, thereby preserving the suburban woodland texture and ambiance of our corner of Washington.  Leaving aside the competing effect that our numerous shoddy strip malls and trashy trailer parks already have on our pristine wonderland, the best possible argument to remove this restriction is the simple fact that Lynnwoodians at large are hardly itchinâ to break out the chainsaws en masse. If a private citizen wants to remove his privately owned tree, heâs got a good and valid private reason and that should be plenty good enough for the city fathers. By and large, the average homeowner appreciates the beneficial effects that trees have on his property and would only remove one if need be.  Besides, one would imagine that the city fathers would target the prime offenders rather than John Q. Public. Have they never observed the way these pre-fab, cheap-ân-tawdry housing developments are slapped together? They usually go up in the immediate vicinity of longstanding residential neighborhoods populated by owners who are limited with what they may do with their privately owned trees.

Talk about coddling megabuck developers and holding them to a different standard than Joe Sixpack.  When at last the Barbie Playhouse look-alike apartment homes are landscaped, the flora consists of a few juniper shrubs and, of all things, cheap deciduous trees that donât even belong here (and which, to boot, provide all the more breeding ground for the infernal gypsy moth).   Trees in these developments should be replaced with the evergreens that were cleared out to make way for them.

426685,4032740,2004-08-03,"Ah... Baseball, Mom and Apple Pie! Or is that âBallfields, Carlots and Antenna Farms?â  Appearance versus reality. We all come to grips with the difference between the two sooner or later, but the kids of Snohomish County are getting a first-hand lesson earlier than they should have to, along with a primer in sleaze politics, by virtue of their being used as hostages by two of the factions fighting in the desperate, grabassdick fight for cheap land here in Snohomish County.  Basically, it appears that both the North- and South-Snohomish Little League organizations built ballfields on farmland in direct violation of the law. The Seattle Times reported that after a neighbor complained about the traffic and lack of permits, Code Enforcement issued a stop-work order since the fields were plainly illegal--and the very next day, County Councilman Jeff Saxâs office sent an email to the planning department, copying fellow Councilman Kosterâs office, requesting that the stop-work order be lifted so they could get on with the projectâthis despite the fact that the project was, as mentioned, in direct violation of the law.  You have to ask yourself a couple questions. First, what kind of person commits hundreds of thousands of dollars of his Little League organizationâs money to building ballfields that are in flagrant violation of the law? My answer is, âa dumb ass.â Secondly, what kind of councilman actually encourages the illegal construction of ballfields in flagrant violation of the law? My answer is, âa crooked politician with an ulterior motive.â  Bottom line, it appears that Councilman Sax, untroubled by the prospect of using children as pawns and holding them hostage to achieve his political aims, encouraged the Little League organizations to proceed with the illegal construction of the ballfields, allegedly allaying their concerns with promises that the law prohibiting their construction would be changed in Olympiaâand the trusting and well-intentioned (albeit myopic and self-centered) Little League organizations willingly listened to these sweet nothings and went merrily ahead with the construction.  Predictably, the law was, in fact, not changed in Olympiaâthe proposed change having been defeated as it had been defeated every other year since it was first introduced.  At the end of the day, the Little League organizations either outright failed to perform due diligence or their counsel was breathtakingly incompetent, as the construction was clearly illegal from the get-go. And despite this, they willfully chose to go ahead with it anyway, risking their own kidsâ baseball seasons on a brazen gamble that forgiveness would be forthcoming where permission was notâespecially if they appealed strongly enough to maudlin emotion to justify their lawbreaking.  I donât know about you, but if I decided to break the law, I highly doubt that âI did it for the kids!â would be considered a valid excuse. Itâs Responsibility Time, folks.   STRIKE ONE!  â Against the reckless, and may I say shockingly self-centered Little League organizations.  Then thereâs Councilman Sax, who appears to have given an absolutely virtuoso performance in playing the Little Leagues like a bunch of moronic suckers by luring them into building their ballfields illegally. The image of hundreds of teary-eyed children being denied the right to play baseball would make one hell of a propaganda tool to garner the average voterâs pityâthereby doing much to contribute to a public willingness to change state law for a county problem which he, to all appearances, incubated.   STRIKE TWO!  â Against Sax. Politics is dirty, this we all knowâbut politicians, at least, are adults and know what theyâre getting into. To gamble with childrenâs life experiences like this, wellâ¦ thatâs about as low as it gets, even for a career politician like Sax. There really are no words for this level of contemptibility.  Finally, thereâs Councilman Koster, whoâs come out trying to assign the blame for this whole pathetic fiasco to â1000 Friends of Washington,â of all organizations. 1000 Friends, being an environmental group, exists to protect the environment against the depredations of developers and their bought-and-paid-for politicians, like Koster and Sax. Kosterâs blame-spreading is actually side-splittingly hilarious in light of the fact that 1000 Friends has, incredibly, voiced a willingness to overlook the illegal land-grab and work to change the law at the county level to grandfather in the ballfields. Their position is a case study in practical compromise, and makes sense since itâs a county problem that the County Council helped create. Itâs also mighty generous considering that the purpose of 1000 Friends is to guard against precisely this kind of raping and pillaging of our natural resources.  Believe it or not, Koster will have none of it. So:   STRIKE THREE  â Against Koster, for demonstrating to us his idea of personal responsibility: âblame environmentalists.â  The fact that Sax and Koster are digging in their heels and refusing to work pragmatically to change the law at the county level tells you everything you need to know about their objectives. It seems pretty obvious that they set out to get the children into an extreme situation tailor made to solicit your sense of pity and urgency, use this deliberately nurtured county problem as a wedge to force a change in a state law theyâre trying to kill off on behalf of their masters, and scapegoat an environmental group in the process.  Their unwillingness to solve this at the county level is particularly illuminating considering that they had no problem fixing similar problems at the county levelâwhen it was a carlot and an antenna farm needing their ministrations and intervention, instead of a bunch of unwealthy, bothersome Little Leaguers.

But that only possible when we have enough capacity to make that extra concession -- give and take, so call.

Not because there's no other projects that need him, but it's because our bosses here are not ready to release him without securing a replacement first. So he feels very much at lost and in limbo now -- not very certain how his career would turn out in the next 6 months (and that's how long he could potentially need to wait). In the mean time, ""they"" just park him here to take care of some mundane tasks, without important responsibilities (because they afraid that he could be gone or redeployed anytime). I would like to think that there got to be more control that we have over our career. It should not be like this. Our life and career at the hand of our bosses (people who said they care, but really aren't at all!). But the sad thing is, with the current state of economy, there are not many option out there. What can I say, it's an employer's market now. You know what's more frustating? I could be next in line in the same situation, because my posting to the current project is about to expire (or reach the maximum allowed deployment time). And our HR would start to kick a big fuzz to have me redeployed, and our bosses would start to worry about finding out suitable replacement, and... and... the whole stupid things will repeat again. All in the name our keeping fresh idea, able to think out of the box, breakout from comfort zone, etc. etc. etc. but at the end of the day, they really are messing people life.",male,42,Consulting,Virgo,0

429828,3962045,2004-08-02,"Sometimes attachments in Lotus Notes is strange. For any reason, the Word icon is attached instead of the actual Word document. So when I try to click on the attachment, it was recognised as picture instead of attachment. One of my colleagues send out mass email announcement with Word documents attached. But one of the attachments are icon instead of the documents. Should I tell him? Nah... probably not. He probably won't appreciate it. And he probably thought I was too free to even borther to try to open the attachments, as if reading the email itself is not time consuming enough.",male,42,Consulting,Virgo,0

There's always a bigger dog around. So what's the moral of this story?  It's forget about who your boss is trying to please. Just concentrate on your own work, and let your boss do the licking  job :-)  afterall, we the real contributor, the knowledge worker, the professional, are not defined by our bosses.

438444,3736933,2004-06-30,"We have taken it alot easier today. We turned up at rehearsals last night only to find that nothing was ready yet. Us Koori's we have our 'Korri Time' well the Greeks here they have Greek time, ie the Olympics arenas not finished yet with like two weeks til the games atcually start. So anyway, Emma and Allan didn't get to have their sound check last night, we waited for ages, but the Greeks were working on their own time, things were supposed to be ready at 5:30pm and when 7:30pm came around and nothing was finished ie the stage, lighting, sound, we all decided to go back to the hotel and have dinner.   Our cab ride back from the museum was something we would not forget. The taxi driver was playing dumb, and trying to take us around the whole world, acting like he never knew where he was going, anyway, we came up to a street and he couldn't get through, there was police and army people everywhere. The taxi driver ordered us out, and said that their was a demonstration on and that we had to walk now. We barely knew where we were, and then all of a sudden we hear these loud screams and chanting going on. We started walking up the street, there was so many police everywhere, Emma was freaking out, we held each others hands, as we watched hundreds of people match the street, angry their voices. We didn't understand a word what was going on, and we were too scared to ask anyone. Today at our hotel we found out the march was a protest to the US embassy in regards to the war in Iraq.   The night ended quietly, I had sore feet by the time we got back to the hotel, it was again another early night.  Today we decided to take it easy. We had a quiet breakfast, and I watched Al iron all my clothes, pretty impressive he works good, ha ha, I train him good, jokes. And after that we headed down to the markets again for some more shopping. Wait til you see all the jewellery Al bought me. We walked around and then met up with the rest of the crew for lunch with Jennifer Bott who works for the Australia Arts Council. Lunch was great, we went to a great restaurant near the Plaka.   This afternoon Al and Emma are just practicing at the hotel,  the exhibition starts at 8:30pm. I am just about to go and ready, dressing up for the night. Jennifer told us that channel nine and channel seven are here from Australia, and that Cathie Freeman is sending a video message, and their is going to be lots of Australian Press, so I have to be looking the goods for the media, ha ha.   We are off on a cruise tomorrow to visit the islands of Agena, Poros and Hydra, they are fairly close to Athens, we would have loved to travel to Myconos, or Santorini, but time won't allow us, I think it is 6 hours ferry to Myconos. I am just excited to head to the beach and have a swim.",female,24,Education,Leo,1
438445,3736933,2004-06-29,"It is around 3:20pm on Tuesday afternoon. I am feeling extremely drained, we have had the biggest day. But I will start off with last night. Emma, Allan and the crew finally arrived at 7:30pm last night. They looked completely stuffed, and Emma's bag was lost, she got it back this morning (bloody QANTAS) ha ha. Anyway I waited for them to shower and we headed down town to find some dinner. We stopped off at a busy little taverna in one of the narrow streets not far from our hotel. The food was absolutley devine. I had the house speciality which consisted of lamb souvalaki, and garlic sauce on pita bread with salsa type stuff on top. I don't know the greek name but it was so yummy. Al and Emma had mixed Giros, and we all left the table holding our bellies. As they were all so tired, we retreated back to our rooms for an early night.  I was up as usual at 6am. Breakfast at the hotel, and then we headed for the markets. We passed lots of flash shops, but we looked mostly at the flea markets for little gifts. We walked all the way to the Ancient Agora. The road was really dusty, and bumpy with lots of rocks etc. We wandered along the paths to the top of the mountain to the Acropolis. We saw the Theatre of Dionysos, temple of Olympian Zeus and the Odeum of Herodes. The view from the top was magnificent. As this is my second trip to Athens I was surprised how the scenary still was able to captivate me. Allan was enjoying himself, camera happy taking pictures everywhere. Once I get back I will post some on this site (I still have to invest in a digital). Al missed a perfect photo opportunity as I fell over on the steps walking down from the Acropolis, nothing hurt though, just embarassment as it happened in front of plenty of tourists, ha ha.   After a few hours of touring around the lankmarks, we headed back to the city for some lunch. We ate at a great little cafe outside the gates of the Agora City. I love Mousakka, and I stuffed myself on this. We did a bit more shopping on the way back to the hotel.   Allan and Emma are getting their stuff ready as they have rehersals at 5:30pm over at the Benaki Contempory Museum where they will perform tomorrow night. It is getting exciting.",female,24,Education,Leo,1
438446,3736933,2004-06-27,"I arrived in Athens at 6:30am this morning, Greece time, but I think it was around 1:30pm Sydney time. The trip felt like it was never going to end, I guess it felt even longer as I was and still am by myself. Allan and the band are arriving tonight, their flight gets in at 5:30pm. I really feel for them, as they left before me yesterday, but cause their flight went via London it is taking them longer to get here. My flight wasn't that bad, I have been a great observer and had a few chuckles along the way. It was so funny last night, I was stopped over in Singapore for 2 1/2 hours, and I couldn't get over all these little old greek couples, they seemed to be bickering amongst themselves, and it all seemed to do with who was first, and going first. I had the same impression when I arrived at Athens airport. I was practically left for dead, trampled on as they all ran for passport lines, and then the baggage collection. I almost felt invisible as they pushed past me. But I had to laugh about it.  With the Olympics within weeks, I definately thought the airport security would have been fairly tight, but not all. After I finally made it the window to the customs/immirigration line, I was shocked that the guy didn't even say BOO to me. He took my passport looked at it, and stamped it, and pointed past him, not even a hello. My bags were not checked, scanned or x-rayed, I could have hid anything in it, but never mind, really it made getting out the place quicker.  My ride in the taxi to Plaka, where I am staying at the Electra Hotel was funny as. The taxi driver attempted to check how cluely I was, first acting like he didn't speak english, and then questioning me, I had a few phrases, and greetings written down in Greek, so I tried my foriegn tongue out, not bad I thought, and must have impressed him, as he didn't rip me off, and actually gave me a discount fair, well atleast I thought it was, it cost me $25 Euro, which is almost $50 Aus.  So I am now contemplating which way I will go, I think it is just after 10am here, after 5pm Sydney time, I just tried a Greek Mac, at Maccas, I was starving and it was the easiest thing to order, it tasted good, on a wrap bread with a yoghurt style sauce intsead of our mac's. I think I am going to wander around the streets until Allan and the rest of the crew arrive.",female,24,Education,Leo,1

The Greeks, they love to smoke (and smoke everywhere in taxi's, restaurants, while riding scooters and just about anytime), they love to eat (the best Gyros, souvalki and moussaka) and they love bright clothes and shoes (women in heels at the Acropolis, bright reds, oranges and yellow clothes, and lots of shoe shops.

438450,3736933,2004-07-02,"We cruised three islands yesterday on our ship the Anna Maru. At 7:30am we were picked up at the hotel and transfered to the marina to board the vessel. There were lots of tourists from Italy, France and even some other Aussies on board. We headed to the top deck to soak up the sun, which was absolutely gorgeous, there was light breeze that made it even more enjoyable as it was nice and refreshing.  First port of call was the island of Poros, time was limtied here, so Al and I just wandered the tiny little streets and looked in the shops. Our next island was Hydra. It was magnificent. Just like the postcards and paintings, all the buildings were white with little blue shutters on them. The locals were so friendly as they called you into their shops, one guy told us that the rpice of livign is extremely expensive their, and that the locals relied on the thousands of tourists for income. We walked around the port and up a hill to find a little swimming spot. It was beautiful. Imagine, walking a quaint little path and steps, to find the shore, sparkling crystal blue water, just waiting for you to dive in. Aroundthe shore line, was a cave that you could swim into. There were many little kids running and jumping form the top, their laughter was inviting, and Al and I joined them jumping into the cool water. The bottom seemed to go on forever, we both couldn't get over the clearness of the water.  Our final stop was the Island of Agena. Here we hired a little scooter. We had wanted to get one for ages, as we thought it would be fun. It cost us $15 Euro for an hour, which is close to $30 Aus dollars, but it was well worth it. While others were walking round, we flew past them on the scooter. Al riding, and me holding on for my life on the back. He was doing 60 and it was only 30 permited, but I don't think they have speed cameras, jokes. Ha ha. We rode to the other side of the island and found our own quiet little spot by the shore and went for a swim. I was starting to feel the sun then, my arms, neck and face are really browner, I got a tan , ha ha ha.   Our cruised ended back at Pieurus and we were transfered by coach back to our hotel. We were so stuffed, we finally hit the shower at 9pm, and were too lazy to go and get dinner so we ordered room service.",female,24,Education,Leo,1
438451,3736933,2004-08-16,"Today was my first day on the University of Hawaii Manoa Campus. I left with the other Norwegian girls at 8am and caught the bus. It kind of scary as we were not too sure where to go. I had a map and remembered some instructions Kerri-Ann had given me, so that was a start. We walked for what seemed for ages. The sun burning our skin as we treked along the road. Almost there we stopped at the University Health Services. We knew we had to get a check up there so we decided to get over and done with before getting to Rosemary's office. I was really unsure about the testing because of the baby. The nurse reassured me it was safe. They gave me a test in the skin for Tuberculous and they also gave me a blood test for the measles. After the blood test, I was faint, I collapsed on the floor out cold. I didn't remember how it happened, I just opened my eyes and I felt myself breathing so heavily. I was felt hot and was sweating. I had two nurses near me, one raising my legs and the other holding my hand and checking my pulse. I couldn't move, they eventually got me up into a wheelchair and took me to a bed to lie down and check me. I fell side ways, so the baby was okay. They checked me over, my blood pressure before letting me go. I didn't feel the best after that. I have a bruise on my arm from the blood test. I thought to myself later, if I can't handle a blood test, how am I going to handle labour, it makes me laugh. But the nurse said it is not uncommon for pregnant women to feel faint, especially seen as though I have just arrived and am adjusting in here to the climate etc.  After we left the health service we went to meet our International Exchange Officer Rosemary. She was so lovely, she gave me a warm hug when she saw me. She later told me that Sam and I would be the first Aboriginal Students from Australia to study here, and it made me feel important and special. It is a huge opportunity for people like us from our backgrounds. Rosie gave us a check list of things we needed to complete for enrolment. We set off in different directions, I was alone as I had different majors than the rest of the group.  My emotions were mixed all day. I think the fall had put me off, and I was less confident. I struggled to get a dollar bill into a vending machine to get a drink. I guy who appeared to be helpful offered to exchange coins with me for my note. What I realised after he walked away, that he duped me. He gave me 2 quarter dollars and 2 five cent pieces instead of 4 quarters. I was so thirsty and it really annoyed me, I think it was intentional you know. I forgot about it and walked towards the International Student Services to complete some paper work over there. Again I got frustrated as I didn't have everything yet, I needed this, and I couldn't do that until I got this, etc etc, and I started to get upset as I felt like I didn't know what I was doing. I walked away, and thought I will try and get some money so I can atleast get organised for my health plan. The bank was a joke, they wouldn't cash all my travellers cheques, and then they wanted to charge me for this etc and that etc, so I just got my money and left.  I walked outside across the park, and I felt helpless. What had I achieved, it was after 1pm and I had been at the uni since 8:8am and had got nothing finished. I decided to pay Kerri-Ann a visit. I needed to see her about subjects and registering, but more than anything, I just needed a familiar face. As I entered her office, she stood up and reached out for me. It was just what I needed, a big hug. I held her as I felt tears well in my eyes. I fought them back, and I didn't want to show her I was too sad. I explained what I needed to do, and she agreed to help me. But first things first, she took me to one of her favourite restaurants. It was great, and immediately I started to feel better. We ate at California Pizza at Ala Moana. We sat and talked, and it was the first time I really got to open up to Kerri-Ann about myself. I needed to talk to her, and she was such an attentive listener. I felt so drawn to her. When I listen to her talk, I hear the passion in her voice, the sincerity and the emotion. It moves me. I want to be just like her. Her voice has more power than I think she realises. I have always looked at Joe Fraser my old lecturer and Leanne King my lecturer and year coordinator for strength. Although the age gaps, they all inspire me. I look at them and I feel like I can do it. I want that PhD and I want to be able to write, write the truth and tell the real stories of Aboriginal people like them and me.  Coming to Hawaii was about learning more about myself, and another culture and people. I have always believed you learn to look more inside yourself when you step outside your usual surroundings.  After lunch Kerri-Ann and I settled my subject choices. We couldn't register them so I will have to return to her tomorrow to check on it. I came back to the hotel and have felt exhausted. I had a little nap, and talked to Hege about her day. It is good to offload to someone else, as well as hear about how her experience is for her as well.  Tomorrow will be day 2 of getting enrolled. Lets see how that goes.",female,24,Education,Leo,1
438452,3736933,2004-08-15,"Well we meet again, this time I am in Oahu, a beautiful island part of the state of Hawaii USA. I arrived last night at 11:20pm Hawaii time. The flight wasn't too bad, around 10 hours duration. I am staying at the Ocean Resort Hotel Waikiki. It is great, close to everything. I am sharing a studio unit with a girl called Hege from Norway. She is here studying on exchange just like me. I didn't get up to much last night, Kerri-Ann my wonderful Hawaiian contact picked me up from the airport. It was great to see a familiar face, she presented me with gifts of a necklace, a flowers lei and a candy lei. It was lovely.  I got to the hotel and was famished, I had to walk 5 blocks to find a convience store to get something to eat, phoned home and then forced myself to lay and rest to help the time difference. It is 20 hours behind Sydney over here.  The weather today has been beautiful. I went shopping to Ala Maona. It is a big mall on the other side of town. Over here they only know two directions, the mountains is one way, and the ocean is the other. Kerri-Ann said I should never get too lost, cause all you have to do is just look around and walk the other way.  My experiences with American/Hawaiian culture have already cracked me up. The money is the worst, I have to make sure I look at the notes properly as the money all looks the same. The coins are a pain as well. I had to ask someone how much a dime was, I have since found out it is 10 cents, see my nan was right, you learn something new everyday. Getting the bus to the shops was funny as well, I went to pay the driver and he laughed, and instructed me to put the money in this little machine, and I said to him, do I get a ticket, and he giggled again and said well do you want one, and I felt a little silly.  Everyone has been really friendly, there seems to be a lot of tourists and visiting people here, so much that it almost seems hard to pick out who are locals and who are not.  The view from my room is breath taking. On one side you see mountains, and the other side is the ocean, blue and sparkling. Around the city it is very green, lots of trees and plants, it is a really clean and beautiful place. I will post some photos as I have a new digital camera now, but I will have to wait til I go to uni tomorrow so I can do it. I am using the hotel computers and it costs alot of money.",female,24,Education,Leo,1

Heres the article: 4-year-old says he jumped 'like a superhero'  A 4-year-old would-be superhero escaped serious injury Saturday after he jumped from a second-story window at his family's north Spokane apartment building.  The boy, who was not identified by police, lives with his mother in the 600 block of north Oak. Police said the child jumped through an open, unscreened window and landed on grass below, narrowly missing a patch of concrete and a barbecue. Police Supervisonr Sgt. Marc Wheelwright said the fall could have killed the boy had he landed in the wrong spot. The boy told nurses he jumped through an open window ""like a superhero,"" according to Spokane Police. Officers said his mother and her boyfriend were asleep at the time, around 2 p.m. The window had been propped open by a stick, according to a police report. Police said the sill was about 2 feet from the floor. After being taken to the hospital, the boy was given a CT scan which showed no head injuries.

We talked every single day for at least 5-6 hours every night and then we talked on the phone a lil bit too. well we finally decided to meet. the day he came over to meet me i got hit by a car so i was havin a bad day but all that went away when i saw him. i was so excited to meet him. anyways we hung out a lil bit that day then he had to go to work. then the next day he came over and spent the night kinda, he had to leave early tho cuz he had to work at the Lilac parade (he was a crowd control person...he works for the SPD) so we watched movies pretty much all night, and he cuddled up next to me, and like 5 minutes later we started making out. this was my first time ever doing this with a guy. or anybody to tell you the truth. and it went a bit further but im not gonna talk about that. anyways after that i started to fall in love with him. and then the day after i pretty much asked him out, he asked me if i wanted to see his new boyfriend. i was so depressed! and he didnt even care. then he started bein a real asshole to me.

459821,3751152,2004-08-04,"If you're coming from abroad and are planning to fly into/out of Castlegar from/to Vancouver then you'll need to check out the flight schedules.  The daily flights are limited as they need to see the mountains in order to land.  These are all on Air Canada.  Once Northern Hawk Air releases their fall schedule to Trail, I will post them as well.  Here they are:   VANCOUVER-Intl - YVR to CASTLEGAR (BC) - YCG   Departure Times : 8:15 am, 11:45 am & 3:30 pm    CASTLEGAR (BC) - YCG to VANCOUVER-Intl   Departure Times :  9:55 am, 3:30 pm & 5:10 pm	   If you are planning to come on a weekend, it is likely that the early morning flight is not available.  Please keep in mind that these are DH1 and DH3 type aircrafts as well :)   In addition, unless you are flying Air Canada from Europe and are booking all the way through to Castlegar, you will have to go through International Customs at Vancouver and collect your baggage.  Then you will have to go to domestic departures and check-in again.  I've done this MANY times before with only an hour to spare so it is definitely possible. Typically, I will use YVR's  urlLink Express Check-in  kiosks and then hand over my baggage.  Alternatively, if you don't want to rush, you can either hang out in Vancouver for a night and fly to Castlegar the following day *OR* look at doing an overnight bus ride on  urlLink Greyhound .  Honestly, though, the cost of the flight vs. the cost of the bus is almost the same.",male,27,Technology,Capricorn,0

I don't think Adam/Fire really cares either :)  You have to understand that we have jobs we'll have to go to, so if that isn't a big deal to you and you want to stay an extra week or so, then feel free.  I think the longest someone stayed at my place at the last meet was 3 weeks :)  For those of you who are wary about meeting people from the WEEEEB, here is a funny little comic that portrays how people are online versus realife:   urlLink     Teehee!

459823,3751152,2004-08-04,"So I figured I would do a bit of research and find out what sort of prices people should expect for flights.  Here are my results:  - Vancouver to Castlegar, return, on  urlLink Air Canada  fluctuates between $299 and $320 CAD.  If you are going to book this flight, please keep in mind that there are only 3 flights per day. - Vancouver to Trail, return, on  urlLink Northern Hawk Air  is roughly $368 but this could change after Labour Day once they publish their new fall flight schedule. - London Gatwick to Vancouver, return, on  urlLink Canadian Affair  works out to 338 GBP.  I chose a UK departure of Oct 7 and return flight of Oct 14.  If you chose this option you'd also have to get the above flight from Vancouver.  Alternatively, you can fly from London Gatwick to Calgary for 337 GBP (Ooooooh) and then hook up with Camerak in Calgary.  You'd have to work out driving dates, etc with him though. - Charlotte, NC to Seattle, WA, return, on  urlLink Travelocity  works out to 238.70 USD.  You'd have to work out driving times with Lorax on this one.  If you chose to fly out of Raleigh instead it would go down to 232.90 USD.  Going to Spokane would be more expensive - i.e. from Raleigh it works out to be about 421 USD. - Atlanta to Seattle is 359.40 USD also on Travelocity.  If you flew to Spokane, WA instead it would be 381.90 USD.  Depending on your flights we could probably pick you up in Spokane as its only 2.5 hours from us. - Phoenix, AZ to Spokane, WA on Travelocity is about 193.40 USD. - San Francisco to Seattle is 153.20 USD roundtrip (Travelocity).  From there you'd have to hook up with Lorax to get here.  Alternatively, you could fly from San Francisco to Spokane which is more expensive at 253.40 USD but you cut the driving time to your final destination probably by more than half (as compared to Seattle).  And thats all I have right now.  If you want something priced out - let me know and I'll see what I can find.    P.S.

459825,3751152,2004-08-02,"Now before this continues on, I figure I'd give you some more details on this area and what to expect:   Accommodations :  As it is cheaper and generally more convenient for people to be all in one place, we are basically opening up our house to everyone.  The house has 2 furnished spare rooms, each with double beds, and one unfurnished spare room (empty).  There are also two couches and we'll have the use of a camping trailer in our driveway (it has a double bed and 2 singles).  Two tents will be available and we also have plenty of floor space.  If you want an idea of what the house is like there are before and after photos  urlLink here .  Should somebody really want to stay in a hotel there is one in Fruitvale called the Villager's Inn about 5 mins away - and I believe it is quite cheap.   The Area :  Here are a few websites that might be of interest if you want to get some insight into this area. 1) urlLink Fruitvale , this is where Adam & I live.  2) urlLink Trail , about 15 mins drive from us.  Has a small airport & is where we'll go if we go to a 'club'. 3) urlLink Castlegar , about 25-30 mins from us.  Location of another airport and other random stuff.  4) urlLink Nelson , a hippy-esque city about 1 hr from us. 5) urlLink Rossland , about 20 mins from us.  Home of the ski hill and gold mining museum.  6) urlLink Creston , about an hour from us. Home of the  urlLink Kokanee  brewery where we could do a tour should the thought strike us.   The Cost :  If you're coming from a country that deals in anything other than Canadian currency then you're in luck.  This area is extremely inexpensive so your cash will go much further (even compared to Toronto for all those who went to CAN2).  Even for other Canadians it will be relatively inexpensive. Obviously, the biggest cost is getting here - and then maybe the beer if you're going to have a lot ;)  If you are looking at ways to decrease the cost of you getting here, please feel free to ask as there may be some way we can help.  Until next time...",male,27,Technology,Capricorn,0
459826,3751152,2004-08-02,"So I made this up figuring it was a good place for people to see what is new, to ask questions or even just to laugh about old times (as well as post any links to old meet stuff)! I guess I'll start with the details of the upcoming meet:  Where: Trail/Fruitvale, BC, Canada When: Oct 8-11, 2004  If you are looking at flying in the closest airports are Castlegar and Trail.  Castlegar is serviced by  urlLink Air Canada  from Calgary and Vancouver and Trail is serviced by  urlLink Northern Hawk Air  from Vancouver only.  Coming from the UK, so far the cheapest flights I have found into Vancouver are with  urlLink Canadian Affair .  Again, you can also catch a ride with Jake/Camerak in Calgary or Steve/Lorax in Seattle. Flying into Spokane, WA is also an option.  Questions? :)  Enjoy!",male,27,Technology,Capricorn,0
459827,3751152,2004-06-30,"At 18.30 on Tuesday the tube strike started, it ended about 18.30 today. In that space of 24 hours I have been shocked by two things 1) Londoners have legs, and 2) Londoners are generous. Let me explain....  A lot of people commute into London from the suburbs and beyond. We have quite an extensive public transport network consisting of underground and over-ground trains, buses, taxis etc. The rail union for underground staff decided to hold a strike which people feared would bring London to a standstill and would cost the economy a heck of a lot of money. So this morning I walked into work - which is only like 25 mins and I often walk in anyways. The buses were packed, the roads were chockablock with cars, buses and taxis. It was total gridlock. Buses were having to drop people off half-way along the route leaving disgruntled commuters stuck half-way to work, but as I was walking along I noticed something amazing. There were lots of other people walking and more cyclists than normal. I was quite surprised, I guess when the worst happens and you have to get into work you make the effort. It does makes me wonder why these people don't walk more often.   But anyways, I can't comment coz I do often get the bus, and I did for the journey home (mainly because I wasn't feeling well - summer cold or something coming on methinks). So I waited with the not-so-large queue of people and got on the first bus that came. Well one lady didn't have change for the ticket machine (in central london you now have to buy your ticket before getting on the bus) and looked quite dismayed as she trudged off the bus having been told by the bus driver he had no change so couldn't take her. But then, from out of nowhere her guardian angel appeared, a lady who had like a carnet of bus tickets and just gave her one. How's that for generosity! Well it certainly proved to me that out there there are nice people in the world, and thanks to one of them, that lady got home a little earlier than she would have done with her faith in the world restored :)",male,27,Technology,Capricorn,0
459828,3751152,2004-06-29,"Itâs been sort of a strange couple of days.  Every once and a while, I sort of move into brief periods like this where everything seems mildly surreal, as if Iâm seeing things through a slightly skewed reflection and Iâm not immersed in anything around me but instead drifting along in parallel, idly headed along somewhere.  Itâs a very odd feeling of detachment that sort of permeates everything that I do.  Itâs a sort of âcatcher in the ryeâ type of feeling, isolation, sinking between curbs, and all thatâI donât really know.  I saw a play last night called âI Am My Own Wife.â  It was quite interesting and very well done, and in fact won the Pulitzer recently.  Itâs a one-man performance (something which always impresses me) and the plot is fairly complexâitâs largely based on the life of a transvestite Berlinerâwhoâs also a furniture collector and restorer and lives in a museum filled with old phonographsâborn in the early 20th century and his (her) experiences as a homosexual living through two oppressive regimes: the Nazis and the communists.    The story is told, however, from the point of view of the author (an American homosexual man and the only actor in the play) who visits Berlin and tapes interviews that he conducts with her about her life for the purpose ofâyesâwriting a play.  So, itâs sort of both an autobiography of the authorâs interactions with her, and a biography of her life, and scenes from both are interspersed to create a pretty powerful performance.  I would recommend it to anyone who has the chance to see it.  Going up to the country for a bit of a vacation tomorrow, which should be nice.  Itâs summer, so I should be relaxed, but somehow I feel guilty about being relaxed, which makes it impossible to be relaxed.  So, yeah, hopefully I can just chill out.

459829,3751152,2004-06-29,"It feels sort of surreal around here right now. Saturday my babygirl will be turning 13, a teenager by definition. She definitely has moments of teenagerdom. She spends hours on the phone, she's forever painting her nails, fiddling with her hair and experimenting with makeup. The posters on her walls have changed from cuddly puppies to Orlando Bloom looking for all the world like a lecherous pedophile ready to pounce on my daughter - oh wait no, that's Ginge :)  The other day we were in the middle of laundry so she had on some old shorts and a tank that was far too small for her. Cleavage was everywhere, curves were there in places where there shouldn't be curves yet (at least not in my mind). It was startling. She looked older, and yet she was sitting on the couch playing with bubbles like a kid. I just can't get my head around this weirdness.  Of course she just laughs at me, or rolls her eyes when I point out all of this to her. She says she doesn't feel any different than she did last week and that I'm just being weird. Well, yes I am being weird, but it is a weird feeling. I wish I could explain it better. Maybe Kat will get some idea of it when her kidlets reach this age.  I find myself comparing her to what I remember of my teen years, or my sister's since Kelly (my sis) is 8 years younger than me, I can remember what she was like. I'm trying to avoid the pitfalls I remember. I'm probably more lenient with my daughter than my mom was with me; I know I talk to her more than my mom did with me about things that weren't big subjects when I was a teen (finances, sex, drugs and all that).

No, it appears that there could be something wrong - they aren't quite sure yet what but I have to get an ultrasound either tomorrow or Wednesday so they can check it out.  Joy.  What does that mean? Well, they figure there are a few options - either I have a simple infection or there are pieces still left inside (which apparently could be from the one sac or perhaps therein lies the possibility that there was twins) OR it could be both.

So I get to take these orange horse pills for the next week - whee!  If its the ""pieces"" option then I get to have a D&C.   Yeah, I know - WTF is that?

459832,3751152,2004-06-27,"This weekend I was once again in Amsterdam and having been to the cinema to see Shrek 2 - I want a puss in boots! - Monster and I went to watch the Holland-Sweden match in one of the pubs in the centre. Having secured what seemed to be the last seat in the pub we settled down to wait for the match to start. It was amazing at how packed the pub became and I don't think I've ever seen so many people wearing orange - not even at the Easyjet check-in desks! Naturally the majority of the pub were supporting Holland, altho we did see one chap in a Sweden t-shirt who interestingly had an Italy sweatshirt tied round his waist - wise move methinks with that many orange peeps about ;)   Whilst it was a good match, I couldn't help feeling a little saddened as I recalled that only two days before I'd been sat gripped by the England-Portugal match and as the game went to penalties (as Monster had kept on telling me it would) I felt I couldn't quite join in with the euphoria of the celebrations as Van de Sar saved the penalty and Robben scored to win the game for Holland. Up until Saturday's match Holland had been afflicted with the same penalties curse as England - for some reason they just couldn't win a match on penalties and it was always heartache for the nation - but now for Holland at least the curse was lifted, and I felt a little jealous. I guess England just have to wait their turn for the curse to be lifted - or practice their penalty taking! Anyways, whilst I'm not switching my allegiance, I do kinda feel a warmth towards Holland so they'll be getting my support for the rest of the tournament, and as my darling boyfriend pointed out my hair does match the team colours ;)",male,27,Technology,Capricorn,0
459833,3751152,2004-06-27,"They are a little slow but they get the idea. When I sold my condo a few years ago I told them that they should buy a townhouse and I'll just pay them rent. This way they have a second house that they can make money off of and I can still have a house (I hate paying property organizations like Paradigm).  Of course they just hated this idea, assuming I was trying to pull something over on them (as if) and since I didn't feel like going through the paperwork of getting another house until I figure out where I want to live, I just submitted and rented out this apartment.  Now fast forward to June 27. My mother calls me and we're talking about her trip this week. She's going to be seeing some old friends, one of whom owns four houses in the Charlotte, N.C. area. They rent three of them out to their kids and just bought a fourth for themselves. Of course they've retired early and make great money off the interest rates of the homes while charging their kids pretty minimal rent to stay there. The thinking is that they can help their kids save up and buy houses of their own.  Now all of a sudden my parents think this is a WONDERFUL idea. Just brilliant. They were asleep when I sold my condo and suggested this idea but now thou art awaken.   Sounds all good but I've got six months on my current lease and I'm stuck, plus there's no guarantee I'll want to live here when it's up. So now they want to do this thing fairly quickly (they are impatient/impulsive like that) and I'm stuck in rental hell. I'm so angry I can't even give them a shit-eating ""I told you so"" grin.   So there are two options: either a) beg and plead the properties company to let me out of my lease (HA!) or b) Wait and see. The hope is I'll know whether I'm staying here or moving elsewhere by October and we can search for a place. The only saving grace could be if I get this particular job and I'll be forced to move somewhere in between Jacksonville and Atlanta. That could at least solve my lease problems because the paper will just give me the money to buy it out or take over the last six months and put an intern there or something.

So I reinstalled my OS, and instantly became inundated with spyware all over the place. I cannot stress enough how evil that shite is and how the perpetrators of it should be dragged through a field of glass and then hung, drawn and quartered with me to slap the horses' backsides as they tear their limbs off.

We FINALLY found the hair dye after I went to one of the salons to ask where I could find temp hair dye. I had been to Walgreens, Osco's, the Party Store, Target... so when I left there, I stopped by where Paul gets his hair cut and asked them and they sent me to a place like Sally's Beauty Supply.

However they did have the HP glasses in stock! So, for just a split second I got excited but that excitment faded as soon as I saw the price tag of $70.

459838,3751152,2004-06-25,"We all know that getting really, really drunk just sucksâthereâs no two ways about it.  Sure, its fun for a little while, but it takes twice as long to recuperate, not to mention the fact that the process of recovery is twice as harrowing as getting tipsy is amusing (a concept that, admittedly, TCZ spods seem pretty familiar with).  However, whatâs worse than getting really, really drunk, is getting really, really drunk at the same party your parents are at and then having to go home with them, sleep in the same house as them and therefore subsequently have to  wake up  in the same house as them.    I bring this up because this was exactly the predicament that I found myself in last night.  Let me just tell you, if I never have another sip of alcohol in the presence of my parents again it will be too soon.  Anyway, as you can probably imagine (or recall, if this has ever happened to you), this morning has made me greatly regret last night as it's been a lovely medley of kneeling over the bath-tub, bouts of insane awkwardness that ensued about the time of our rather rude awakenings (as it were), and other pleasant things of that nature.    So, allow me to close with two final thoughts, which are really just the same final thought repeated for emphasis: God damn margaritas, god  damn  them.  End Rant;",male,27,Technology,Capricorn,0

I mean you deal with money *all* day long except that NONE of it is yours.  None.  Nada.  Zilch.  Zip.  So it sucks.  It especially sucks when all day you are looking at accounts that have $20K or more in them - and again, its  NOT  yours.  Its amazing for this area - such small towns - how much money there really is.  There are so many rich people here, people you'd never GUESS had that much money... its crazy.  When is it my turn?  Anyways, as I was saying before I got onto the whole money thing - working sucks.  You know, I moved here late December - quit my job to move to a small town in the Kootenays and, maybe, hopefully, find a new job.  And I have one - its part-time/casual mind you but its a job.  But I now realize I hate working.  I had 3 months of doing-whatever-the-hell-I-want and I liked it.  I want that back.  Hell, I want a job where I can work from home so I can show up in my PJs.  That would even be acceptable.  But this getting up to go work for someone else really bites.  Especially at a job where you deal with money and none of it is yours.  Its Friday, its been a long day, I don't know what to make for dinner and I'm tired.

I finish a load and a new pile of dirty clothes appears out of nowhere. I fear they are reproducing. I fear they will take over my apartment and hold me hostage. At times I can almost hear them planning their next moves.   They've taken over the kitchen. I still have the bedroom, but everytime I look away their army piles get closer. I fear I will not be able to hold them off much longer. I may need to relocate into the living room. I have planned an alternate way into the living room in case things get too bad.

459841,3751152,2004-06-24,"My first ever blog.  From the guy who thought that writing your own blog was boring, uninteresting and pointless.  I would much rather read about other people's problems, days and lives than have them read about my own,  But oh well, I'll give this a try.  By far this is the worst year of my life.  Things from January til mid April were just shitty for my family.  Suicide attempts, job loss, heart problems, blood pressure, drug problems, deaths, broken hips and lots of problems.  Well, just when I had thought that May was great and June was almost over problem free, WHAM!  My grandmother who broke her hip in March (and was only given a week to live then) has gotten pneumonia and was found in her bed on Tuesday morning bleeding from the mouth and nose.  She is so fragile that the coughing she had been doing was ripping her throat open and causing her to bleed.  So she was rushed to the hospital where she was put on IV and oxygen immediately.  Within a few hours, she was doing better, but not much.  The coughing and such had subsided.  The poor woman is 96, and will be 97 in July.  She has Alhzeimers and knows no one.  It really hurts my Dad for him Mother to not know who he is.  She has gone from being about 180 lbs and in decent health in the early 90's to being an 80 lb person with no quality of life, who knows no one, is blind in both eyes, is deaf and doesn't speak.  I find it so unfair that young people are killed every day, all around the world, yet here is a woman who 'I haven't known in 10 years' who is in pain with a broken hip, requires morphine daily to keep down the pain.  She lies in bed suffering, and yet people are dying every day who I know she would if she could, gladly give them her life.  Anyway, enough with that.  I feel so much better now that I've vented.  And for those who didn't know, I recently started a new job in May.  I am a Support Specialist Level I at the University of Lethbridge library.  I moved across Canada to be here.  I live with Weagle (Scott) and Sydney (Susan) currently.  I am really enjoying my new job and the new area.  As my new manager said this morning, ""You'll be my Jake-of-all-trades.""  I will be doing html and java script, along with redesigning some webpages for the library, along with my current PC repair and media duties.  I'm excited.  The more useful I can make myself, the better chance that this will become a full time position for me after this contract expires.  Other than that, I really don't have much more to say.  For the last week, I have been watching my DVD set of Robotech, the first series, with Rick Hunter, Minmei, Max Sterling, Lisa Hayes and crew.  It's a great anime series from the early 80's.  I can't get enough of it.  But at 50 dollars a boxed set, and I have 3 of the 7, I couldn't afford more.  But then I tried Ebay and found them for about 5 dollars to 10 dollars American and started buying them up.  2 more sets are on the way and I'm currently bidding on 2 more.  This rocks!  It's exciting.  This weekend will be fairly quiet.  I hope to go to Cranbrook with Scott and Susan to drop off Susan's car for her parents, but I may just stay home and watch the NASCAR race from Sonoma, California!  I love road racing.

459842,3751152,2004-06-24,"Well, not only is this my first contribution to the TCZ blog, itâs also my first blog post ever.  I decided it was due time that I gave in to the blog hysteria after having ""lurked"" on many a blog but never actually taken the time to join and start posting my thoughts.  As a bit of a disclaimer, I'll just start off by saying that I'm fairly sure that most of the stuff that goes on in my life is of little to no interest to anyone else and I'll do my best not to bore anyone here, but I take no responsibility if you end up bored nonetheless ;-)  So, for those of you that donât know me too well, Iâm a student living in New York City, which I suppose is a pretty good place to be a student (though I donât have much of a frame of reference since Iâve lived here my whole life).  People seem to have a lot of weird stereotypes about New Yorkers in general though, which is pretty odd considering this is one of the most ethnically and intellectually diverse cultural centers in the world.  Consequently, there tends to be a lack of homogeneity in how people act and think, and thatâs one of things I like most about living hereâyou rarely know what to expect when meeting new people.  In all fairness, though, I probably donât fully utilize what New York has to offer.  There are literally hundreds of bars, clubs, museums, institutes, theatres, and other diversions of social/cultural persuasion, but I tend to only visit a few of them regularlyâthen again, another thing I like about New York is knowing that theyâre there anyhow.  I like having options.  Sure, I always order Chinese from the same place, but that doesnât mean I donât like knowing that I could order it from about 20 other places if I felt so inclined!  I happen to live in a really nice residential area of the city right by Central Park, which makes the general urban hubbub a lot easier to deal with.  The Park is a pretty extraordinary entity.  It plays host to hundreds of thousands of people day in and day out, providing a much needed breather from the sirens and car alarms and cab drivers yelling in rabid middle-eastern languages.  Itâs pretty small when you consider it geographically, and yet in the two almost-two-decades Iâve been visiting it I still always manage to find something new each time I go.  I love the city, but sometimes I really need nature, and the park can provide quick respite from the towering walls of brick and glass at every turn when I donât get the chance to take a full fledged vacation.  On a slightly different note, after reading the Timesâ review of Michael Mooreâs new movie, Fahrenheit 9/11 (link  urlLink here ), I really, really, really want to see it (of course, I still really wanted to see it beforehand, but now I want to see it even more!).  I canât say I love Michael Moore, but he does make pretty interesting movies.  Sure, they can be contradictory and at times downright annoying, but theyâre also often really illuminating, and they shed light on a lot of problems in the US that are overlooked by the many people sitting pretty in its uppermost echelons (who unfortunately happen, more often than not, to be the decision makers).  Anyway, so concludes my deflowering post.  I am no longer a blog virgin. Yay.",male,27,Technology,Capricorn,0
459843,3751152,2004-06-24,"How I learned to love to post and stop worrying about the Bomb.  Blogging is overrated. The newsmedia likes to say that blogging is 'the new art form', 'the ""NEW"" new media'. Instead of writing letters to the editor, we're told that we can reach a greater audience through our blogs, where the whole world can come to our pulpit and listen to us espouse our views, personality, etc.  There are many, many problems with this:  1. The majority of people online don't have personalities. This community does, thank god, but how many blogs have you read where it's 'i went to school and she was like 'omg, look at u, she's usch a b!tch!''. An infestation of 14 year olds; the only cure, to go back in time and castrate their fathers, if they even know who their fathers are.  2. On the odd chance that someone DOES have a personality, it's most likely a female. Thus, the readership of the blog is all men, desperate men who will wax poetically about how great the blogger is for the sole purpose of getting into her pants. I've seen this happen more then once. The supposed great thing about blogging is that you can learn a lot about a person from what they write. Unfortunately, it usually degrades into ""Whoa, she's hot, I'm going to read her blog!""    3. The other sect of common bloggers are nerds. Nerds who will blog about their favorite Star Trek: Voyager episode or posting pictures of their new computer case mod. You know the type. ""Smarter"" then everyone else, everyone else is a fool, everyone else is ignoring the obvious, everyone else should just do what I say and then everything will be ok. They are also found hanging around #2 blogs, not to mention their parents basement.  4. Political blogs are the worst. There is no grey. There are ""Democraps"" and ""Republi-Cons"". Attempting to determine meaning from these blogs is pointless. You're better off reading the hot girls blogs for all of the 'information' you're going to get.  5. Bloggers have nasty, nasty habits of regurgitating other blogs. Just like email chain letters that get sent around, communities of bloggers pop up parroting the same old information that appears on everyone elses blog. Instead of individual thought and expression, we get ""SO and SO posted this on his blog, *Copy and paste*"". In an attmept to be more popular, we mimic those that we want to get attention from. A lot like high school really. I always wanted to be the head cheerleader :(  At any rate, this blog is different. We all come from different backgrounds, countries, ideals and the only thing that binds us is a little thing we like to call TCZ. This forum is open to everyone, the high school girls, the snooty computer nerds, the pseudo-political-intellectuals and thus, if there was ever a blog that you should read, this should be it.  *cross-posted to Adam Online, LiveJournal, DeadJournal because that's what computer nerds do.

459844,3751152,2004-06-24,"It's freaking freezing in my office today. I think Joey has been messing with my thermometer. So I type this with frozen fingers.  Anyway... It's apparently Hawaiian Day at work today. I just got lei'd (har har.) I think one of the nursing units decided to have a bit of fun today and did the hawaiian theme and it's spread throughout the hospital. There are always, in every organization, those people who go all out on things like this. The woman who came in with the leis was dressed in full-on Hawaiian mumu, with big floppy hat and sunglasses and she's going around to all the departments in my building handing out the leis.  I wish I could be that unselfconscious. I'm more the 'These leis itch' type and mine are now sitting on a corner of my desk. Tonight I'll take them home and give them to my darling daughter who will probably hand them off of a nail stuck in the wall and there they will hang until the end of time. Then a year from now I'll see them and wonder where the hell they came from.  Wow two paragraphs out of Hawaiian Day. And I was worried I wouldn't have anything to write about :)  God I really wish people would refrain from bursting into my office as if it's just some closet or something. It scares the bejeezus out of me because I don't see them coming. Here I am, thinking hard about what to write in here (yes I know I should be working, but I'm on my lunch hour), staring at my keyboard, willing it to extract the thoughts from my head when the door flies open with a loud crack and some chirpy person from the Education department breezes in on her way to the *actual* closet attached to my office. I have a private office but one of the bad things about it is that the Education department keeps all of their CPR dummies in the closet here. Whenever they have a class over in my building (usually they're located in the other building) they're in and out of my office constantly all day long. It's a little annoying and disruptive, especially with the noisy door and their tendency to burst in without warning. Then they leave the damn closet door open with the light on (well, it's more of a hall actually) and it's even colder in there than it is in my office. Grrrrr.  So, speaking of feeling scared (nice segueway eh?), I'll chime in on Fire's post about fears to mention mine. I actually think I've talked about mine before when Anne posted in the BBS once asking 'what scares the hell out of you.' I love to swim. But I cannot have someone hanging on me while doing so. Not my daughter, or a boyfriend or just a friend playing a friendly game of 'dunk.' I'm afraid I'll be pushed under and then be unable to surface. So I guess it's a drowning fear. I can't even stand to watch underwater sequences in films or on TV either. I get out of breath and tense. I even know what the fear stems from because it's probably one of the most vivid early memories I have.  When I was little, we moved to an apartment complex in Palm Springs, CA which, of course, had a pool. They all did in Palm Springs because the heat there is atrocious. Anyway, I was innocently paddling around in it one day when my friend decided to jump in, land on me, and cling to me. She wouldn't let go either and I kept going under and had absolutely no control, no chances to grab a breath before going back under. All the while she was giggling and thought we were having a great time. I don't remember exactly how old I was, but we couldn't have been more than five I guess. Anyway, I'm positive that's why I can't stand anyone hanging on me in the water.  The other thing I fear is the same as Joey, and that's death. I don't like to think about my own mortality, and I definitely have nightmares about something happening to my daughter. That scares me to pieces. The more I think about it though, I think death saddens me moreso than scares me I guess. The fear is my own death and what would happen to my daughter and my family and friends. The sadness from worrying about losing what little family I have left. And I know that was never much a concern of mine until my father suddenly died, followed several years later by my mother who also died out of the blue. No one close to me had ever died before that could have prepared me for such devastating losses. Even just writing about it now makes me feel sort of weepy.  So I shall stop.

NL stands for No-Limit.  The game in question is Texas Holdem...The Cadillac of Poker  I've been kinda a student to the game of No-Limit Texas Holdem for about 4 years now.  When I was at the Casino a few weeks ago on training (Not poker training, work training, I just stayed at the casino hotel :)), I picked up a few magazines that are delivered to all canadian casinos.  Its called Canadian Poker Player ( urlLink Http://www.canadianpokerplayer.com ).  In the May issue, they had an article regarding home games.  I was very shocked to see that there was an article about a home game right here in Fredericton.  So I sent them an email to get an invite to their weekly home games and monthly tournaments.  Tonight will mark my first NL tournament with this group, and I'm very much looking forward to it.  I've been playing with the same group of guys from home for years now, and I pretty much know their betting patterns and strategies.  When you sit down at a table with a completely new crowd, you always learn something new.  I'm very much looking forward to tonight, not only for the game I love, but to meet new people in the city.    Now, off that subject, and maybe a quick response to Fire's post regarding fears....  I never thought I did before, but I really fear death.  I sometimes get this chill in my body whenever I think of what would happen if I died tomorrow, what the (2, maybe 3 ;)) people would do if I was gone.  When I was young, I was kinda a daredevil...I never feared getting hurt, and would do just about anything people dared me to do.  Now that I'm settling down with my life, I fear dying more and more every day.  I wonder why I do.  I guess its the natural life cycle.    I never really noticed this until I started flying.  My trip to Jamaica a few years ago included me almost going nuts in the plane when it was in turbulance.  So, maybe its a combination of fear of death and fear of flying.

459847,3751152,2004-06-23,"Having recently gone through a traumatic experience, I've spent a lot of time discussing things, stuff and items with my significant other. One thing that came up was my fear that what actually did happen would happen. Fear is a funny thing. On the one hand, it crushes your spirit, destroys your body and dampens your enthusiasm; on the other hand, fear is a necessary adjunct to living. It prepares you for extreme circumstances (Fight or Flight) and prevents you from engaging in things that may cause your bodily harm (Taking a beer away from Camerak, for example). So, what do YOU fear?  As some people may or may not know, I'm quite claustrophobic. If I'm travelling as a passenger in a vehicle, more often than not you'll see me huddled up against the window; and if I'm not at a window, I'll be asleep (or some reasonable variant therein, eyes closed, breathing slowly). When I book flights, I always using the seating arrangements to ensure I have a window seat. If I can't get a window seat, I'll take an aisle seat...but I really cannot stand sitting between two people; there's something quite debilitating about being stuck between two people. A while back, on a 1 hour flight to Calgary, I was trapped between a rather large man and a smaller asian girls, and I was scared I was going to flip out. I attempted to sleep it off, but my body kept violently jerking me awake as some type of reflex. In Switzerland, I was travelling down a gondola in the middle of a fairly intense snowstorm (enough that I couldn't see out the windows) and by the time I got to the bottom I was not a happy camper...felt quite nauseous. I discovered another phobia of mine, but I'm not quite sure the word for it so I'll have to cram two phobias I do know into one..I call it: agoracousticophobia, the fear of the noise of large crowds. I was sitting at dinner in Earls today, and sitting at my table, listening to the cacophony of people and cars and dishes rattling and the like was steadily making me more and more uncomfortable. I wouldn't say that I was physically afraid, but I could feel flight or fight impulses taking over. My ears were becoming very sensitive to the near-randomness of the conversations drifting in and out of earshot. Likewise with walking down Robson St. in Vancouver. I'm almost forced to shut off my brain temporarily and drift on automatic, focussing on some deep down need to get home to the quiet.   Thankfully, I do have an explanation for this fear. I have one regularly occuring dream that continues to haunt me. I am in a large dark cavern-like place. I hear what sounds like a ball rolling towards me. The rolling sound becomes louder and louder and the cavern I am in becomes smaller and smaller. The closer the sound gets, the worse it sounds; like static on a radio mixed with screams and horns and any noise you can think of. At the same time I feel the weight of whatever is approaching slowly pushing me. I fall to my knees, cover my ears with my hands and cannot block out the sounds or the feelings. I feel myself almost shrinking in response to my 'attacker'...I welcome my shrinking as I will be less likely to be crushed if I am small enough to pass by. The sound-ball/shrinking-cavern collapses on me and I wake up screaming. Disconcerting to say the least; I've had this dream many times.   Let's see what the DREAM DICTIONARY tells us:   Shrink  To dream that you are shrinking, suggests that you lack self-confidence and self-esteem. You may also feel embarrassed or unimportant in some situation. Perhaps you feel that you have been overlooked by others. Alternatively, the dream may refer to a time were you were young and small and thus symbolic of your childhood.   No one would say that I lack self-confidence or self-esteem so I'll have to scratch that one off.  Cave  To dream that you are walking in a dark cave, signifies refuge or the unconscious mind. It also denotes that you experience some unexpected misfortune or disagreement.   A little vague. Who hasn't experienced misoftune or disagreement?  Noise  To hear a strange noise in your dream, signifies the unexpected and the unknown. You may be expressing some fear or confusion concerning a particular situation in your waking life. The noise in your dream may serve as a way to attract your attention to that issue. Alternatively, noise may represent a breakthrough in your personal struggles. Perhaps you have burst through a barrier of resistance which had been holding you back for a long time.   Or maybe I've watched Indiana Jones too many times :)  Darkness  To dream that darkness comes upon you, signifies failure in work you may attempt. Darkness is synonymous with ignorance, the unconscious, evil, death, and fear of the unknown. To dream that you are lost in the darkness, denotes feelings of desperation, depression, or insecurity.   No dream dictionaries have anything with regards to being crushed...very disappointing :(   So, now that you know what you fear, how do you conquer those fears? Or should I save those for another day?",male,27,Technology,Capricorn,0

I've been looking at flights to such places as London (YES MATT, I HAVE LOOKED INTO GOING TO BOMO, STOP ASKING!), as well as the recently announced Canadameet 3.  I have a hidden agenda though by going to Can3...One being visiting other friends and family.  I have scattered friends that have moved from home to venture for work, and it would be nice to finally visit them for a change.  Not to mention, I won't have to convert my canadian play money! w00t!  Anyway, flights from Fredericton are terrible, as many from the area can attest to.  Unless you get to a major airport city like Montreal or Toronto (Maybe Halifax to a lesser extent), you might as well tack on an extra 500/person just to get you there.  TERRIBLE!  So needless to say, here's waiting for a seat sale.  Today was a nice relaxing day at work, for a change.  They've having Employee Appreciation Day for the customer site I work on, and they invited us to join in on the festivities.  Very nice of them to do so I might add.  They just served us catered lunch and I'm stuffffffed.  I guess I'll end here, instead of rambling on my first blog.  So there goes my blogger cherry, and I'll never get it back again :(",male,27,Technology,Capricorn,0

459854,3751152,2004-06-22,"Right.  Let the blogging re-commence (and this time on blogger, so it's officially blogging and not greymattering like before, or something.)  Um, yeah.  I've finally found a free ten minute window to write something down in (although as I say that, here comes my boss to ask some random question...)  Anyway, it's been a hectic few days.  The biggest saga is that my roommate has graduated and is now off to San Francisco in a month for a job.  This leaves me considering options for housing in the near future, with the favorite being to stay in my current place and find a new roommate or two (it's a 3 BR place), but of course this requires either screening random wackos who answer a classified ad, or hunting down people I know who can get out of rental agreements in short order.  Human interaction, of course, is not something that I have any semblance of skill in.  So we'll see where this leads over the next few weeks.  Meanwhile I find myself playing on two crappy soccer teams (and before you ask, they were crappy BEFORE I joined, although I'm not going to help the situation any.)  This would be fine and dandy if it weren't nearly 90F (~32C) outside all week and we actually had subs.  As much as I enjoy running around for 90 minutes at that temperature, there's a point where there's just no more fluid to sweat out.  Hmm.  Maybe I can find a roommate who has an interest in soccer.  Oh, and book your seats now on the Lorax Express to Trail/Fruitvale in October.  We're aiming for new world record times.",male,27,Technology,Capricorn,0
459855,3751152,2004-06-22,"After a long few days of scanning, editing, creating sites and uploading - my pictures page is finally complete.  What did I do thats different?  Well, I basically used one of those thumbnail thingies so its easier for people to glance through them.  The hardest files were the meet photos, but, thankfully, its all done now.  The only thing is that I'm going to have to do still is upload the videos and sort through those.  I haven't quite decided how I'm going to do that so we'll see...  In other news, things are slowly calming down here. I'm starting to feel somewhat better although if it would rain and the heat would go away it would make it a lot easier.  Something about hot weather just makes me feel a bit crankier.  Apparently, we're not expecting and cooler weather till Sunday.  Blah!  I think its just because I hate cooking in such heat as well.  I like to leave things till later on days like these - like last night.  Adam and I walked along the highway to the end of Old Salmo road and walk up it.  It was really dark but so quiet and nice.  Thats the thing about this area though - its a small town and with that you can see almost every star on a clear night.  Thats what our hammock is for.  Late night, backyard cuddling :)  In the coming weeks I also will have the pain of shopping for a bathing suit.  I have no idea what happened to mine from last year (maybe left it at my dad's?) but now I need a new one.  Its a pain because its just impossible to find anything you like in a small town like this.  Well not totally impossible but it requires a lot of time and effort.  Lastly, Adam and I have decided to hold a meet here this coming October.  Surprisingly, we already have some good numbers signing up for it (even with some international people!).  Hopefully it will turn out as great as CAN2 did and with even more people.  We haven't even told all the locals yet so we'll see.

459856,3751152,2004-06-22,"*taps on the screen* Is this thing working? Seems to be, thanks Melia!   So, back to the title. I've heard quite a few people saying something similar today - I guess when it's grey and doesn't stop raining you do have to ask if it really is summer given that it is mid-June. It's only when you realise that Wimbledon started on Monday and you cast your mind back to last year and the year before (and the year before...you get the picture!) that you realise it's the same every year. Here in the UK we've enjoyed some gorgeous weather with temperatures hotter than most of Europe and clear blue skies filled with sun - so we're more than a little pissed off that the annual two weeks of June rain has descended once more.  Hopefully summer - in the form of sun and hot weather - will return once Tim Henman has won Wimbledon and England have won Euro 2004 and we can get back to complaining about how it's far too hot ;) I guess the English are never happy when it comes to the weather...but we wouldn't have it any other way ;)",male,27,Technology,Capricorn,0
459857,3751152,2004-07-30,"So I got the job. Yes I hear everyone I've been pestering for the past couple of weeks with my mounting anxiety breathing a sigh of relief now that they know I won't bug them anymore. Now I shall gratefully accept all of the 'I told you so's and sit back and breathe my own contented sigh of relief.  Mo' money. Mo' vacation time. And to top it off, I can stay on at the hospital on a sort of ""contract"" basis. It's not really contracting, they call it 'pool' status which I guess means I join a pool of employees they can call on to do stuff. But I can transition in whomever takes over my job here, as well as carry on doing the 'outside of my job description' work I do for other departments like Powerpoint storyboards and newsletters etc. So I'll have a small secondary income which will be really nice.  Finally I can begin to dig out of the hole I'm in. It's a shallow hole, I don't have the huge amounts of debt hanging over me that some people have. I have no credit cards, mortgages or anything. I just have your basic, normal bills that somehow amounted to more than I earn currently and have been steadily piling up as I juggle them. But anyway, no more. I am not going to be going on any wild spending sprees now that I'll have a bit more cash flow but I may break down and buy myself a new crockpot :)  Anyway, that's my final update on this whole thing.

459858,3751152,2004-07-29,"I'm all moved into the new place.  Now the fun begins: unpacking!  I hate to clean and put stuff away.  This is probably going to take a while.  Actually the biggest motivator for all of it is trying to find stuff you know you have... somewhere.  Like for the last week I've been wearing tank tops if I go anywhere outside, not only because it's warm outside, but because I have NO IDEA WHERE ALL MY BRAS HAVE GONE.  I actually unpacked a bunch of clothes cause I have to work tomorrow and, well, as much as I've embraced the hippie within, I don't think I can get away bra-less in summer in an office.  For that matter, I dunno if I want to.  I'm covering for a receptionist at a placement agency where they place a lot of factory workers with many social disabilities.  And Friday is payday.  Guess where they'll be?  Maybe I'll just be able to send them off without any sort of problems if I wear a skirt tomorrow. :)  I've spent the last three days coating the hardwood floor in the other unit with polyurethane (takes 24 hours to dry between coats).  Anyway, inevitably, the stuff ends up on me.  Mostly my legs, cause I'm working on hands and kneees, but I got a couple of nice spots on my hands too.  Now, imagine this.  The Minwax polyurethane is largely a clearcoat, but it's got a slightly brownish tinge to it.  Now try to imagine clearcoating your skin with a polymer that'll dry hard ;).  And it doesn't wash off.  It's like superglue.  You have to wait for your skin to wear off, cause if you pick at it it takes your whole dermal layer with it.  It's really frigging hot in here.  I have this nice finished attic, but guess where all the heat in the house goes, naturally :)  Kids, they're not kidding.  Heat DOES rise.  See, you can learn all sorts of useless information at school :)  Anyway, last comic standing is on!  I'm outtie :)",male,27,Technology,Capricorn,0
459859,3751152,2004-07-25,"Hello.   I haven't posted recently, mostly because I've been busy with work and such - these things happen.  At present, my work mainly entails showing grossly over-paid, incredibly neurotic people who have incredibly short attention spans how to accomplish ostensibly simple tasks on the computer.  Unfortunately, these tasks become infinitely more difficult when no one listens to explanations, and no one does.  So, after 8 hours at the office, my time comprised predominately of 20-minute segments in which I explain such computer subtleties as the difference between a ""right click"" and a ""left click,"" I am usually quite ready to jump off a rather large bridge.   Sadly, I don't have the balls.   In other news, I saw a new musical tonight, music and lyrics by Steven Sondheim, starring (and written by) Nathan Lane.  It's a very free adaptation of the Aristophanes Play, ""The Frogs,"" in which Dionysos and his slave Xanthias go to the underworld to try and brimg back a playwright to save mankind.  The original version of the play was laden with political satire and subtle humor, as was Lane's adaptation (for instance, the frogs who attack pre-emptively but then can't remember why they attacked in the first place).  It was sort of funny, but mainly disjointed and all-together not worth the money.  It was fun seeing Nathan Lane 10-feet from my face, I admit, but somehow it wasn't quite as epiphanic (is that a word?) a moment as I had envisioned.   You probably could've done something more productive with the minute it took you to read this post.

459860,3751152,2004-07-25,"So I have my interview on Tuesday morning with the paper and my nerves are beginning to jangle. I haven't done this in several years. I had a phone interview last week that (I thought) went very well after spending a nerve-wracking couple of days waiting for the call. I'm a worrier and I overthink everything. I don't want to, but it just happens. I'd love to be Miss Laidback, everything's cool, no worries. But I'm finding that I am just not that way.  The director set up a phoner with me for ""sometime Tuesday afternoon or anytime Wednesday."" Of course I said I'm available but I wish I would have pushed for a specific time. I'm also maybe a little *too* accomodating. I'm one of those people who will be at your beck and call if I'm needed (in a work situation that is. Don't get any ideas.) So of course I tell her I'm available at her convenience which I've read is not necessarily a good thing. But anyway, I figure it's like picking a jury - it's unpredictable. She may have appreciated me accomodating her, then again maybe she wasn't. See? I'm overthinking it already and it all happened last week.  Anyway, no call on Tuesday and by 4pm Wednesday I'm beginning to panic. What if she hired some else? What if she changed her mind? What do I do if she doesn't call? Do I then have to bother her with a call or email? What if I do that and I end up sounding desperate and annoying? See what I mean? I'm sure I drove poor Cathy (in my office) nuts with my edginess. Thankfully, she called at 4:15 and I figured she was probably just leaving it til the end of the day since she was calling me at work to do this.   The call went well as I said. We talked about the possibilty of moving to another town and whether that would appeal to me. It would if the town were Lincoln or Omaha, but the town she named is crap and I don't want to live there. So she said that was okay, she had positions open here in town as well. Then we went over my experience and what sort of things I'm comfortable working with. She cracked a joke or two, I laughed but kept my joke-making at a minimum. I crack jokes when I'm nervous and they mostly fall flat. Then we set up a time to meet face-to-face and she emailed me the official job description and rang off.  Soooo, I've been purposely keeping my mind off the interview as much as I can all weekend but as the time inches closer, I can feel it in my toes. My skin is tingly, my muscles are tense and my brain's going a million miles an hour. Tomorrow I'll be looking over example interview questions, trying to get a couple of my references to write me something because I'm not sure if I should do that or just provide their names and numbers. All this resume/interview etiquette stuff is doing my head in. I just want the job. The money would be better, the job more interesting and fast-paced, I'd get to work on a team rather than holed up in my little cave on my own working for a company with great people, but ssslllooooww progress and low pay.

Although, this will be my sixth meet, it will be the first in England, and my first trip ever to England.  Somewhat embarassing for me, as I have now been living in Europe for 4 years. So I will have to leave my ""comfort zone"" of German-speaking Europe for that strange uncivilized south coast of England.  I am sure they are no longer running around in purple paint as the Romans found them 2000 years ago or so ;)  Anyways, I feel a lot better now that I have finally gotten a ticket.  I plan to go with my fellow Swiss residents, Reethi and Sunshine, both of which are Bomo veterans and should know how to deal with things unknown to me such as trains that are not on time ;).  Hmm..

I mean, it's gotta be hell working with nekkid women all day huh? The demands on him.

So he's been literally BOUNCING off the walls. He can't be quite for two seconds and made the biggest scene in Meijers. He's back talked me and defied everything I've told him. I've lost track of all the punishments I've given out. From what I can remember, he's grounded thru Sunday. No bicycle, no cd player, no gameboy or xbox and no one will be coming over to play and he's not going anywhere. I called his doctor yesterday to ask her for a refill on his meds. I went and picked it up today and rushed it up to the pharmacist who said, ""Oh ready in 20 minutes"". Thank GOD. Only 20 more minutes of this craziness .... I can do this. 20 minutes later, I rushed back up to the pharmacy to pick up the presciption only for them to say ""We called the doctor to make sure we could give him the generic and they said sure HOWEVER the prescription is written for tomorrow and she wouldn't ok it for today"". WHAT THE F***!?!?!?!?!?! Does she KNOW the day I've had?? Does she not UNDERSTAND what a parent goes through??? OMFG.  All of this on top of the stupid Dodge dealership was supposed to install our dvd player in our car this morning. I called them at 830 this morning to make sure we were still on to bring the car in. Well, no, apparently the guy didn't write the appointment down in the books. SO, no one knew what was going on. They were also supposed to give us an extra key and a driver's manual. The guy said he was going to have to order the dvd player to match our interior and no one could tell me anything about it. So, Dave (the guy I spoke to on the phone), said he'd call me riiiight back and let me know what was going on (remember this is 830) Two hours later and 3 phone calls back to them, he told me to call back at 2 and speak to Jamie (great another Jamie problem to deal with).  I told Dave that I was not happy and that we've never had anything go smooth with any of the Thomas Dealerships (Kia or Dodge) and that it was always a huge hassle. I told him that he'd better be glad I called up there before I came, because had I come up there and had to sit with 3 kids, they would have had a VERY unhappy female on their hands---poor guy had no idea what to say... Anyway, yeah, so 2 o'clock rolls on and I call the dealership. I had about a 5 minute run around with the girl who answers saying that Jamie would just end up transferring me back to her anyway, so I mine as well talk to her.

I asked him why he didn't tell me that and why did he say that they'd have to order it? He never gave me a direct answer but played it off like it was me who was the idiot for not going in.  *deep breathes* SOOOoooo, we will be trying this again on Thursday.

459865,3751152,2004-07-19,"Well, what to rant about first?  My weekend was one of complete ups and downs.   Starting off with last Friday.  I got to work, called Aliant to find out what was going on and low and behold, they'd fixed all my phone bill problems!  That's a big woo hoo!  Then some good stuff happened here at work regarding some bad stuff that had gone on last week.  I wasn't directly involved, but part of my job was.  But they got it all fixed.  I got some major praise from my boss on a letter regarding a union raise, which I luckily get.  But on top of that letter, was a little note from some anonymous person, which read ""Thank you for being so helpful and patient with my computer problems.  You show so much more patience than some of your fellow staff members.""  I felt really good that people appreciate that I try to be friendly with everyone and as patient as possible.  The day whiddled on and I got some work done, working with Scott most of the morning and some of the afternoon.  When 4:30 rolled around, I was quite pumped and excited.  Scott and I rolled out, to head to the 'pop shop' to grab some beverages for the small trip we were going on this weekend.    On arrival in the parking lot, Scott's cell rang, with Sue telling Scott to tell me to call home asap.  That's when I found out my Grandmother Cameron had passed away peacefully in her sleep.  She had been running a temperature of 38 degrees or more most all of last Friday.  My parents had been called up to sit with her at 5am that day.  So my 'high' came to a crashing end.  We had had plans to do a lot of stuff on the weekend and I was unsure of what to do.  My parents only had a minute to talk, because they had appointments to keep.  So I was left sitting on the outside looking in for the next 2 hours while I awaited their return home.   Scott, Sue and I, along with some other friends, had plans to see a musical performance that night, called Good Vibrations, and I really wanted to go to meet a few of the other people (all girls, of only one which I was interested in meeting).  So when my parents and I talked, we decided that I would not go home for the funeral.  And after talking some more, my Mom broke down.  And much to my chagrin, I had to break down and tell her that since my plans for B10 had fallen through, that I was coming home on August 2nd.  That cheered her up very much and made my night.  So off to the performance I went, met some new friends and enjoyed the 3 hours of live folk music covers!   Saturday, Scott, Sue and I were up and away for the fireworks display in the Crows Nest Pass called ""Thunder in the Valley"", which is in the valley of the mountains.  Along on our trip, was Amanada, who had been out with us the night before and going to see the fireworks with Susan and friends from work.  We had an interesting day, enjoyed the fireworks and had a really great time.  I was totally doing my own personal celebration of my Grandmother's life, totally enhaling liquor like it was going out of style.  I apparently was described as a cute cuddly bear, a total riot, and that crazy guy from down East.  I'm glad I kept everyone quite amused and that only Scott, Sue and Katherine (Sue's friend from work, who's parents house we were all staying) knew that I was kinda in the dumps.  I had a great time and enjoyed myself, even if some engaged beaver somehow found it's way out that night.  I had mentioned to a couple of other people that night what had happened, but only the people who I knew a bit better and was comfortable talking to, like Katherine's bf, Lucas and Amanda, who was quickly becoming a friend.  She's from 'down East' too and was a nice reminder of home for me.   Sunday we came back, I talked to my parents several times throughout the day about the wake and how things went.  It's suprising that close to 300 people went to an old woman's wake.  My parents were so happy to see friends, family and people come to give their condolances for an 'old woman' that people had probably forgotten about.   Monday, I took a bereavement day and waited patiently by the phone (as in I slept) until my mother called to let me know that the funeral had gone ok and that the Minister and a family friend had done a beautiful job with the service and the eulogy respectively.    Today, I'm back to work, and things are starting to sink in.  I've always been the 'rock' in my family.  The one who can bottle it all up, until after everyone is ok and things are settled.  Then I have my break down.  I'm sure in the next day or two, it will come at some inopportune time and I'll feel like a jackass.  Only management and my co-workers know what happened.   But on a perky note, I'm feeling much better now that I've spammed you all with lots of useless crap, that most of you will have known or not and that it's all off of my chest.  So I will be blogging again soon, but until then,   Tune in next time, same Bat-time, same Bat-channel!",male,27,Technology,Capricorn,0
459866,3751152,2004-07-19,"I hate diets. I've always hated dieting. I love to eat, LOVE to eat. My fridge is stocked, I have a separate freezer to hold the mounds of steaks and chicken breasts I eat. I even took culinary classes in college to learn how to cook better.   On the same note I love health and fitness. I run about 30-35 miles a week, I lift weights an hour a day and I do strenuous stretching three times a day.   On a third note I hate doctors and I hate going to the doctor. I've well known as someone who gives doctors and nurses a hard time and I'm generally difficult to perform the simplist checkup.   So needless to say last week I'm in the doctor's office and the nurse (god bless her) is getting a usual earful from me about why she's doing this and I'm paying the doctor when all he does it come in and give me a pat on the shoulder before telling me to come back in six months. She smiles because she knows I really give him a hard time about doing the things mentioned above and getting paid large sums for this.   Anyway, I step on the scale and it reads 246, around 15 pounds above my weight. 15 Pounds!...Well the scale must surely be broken and I'm not level the office until I get a second reading from another scale...Hmm 246 again...I go to one of the supermarket scales and it's 246...Sonofabitch...246 pounds...Well I don't feel any different, I don't look any different and my clothes fit the same...So what the fuck?   Well apparently I'm getting older and my eating habits are that of Corey at 24 instead of Corey at (soon to be) 29. So I was told to research my eating routine for the last 10 years and examine how much it changed.   Most people don't have a documented eating routine from 10 or more years but doc knows that I used to play college football (actually I got a scholarship for playing college football and flamed out with a knee problem) and I saved my eating plan from that and actually reduced my food intake based on that chart about six years ago.   So for the end of part one, I'm going to give you my eating schedule when I was 18 years old at the University of Tennessee, where I was on scholarship to play football. Now the football program had a group of nutrition and health workers to keep us on our schedule six days a week (Sunday was an official junk food day)...The food intake is borderline scary but be reminded that it was made for me to gain about 25-30 pounds and get from my high school weight of about 215 to the weight of a football linebacker...So here was Corey's daily schedule as taken from my file (I'd scan it but my scanner ain't cooperating)     6:30 a.m.  Voluntary Cardio workout   7:10 a.m.  Weight training   8:00 a.m.  Breakfast (Mushroom omelet of 6 eggs (4 eggs whites, two full eggs) side of potatoes or grits, two slices of wheat toast, one glass OJ, one glass skim milk, and as much water as he wants; Three days a week I had mushroom, three days a week I had a cheese omelet and a side of turkey bacon).   9:00 a.m. I think I had a class...or an angioplasm...   10:00 a.m.  Mid-Morning snack (Oatmeal with banana, strawberries, brown sugar, and milk).   11:00 a.m. Probably had a class...or went to the bathroom.   12:30 p.m. Mandatory cardio workout (yay, running in 95 degree Tennessee heat)   1:00 p.m. Lunch (Two sandwiches [usually turkey, tuna or roast beef for me] and two bowls of fruit and at least two glasses of water)   2:00 p.m. Probably had a class [My class schedule ended at about 3 every day]   3:15 p.m. Specialized health shake (Usually some blueberry, banana, honey mix with too much protein powder)   3:30 p.m. Practice   6:30 p.m. Dinner (Two grilled chicken breasts (or a big steak/prime rib if I was lucky), two baked potatos, two vegetables, some sort of bread. At least two glasses of water and a glass of icea tea: On two days I'd usually have a heavy dose of pasta and salad).    9:00 p.m. Late Evening snack (Usually a couple bowls of fruit)   Okay that was what I was forced at 18...In Part 2, I'll tell you about my necessary diet and my high cholesterol (SURPRISE!)",male,27,Technology,Capricorn,0
459867,3751152,2004-07-19,"I usually am a strong opponent of tobacco. I really don't like the stuff.  As a teen, I did try a few cigarettes under peer pressure, but only as in the Bill Clinton ""didn't inhale"" style.  Tonight, I ran into my first new experience with tobacco in many a year.     After work, I sometimes go to a pool hall where I will play a few games and talk to people.  Tonight, after a few games, the people I were with pulled out a small can and began doing their ritual of pouring two spots of powder onto the back of their hands.  This powder was snuff. I have seen them do it before, but have refused to take part in it before.  Before, I could say anygthing, somebody had already poured it onto the back of my hand and I realized I was in this round.  Oh well..I have always learned, as was the case with alcohol, if you just do it once, people will get their kick watching you do it and then will leave you alone.  So I decided to do the snort and just get it over with.   To my surprise, it was nothing like tobacco, but rather more like a ""Fisherman's Friend"" backed up into your nose or a Vick's inhaler.  Very strong methol rush.  I even agreed to one more later in the evening.  Hopefully, I am not addicted ;)   As for web links, I won't bore you with details, but a few that I visit regularly include    urlLink http://www.google.com  - I like the news summaries here as there is always more than one version of the story.    urlLink http://www.cnn.com  - A fast roundup of the news, but usually they have a headline dealing with Iraq which is a real turnoff to me.    urlLink http://www.cinescape.com  - A sci fi /fantasy movie and tv website done by the publishers of the magazine of the same name.    urlLink http://www.trektoday.com  - A daily roundup of all the latest Star Trek news.   Nothing too much more interesting to post!",male,27,Technology,Capricorn,0
459868,3751152,2004-07-16,"Welcome to the second edition of ""Adventures with Kitties"" starring Tigger as ""Little Bastard"" and Pooh as ""Little Bitch""!    In today's episode, it is early Monday morning and I've just gotten out of the shower. As I am applying moisturizer to my skin I hear some strange sounds coming from the living room. I walk towards the sounds and immediately see Tigger sitting up on the ledge looking down at the front door. At what? I have no clue. Its obviously a cat thing.    I walk a bit further in and see that the cover is off one of the heating vents on the floor near the living room window. My first thought is ""Crap, Pooh is in the vents!"" so I walk over, remove the whole thing and start calling to her. I hear nothing. I'm wondering what to do and I consider getting the catnip as bait for her. I replace the cover for the vent because god knows Tigger would certainly climb in (he's done it before). I turn around and, to my surprise and amusement, there is Pooh outside at the back door meowing to get in.     I let her in but I'm a bit puzzled as to how she even got out there. As far as I'm aware, I don't think the vents lead outside - at least not that quickly/directly. The only other option I can think of is that she went through the living room window. See, we don't have a screen on that window just yet - and last night I left it slightly open so as to let in the cool night air. The thing is that it wasn't open any more than 3 inches but maybe thats enough. If she did escape that way she had quick the long drop down!    Cats are just weird.  Or maybe thats just our cats :)    Anyhoo, today I feel normal. And what I mean by that is that we went to a wedding this weekend and I got really nicely toasted - so I'm now feeling non-alcoholic and, thus, normal. Its been quite some time since I had that much wine - and it wasn't even all that much! I guess we've got to get into ""condition"" before Canadameet though! ;)    So now Adam and I are thinking of doing something for the long weekend in August - but we're not sure just what yet. Maybe camping? We might just go back to Sullivan Lake or maybe do something else. Suggestions anyone? It has to be something close to here as we're trying to save $$ to renovate our upstairs bathroom.    But now I must get ready for work... Ciao!",male,27,Technology,Capricorn,0

Contains sequence for practically every organism that has any DNA sequenced, protein sequences, scientific journal references, etc.  urlLink  Entrez-Pubmed  @ NCBI - The Google of biomedical scientific journal article references. Handy for when you want to look up if anyone has studied the effects of excessive internet usage on brain tumor formation.    Well, work's boring.

If I was able to get Fire hooked, I can get you hooked as well.   urlLink KEXP 90.3  - A local independent music station that's almost entirely listener-supported. The breadth and depth of this station are almost beyond words, and their website is a work of art. They have shows ranging from indie rock to jazz to reggae to African beats to electronica to rockabilly. They offer live streaming of all their broadcasts in numerous formats (including 1.4 mbps uncompressed!), a two-week streaming archive of all shows and permanent archives of the numerous artists who appear and do in-studio performances.

I'm always a little wary when people ask for my bookmarks because...well frankly not everything I see I want to share.   However I like most of you so I'll oblige with just a few of my favorite daily stops. Now just so you know I'm a news guy, I'm a sports news guy and most of my day revolves around my career, which comes through in my links.    Newspapers:  All the news that's fit to print.    urlLink The New York Times:  The gray old lady is still going strong. I usually hit the front pages and the Arts section after I get up and wash my face. Occasionally I'll check sports if Bill Rhoden has a column or Chris Broussard has a notebook but usually I check sports at...     urlLink Newsday:   Newsday is the only other non-tabloid in the New York Metro area (they are based out of Long Island). The  urlLink New York Daily News  and  urlLink New York Post  are the most famous tabloids in the world excluding Europe. The Newsday gives me the information I need on the Mets, Jets, and Islanders. A lot of the baseball stuff is reaching as the Times has all the good baseball writers, but they try. And also they are the best source for anything Amy Fisher.     urlLink The Ledger:   It's the local paper. I'm pissed because they still aren't sure if they are going to pick up my column and at times the stories are so single-focused that anyone outside of Central Florida couldn't relate. However a lot of my friends work here and they are good people.     urlLink St. Petersburg Times:   St. Pete used to be the best in Florida but now they are merely the best in the Tampa Bay area. Excellent features and business section.     urlLink Knight-Ridder Election Coverage:   This is links to all things 2004 election from the Knight-Ridder group of papers (Miami Herald, Philly Inquirer, etc.). They should be getting active in the next few weeks with the conventions kicking up.     News-Based Websites:  All the news that's 90% correct half the time.    urlLink  CNN:   Cable News Network is still the best and most respected in the business. It's not quirky and tacky like FOX but CNN doesn't employ Sean Hannity and that's a good thing.    urlLink  Google News:   I prefer this over Yahoo because they link wire and newsprint stories (which are usually copies of the wire story). And it's separated by topics. For Google updates you can check the unofficial  urlLink  Google weblog  .    urlLink The Smoking Gun:   The gun is as good as anyone in finding the great odd police blotters. It's where I found much of my material in the Debra Lafave sexual assault case.     Sports:  It's what I'm all about.     urlLink ESPN:   It's chicken soup for the sports lovers' soul. They are roughly three minutes faster on breaking sports news than the Associated Press because AP has to get clearance from their National Wire Editor before posting a bulletin.    urlLink  CBS Sportsline:   Not as good as ESPN but they have many more free options and a free rumor mill, the little things that ESPN makes one pay an insider fee for.     urlLink Sporting Fools:   This is my site that I run with AP Writer Mike Branom. We'll throw some current sports news up there and occasionally relay our opinions.     urlLink  Ralph Wiley:   One of the best sports/culture writers of my generation. Wiley passed away in June, a week before I would be able to see him. I can read his ESPN.com archives here.     urlLink  Bill Simmons:   Bill Simmons, once known as the Boston Sports Guy, is part sports, part entertainment. One of the last remaining NBA fans on earth and he enjoys The Karate Kid and gambling as much as I do. ESPN.com finally gave him his own page.     Entertainment:  Because Man Can't Live on News and Sports alone.      urlLink Electablog:   The best political blog on the net. It's run by Dave Pell and it's a cross between The Daily Show and Hardball. Excellent stuff.     urlLink Drudge Report:   I can't call this news because Matt Drudge is a Bush-flag waving jackass who can't break a story for shit. Despite Matt's pathetic attempts at being a journalist (all the while being an hourly insult to those of us who work hard in the profession) some things on his site are pretty funny. I take him with a grain of salt.     urlLink IMDB:   Whenever I'll looking to see if my proposed Billy Zabka/Frank Stallone/Charlie Sheen movie project will ever come to fruition. I look here.     urlLink College Football News:   I really can't call this sports because it's a fan site. However it's got Fox's backing and the webmaster is writing stuff in The Sporting News on the side. Overall it's a very impressive fan site dedicated to college football.     urlLink Soul Sides :  GREAT Audioblogger for the obscure lover of Hip-Hop, Soul, R&B, Jazz and anything cultural from this era and the older days.     urlLink Whiskey Bar:   Political discussion disguised as bar discussion. Billmon was a lot more fun until he got caught up in the fraud known as the Bush Administration.     urlLink Warchant:   When I want to discuss the athletics of the greatest school on earth -- Florida State University (Nah, I'm not bias).     urlLink Talk Left -- The Politics of Crime:   All things for the bleeding heart liberal in all of us.     urlLink Air America Radio:   All things for the bleeding heart liberal in all of us, but who's too lazy to read the words on Talk Left.     urlLink Blog Maverick:   Mark Cuban's weblog. Cuban is a self-made billionaire and the owner of the NBA's Dallas Mavericks franchise. His tips on business skills are often useful.       Games:  You all know, I play a little.    urlLink  Joystiq:   It's all about the video games here. Updates on new games, new systems, some demo shots.     urlLink  XBox 2:   Unofficial weblog for the upcoming Microsoft system. I am an XBox owner and it is the greatest video game system on earth. I will not argue this. However if you perfer...    urlLink  Playstation 3:   ...that buggy, slow crap from Sony. I like to read up on the enemy as well. Generally these two weblogs have similar information.      Travel:  /o~/I'm an everywhere man...I'm an everywhere man../o~/    urlLink  Cheapo Vegas:   If you know me, you know I love Las Vegas. I've actually been able to call my last few Vegas trips work as I've covered boxing events there. Cheapo Vegas is a funny, informative site that gives you the real dirt on all the hotel/casinos in Sin City.     urlLink  Las Vegas Advisor:   This is Anthony Curtis' tip site. I pay the few bucks a month to get an actual newsletter because they include many deals and coupons. I actually stayed at Mandalay Bay for $59/night one time thanks to a secret deal uncovered by Curtis. The free site is fine, check out the top 10 deals.   That's about all I look at everyday.

Some decent nerdly stuff comes out occasionally though.      urlLink Spiderfan.org  is probably the best compendium of Spiderman related information anywhere.      urlLink Gamespot , full of reviews, previews and information on any kind of game you can think of.

They recently got a whack load of money to do a feasibility study to see how much of a sucker local governments are (Ok, I mean to say they got money to study whether or not their business plan is feasible...talk about a loaded study, what are they going to say, ""No, this is impossible, you'd waste your money on us if we did this"")      urlLink Doug Alders Blog  is an old boss of mine that writes his conspiracy theories and complains about being old. I like reading it just to think I'll never be that bitter :)      urlLink Belt0033's Blog  is a boob. Plain and simple. An idiot who thinks he's smarter then he really is.     This one, I like TCZ      Community:         urlLink Conservatism  is full of people who espouse how great Bush is and how dumb Democrats/Liberals are.

Incredibly intelligent man, always right, etc etc.      urlLink The Drudge Report  is run by Matt Drudge, an internet muck-raker who is more often more wrong then right.      urlLink Media Matters  takes words spoken by Rush Limbaugh, Bill O'reilly and Fox News and unspins it with information backed up with facts. Rush and Bill both respond with the ""left wing conspiracy"" that is Media Matters      urlLink Fox News  is fair and balanced      urlLink Canada.com  is chock full of information about how much Canadians hate the US, how much the war in Iraq is failing, how ahead of the polls is Kerry against Bush, oh, and sometimes they mention Canada.      urlLink Bowling For Truth  is the Anti-Michael Moore site that started it all. Takes everything said in Bowling for Columbine and attempts to explain it away.      urlLink Yahoo News  is good for new information coming off the newswire. The message boards attached to a story are pretty entertaining too.      urlLink BBC  is some kind of news show.      Comics:       urlLink Penny Arcade  pretends to be edgy, but all they come across as is big fat angsty computer nerds who occasionally do really good deeds (like getting their community to donate video games to sick kids). Sometimes funny, sometimes sad, they're based in Spokane WA, which is just across the border from us.      urlLink Sluggy Freelance  is THE webcomic. There is no match. Excellent art, awesome lorax humour. Worship the Comic. (The only webcomic I'd pay to get in hardcopy form)       urlLink It's Walky , which is quickly coming to a close (The author is killing off all the characters to start a new series) was pretty good for a teen angst with superpowers kind of dealio. Then he got bored      urlLink PVP Online  has it all. Computer nerd, fat boss, 30-something hippy, two fat ex-jocks..All in comic form. Art is really good (although it's just copy and paste of various poses that have been drawn before). Quite funny and pretty fresh.      urlLink User Friendly  is everything PVP isn't. The art is crap; it's boring, repetitive and overly nerdy. Used to be a big thing back when everyone hated Microsoft (The whole comic is basically office culture and nerd humor, much like PVP). Most people don't like User Friendly anymore, but I used to work with a couple of these guys, so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt.      urlLink College Roomies from Hell  is drawn by a chick, and is basically the same plot line of It's Walky. Teen angst with superpowers.      urlLink Sinfest  is the edgy comic that Penny Arcade wants to be. Deals with god, satan, sluts, presidents, ninjas, pigs and overbearing Christian parishioners. Love it.      urlLink Cagle's Political Cartoons  is a compendium of various newspaper artists who do political satire comics.

459873,3751152,2004-07-15,"So last night I'm in bed reading a book when I hear Tigger start to howl really loud.  I don't get up immediately because he's done that before just to annoy me, but then after the second howl I hear this kind of squeaking sound.  I pause and listen wondering what the heck it could be and then it comes to me that maybe he caught a mouse.  I get up, he's still meowing, and walk into the hall and there is this poor cute little bird!!!    I couldn't believe it.  He actually caught a bird - the poor thing.  I felt so bad yet wanted to also laugh at the cat.  He didn't really hurt it - so it seemed.  I mean, there were a few feathers out and it seemed unable to fly away right away but it also looked like it was completely in shock.  I walk over to the bird and call Adam up from downstairs and Tigger starts meowing all cutely and trying to poke at the bird as if to say ""Like the present I brought you?""  So we shoo him away and Adam picks up the bird and we bring it out to the backyard.  What do you do with birds in this instance anyways? Its not like we had a birdcage lying around and could look after it.  We bring it out back and I try to check out its wing - nothing seems to be wrong (no blood).  It chirps, leaps out of Adam's hand and goes under the rhododendron bush.  We figured it well-covered under there, make sure the cats are in and leave it to calm down/sort itself out.    I'm still amazed that that evil little fat bastard caught a bird.  If anything, I thought I'd have a mouse on my floor before a bird but I guess I underestimated him.  What I'm really curious about is how he got it into the house.  I mean if he caught it outside he would have had to put it down, then open the screen door (as I had closed it), then pick it up again and bring it in the house.  Strange & slightly talented kitty.  I blame Beanie - he picked the cat out!!    No worries though - I'm assuming the bird survived and is well - I checked under the bush this morning and it was nowhere to be seen.  I hope it was only in shock and recovered and flew away.  Stupid cat won't even eat chicken cat food and he goes after a bird... sheesh.

Last night I finally came to the decision that I'm going to start going again, and so today I pootled down to the gym for a quick session on the cross-trainer and some sit-ups.   I've also gone so far as to book a gym induction session - the third one I have booked now, I just hope I actually get a training programme this time. The first time, I got told they wouldn't give me a programme until my chiropractor had signed some form saying it was ok for me to use the gym. The second time, the instructor cancelled, but I never got the message so ended up with another wasted visit. I'm hoping it's third time lucky!  So next week I'm planning on going to the gym and perhaps taking some classes in an attempt to start getting fit again. My plan to walk to and from work every day has been scuppered by the British summer - or rather the lack of it. A little old lady at the bus stop even asked me where the summer had gone and that she'd never known a summer like it. Personally, I think it's my fault. I've bought a few skirts recently and I guess the sun has decided it doesn't want me exposing my legs so has hidden until I give up the insane notion of wearing skirts :( It's not that I'm not a skirt person, it's just that I generally wear jeans. My mum always makes the comment ""oh, you DO have legs then"" whenever I wear a skirt, that's how rare it is. But my problem has not been a hatred for skirts, more a case of not finding a nice skirt, and now I have - about 4 of them! The next problem is finding shoes I can wear with them. Not sure trainers are going to match all my skirts...",male,27,Technology,Capricorn,0

I don't like being in a bad mood because I'm such an easy going soul (almost too easy going if you ask some).   I'm really not going to go into why work sucked today because no one wants to read that. Instead I'll talk about why work is going to suck tomorrow. Well, I can't really do that with a clear mind because I want to think tomorrow will be a better day. I'm optimistic like that.   I already feel like I'm in the busy season. I haven't returned any of my friends' phone calls this week. I'm playing phone tag with a potential dating prospect and I'm working 12 hour mid-week days. This is not good and it doesn't bode well for the fall when things actually go live. I've said this before but I mean it this time, this is my last football season working. I'm going to try to switch over to baseball or something. The pre-season rush to do football previews is taxing. Baseball is more consistent and the travel is much better (albeit frequent).

So here I am at 26 (almost 27!) and I'm none of those. I have an obscure job title (Learning Technologies Support Officer) and do a job that people don't really understand so they just say I work in IT.

So after 3 hours of talking to my boss I have a job description that matches what I do and a list of objectives that I can work on over the coming months. But one thing bugs me, much as I like my job, is it what I want to be doing in a year, 5 years, 10 years...?

The interesting thing about our latest group is that they are all women- quite an abnormality for engineering.  The three women are quite different.  2 Austrians and 1 Swede.  One is blonde (the Swede), one is brown-haired, and one is blue-haired!  The latter is quite unusual for engineering!  So now, my office, which has until this year, been ""male-only"", suddenly has more women than it does men!  Now, you would think with a bunch of women, the stereo type would be that the women would be talking non-stop with each other, and I would be able to get no work done, but these women barely talk to each other.  I took them to lunch today, and barely a word out of any of them to the other...I hope the ice eventually melts between them.  Its also interesting noting the differences in how they behave.  The Swedish woman feels much more comfortable in talking to me that the Austrian women - she also eats much more but is the thinnest.  I have yet to see the Austrian women have more than a simple cup of soup for lunch.    With one of the Austrians, I could not even get a smile from her. So I had to resort to desperate measures and blackmail her with ---- Gummi cola bottles!

Well it's not that, the new job would be the same as the one I have now. Same hours and all. I work 8am-4.30pm M-F and I have evenings and weekends with my daughter (well, plus I talk to her all day online during the summer. During the winter she's in school anyway.) So essentially I'd be doing the same job, same hours, for much more pay. My hangup is my loyalty to the hospital I work for. I love it here. But then, the opportunities for advancement and/or transferring to other parts of the country are better with the new job.   Anyway I appreciate everyone's input and I have followed some advice and taken on board other advice and looked at all my options. Today I spoke with my current boss about it because he the kind of approachable boss who has his employees' best interests at heart and he basically told me that the hospital would hate to see me go, but his advice was that I have to do what's best for me and my daughter, and if it means a change, it means a change. He said I shouldn't feel bad about leaving the hospital because you have to go where the opportunities are.  So I feel a hell of a lot better today. More optomistic at my chances to improve my life and my daughter's life. Thanks to everyone who's given me encouragement and advice on this.

I like the people I work with, I love having my own office and I actually don't mind working for a large Catholic hospital.  My dilemma is that a job has opened up with my city's newspaper that is essentially the same job I have now, but it pays more. Close to 10k a year more. I wouldn't be living the high life, but I'd be a hell of a lot better off than I am now. I wouldn't have to scrounge for dimes and nickels to put a gallon or two of gas in my car. Ok maybe I exaggerate a little, but I am quite often strapped for cash and I'm approaching the time in my life where I shouldn't be anymore.  Next year I'll be vested at the hospital. My insurance is great. My boss is so easygoing I'm able to bring my daughter to work with me now and then and she can hang out in my office, or during summer holidays, my boss allows me to work from home one day a week so that she won't have to stay home alone as much. My paid time off accrues quickly, and if I'm sick, it's not a federal case if I miss a day. The boss and upper management of the hospital love me and have told me I have complete job security because no one else can do what I do.  If it wasn't for the pesky crappy payscale, I'd be even happier.   The job at the newspaper pays more, but I'd be working for Morris Communications which my mother has worked for and wasn't all that chuffed with. I don't have any idea what their health plan is, I'd probably lose having my own office... But the pay... :(  I can't decide if I should apply and face either rejection or having to tell my hospital I'm leaving, slyly let my current boss know I'm applying for that position in the hopes that they'd be desperate to keep me and bump my pay (which will never happen as in order to bump pay, Human Resources has to do a salary survey, management engineering would have to do a feasibility survey, and then they'd have to get a budget increase past Admin Council who are notoriously tight.

Then when there was an unexpected pause to be filled during the meeting, I was asked to give a presentation I had not prepared for...I managed to wing it of course.  At least spending the day in the meeting brought about an invitation to go to dinner with our guests from Italy. Only problem is I left my Passport back in Switzerland.  Now I don't need a passport to get from Switzerland where I live to Liechtenstein where I work, but I do need one to get to Austria where dinner was to be had.

I was out walking and I wanted to go to 7/11.   I crossed the street and some guy was there and it went something like...  Guy: Where are you going? Me: 7/11 Guy: Oh, well it looks a little dark Me: Thats odd for a 24-hour store...  Then the guy looks at me, jumps me and tell me he is going to rape me.  So I'm freaking out and totally struggling against him and trying to scream but I don't seem to have a voice.  We end up wrestling down the street or something and I finally get this string to choke him but I still can't scream and people are just walking by doing nothing.

Let's see what the dream dictionary (www.swoon.com) has to say about this:   Rape : Whatever form it took in your dream, this act is a warning to avoid loose companions or careless behavior that could seriously damage your reputation by giving a false impression to those whose opinions are important to your welfare.    Fight : The basic meaning in a dream of fighting is change. For a business person, it signifies a change of enterprise; for an employed person, a change of job, etc. The degree of success or failure you may expect from the change was forecast in the outcome of your dreamed fight. If your dream concerned others fighting, it is a warning against waste of time and money in idle pleasure.   Laryngitis : To dream of losing your voice is a warning not to gamble or take any unnecessary risk for the next few weeks.  Well isn't that fun?  Sounds like a lot of warnings and a big flag that change is coming.  Whee!  Tell me something I  don't  know.  Stuff, bye.",male,27,Technology,Capricorn,0

Tell one thing that happened to you in that year (if you grab a coin with a year before you were born find another one :) ). : Great I picked up a quarter made from 1965. Hmmm...nothing happened to me in 1965 because I was 10 years away from being conceived. However my mom said she got a job in New York City with the phone company in 1965 and my dad was smoking hashish while working on his thesis at Penn. Works for me.   What comes to mind first when you hear the word ""reality""? Why? : My job. Working at a newspaper is instant reality. If I'm feeling too good I read the AP wire and hear about an explosion in Jerusalem, a beheading in Afghanistan and the war breaking out in central Africa. That's my often changing reality.   What is the most honest thing you have done? : I told one of the editors that I was embarassed about a story that ran on our front page. And she proceeded to include it in the weekly newsletter. Of course the girl who wrote the story cried and I looked like an ass. I apologized but that was a lie because I meant every word I said in the criticism.   What do you like to do most with a free hour? Why? : Maybe take a run on the beach with Metro and Boozer (my dogs).   If you could smash one thing and one thing only, what would you smash? Why? : A stack of Toby Keith CDs.    For what do you think you would be willing to lay down your life? Why? : My family, my ex-fiancee and my professional reputation.

Unfortunately, I have to start work monday, which is simultaneously awesome and a bummer: awesome because I'll be getting money and I won't be broke, a bummer because I don't want to go to work.  But as much as I wish money would just pop out of my ears or something whenever I need it, it doesn't (nor does it pop out of my parents' pockets, ahem), so that leaves me to try and scrounge up my own cash. Bah.  Yesterday I read a memoir by Augusten Burroughs about the first sixteen years of his life and how he spent it living with a psychotic mother who then pawned him off on her crazy psychiatrist who ran a makeshift mental hospital from his beaten old victorian house, all the while engaging in an intense sexual relationship with a man more than twice his age.  The book is called  Running with Scissors , it's a good story and a quick read so I'd reccomend it (it's certainly one of the best memoirs that I've ever read, as the genre is by and large pretty boring and dry).  I also saw both Fahrenheit 9/11 and Spider-Man 2 recently (rather appropriately, I saw the former on July 4th!) and liked both of them.  Moore succeeds in making a really excellent propaganda film and luckily it's my propaganda so I'm happy to see it!  Although really, the important thing is that people go to see it and start actually  thinking  about the political situation rather than just blindly following or ignoring it all together, and I think Moore's film definitely does provoke thought.  The one problem I had with it is that I thought he critisized too many people, which I felt lessened the overall effectiveness of the film.  Focused critisizm is really important when making a statement, and it's one of the things that activists in general seem to have a hard time with (e.g., it can't just be anti-war, it has to be anti-war, anti-racism, anti-poverty, etc.). Spider-Man 2 was fun, just what I'd expect from the sequel to a movie based on a comic book.  Such has been my boring life of late.",male,27,Technology,Capricorn,0

Whereas people in the USA are often asked to move their vacation to another time, in Europe vacation is sacred. So sacred that entire companies will close for weeks at a time so that all their employees can take vacation at the same time.  Now of course July and August are the favorite times for vacation.  This can be a great inconvenience if one does not have vacation him or herself during this time period and relies on other companies that do shut down for vacation to get work done.  Thus was the case for me. I find myself under pressure to prepare numerous steel samples for some experiments.  I have the samples cut at a laser company and I find that this company closes in the middle of July for 3 weeks..so I realize I had better get all these samples cut before they go on vacation. NOw to cut the steel, I first need the steel and I realize the guy who is going to get me the steel is going on for a month's vacation starting at the end of this week. Hence, I made a desperate dash today to pickup steel at the other end of Switzerland before his vacation began.

459889,3751152,2004-07-07,"There are a number of things I'm seeing that sort of weird me out. On a few American cable networks, they've tried to enhance the viewer's movie-viewing experience with a separate 'show' that airs during commerical breaks. Sometimes it works, and sometimes you're left going, 'WTF?'  I was watching 'Die Hard' last night on F/X and it was one of those 'DVD on TV' type things where we have 'hosts' (male and female) to talk about the film during commercial breaks. I think TBS' Dinner and a Movie started this trend and sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. DVD on TV is cool because they show a lot of deleted scenes and extras from a particular movie as it plays out and sometimes they come out with little tidbits about the film that aren't even on the DVD. I think that's cool.  Dinner and a Movie on TBS... sort of works because the phrasing goes together and has been around for a while, if you know what I mean. People have been going out for dinner followed by a movie for years. The format of this is a couple of hosts (again, male and a female) prepare a meal, usually one that's got a clever name related to the film they're showing, during the commercial breaks. There's witty banter, sometimes a guest chef or maybe even a no-name supporting actor who never really made it big.  This is all fine and dandy. But Movie and a Makeover? I think that's on Lifetime or Oxygen or something, but the hosts - yet again a male and female - 'makeover' someone, or something, like a room, during the breaks. What the hell? That's an odd combination.  And why always a male and female host? Covering their bases? Why - and this is what I really wanted to blog about - why is it always a dorky and/or dumpy guy and a hot girl? That's the weirdest trend I've seen lately and I've seen comments and articles about it. The hosts of DVD on TV consist of a hot blonde chick and a geek she wouldn't be caught dead with in a club. Why can't the guy be hot as well? Or better yet, hot guy, dumpy woman. Ok maybe not necessarily dumpy, though I'd have no objections about that, but at least a more realistic, natural woman instead of a tower of silicone, with a fake-bake tan and voluminous blonde hair.  Then there's the sitcom 'According to Jim' - Jim Belushi and... Courtney Thorne-Smith? Eh? I suppose the question is, are the execs at the Networks trying to help break down the stereotype of beautiful women only seeing beautiful men? Or is it just more like wishful thinking on their parts? You know those execs are all short, squat, George Costanza types dreaming of dating the hot chicks :) If they can't get one, they create a show that they can live vicariously through.  Now, don't get me wrong (and here's me covering *my* bases), I think it's great to have a TV show like Belushi's that breaks the stereotypes perpetuated by your soaps, your OC's etc. But it does seem like it's one extreme or another. Hot guy, average wife/girlfriend/host or vice versa. Let's have a little equal opportunity averageness/hotness. The perfect example that I can think of right now that's still on the air is Malcolm in the Middle. Okay the family's a bunch of nutters, but you're not going to find Jane Kaczmaerek working the runway (she's far too elegant for that) and the show's a big hit. 'Roseanne's another show where the stars were far from supermodel material and yet the country embraced it with open arms.  I'm rambling now and don't really know where I'm going with this so I shall stop that thread :) The only other thing that sort of had me dumbfounded last night was watching an ad for Denis Leary's new firemen show on F/X and in one of the clips from the show, a character says the word 'shitload.' I nearly fell out of my chair. 'Shit' is a BIG no-no word according to our censors so I was gobsmacked to hear it would be part of that show, *and* used in the advertising for it. Granted, F/X isn't one of the Big Three networks; it's a cable network, but one that comes with every basic cable package and therefore more accessible than say, HBO. So I'm wondering if censoring for those channels has relaxed at all or what's going on. I'm confused :) It's the same with another cable network, TBS which is showing Sex and the City now complete with a little nudity and the use of the word 'asshole'. Normally 'asshole' has 'hole' bleeped out.  I did find it amusing that F/X was showing a heavily edited version of 'Die Hard' where the 'God' in 'Goddamn' was bleeped out, yet let 'shitload' be uttered during a commercial :)",male,27,Technology,Capricorn,0

Tell one thing that happened to you in that year (if you grab a coin with a year before you were born find another one :) ).    Ok..its a Swiss 20 rappen piece from 1980.  Ah in 1980, my father bought our first home computer, and my life definitely took a slant in the geeky direction ;)    What comes to mind first when you hear the word ""reality""? Why?   I guess I think of the concept of a real life, one outside with others and with a real significant other.no computers or geeky engineering stuff that I spend my day doing.   What is the most honest thing you have done?   Call to the police to admit that I had made a prank phone call that had gone to far. I had to go to court because of it for ""false reporting to authorities,"" but got let off.   What do you like to do most with a free hour? Why?   Hmm..usually its try and organize my place or at least make a bit of progress with it.  If I am not at home though, I guess its just to catch up on a bit of reading    If you could smash one thing and one thing only, what would you smash? Why?   Hmm..the speed bump I have to go over with my bike on my way to work and back.   For what do you think you would be willing to lay down your life? Why?   Probably for a group of people that I cared about. I guess movies like Titanic try to make it look noble to sacrifice your life that way.   What one word would you put on your gravestone? Why?   Thanks.  Hey, it was one interesting experience ;)   What TV advertisement bothers you the most? Why?   Any of those pay per minute chat line ads that get repeated over and over during late night tv.   What was your first job?   Ok..outside of various yardwork type jobs, it would have been fabricating ceramic superconductors in a laboratory.   Finish the sentence: âI have neverâ¦â  done an illegal drug   Ok..through that list of questions.  So what else is new besides having laid bare several aspects of my life, I finally worked up the courage to phone a woman up for a lunch date.  Although she told me she usually did not go to lunch, she agreed to make an exception in my case..so I was relieved there...still gotta set the date though.  Everyone seems to be going on vacation at work except me.  Looks like I may get stuck trying to figure out what to do with an intern whose boss will be gone for a month.

459891,3751152,2004-07-06,"I've been at a conference for the past two days and I wasn't really looking all that forward to it. It was in Loughborough which is a nice enough town in the East Midlands - about an hour and a half by train from London. So it was an early start on Tuesday having to leave the house at 7am, not nice especially since I'm never normally out of bed til 8.30! The conference was about Computer Aided Assessment - so getting students to do self-assessment and exams using a selection of online tests using objective question types (like multiple choice). Anyways, the conference papers were ok - some were great, others not so. The best bit for me was the evening's entertainment - a casino!  We were all given 4000 (fake - boo!) pounds to play with - apart from those of us who managed to convince the guy giving out the money that there really WERE two additional people sitting at our table ;) So I had 6000 pounds worth of fake money (boo!) in my pocket and headed to the poker table first, exchanging only 2000 to begin with. Started off ok, won a few hands - didn't win all that much but managed to get up to about 3500. Moved onto another table where they had wheel of fortune and managed to win another couple of thousand on that. So feeling lucky I moved over to the roulette table.   I bet cautiously at first, betting on odd, black and the occasional number or group of numbers, and I started winning. I'd managed to get up to about 18,000 (ooh and a bottle of champagne for having number 22 come up!) when I felt a bit tired and decided to try and lose all my money before retiring to bed. So I placed a few chips worth 5000 on various numbers round the board. Monster had texted me earlier and said to remember lucky black 3 - so out of loyalty I placed one on number 3 - it hadn't won me anything earlier in the evening, but what the heck I wasn't after winning. So the ball goes round and round and drops....into number 3! 175,000 (fake) pounds was mine! Highest win of the night....bugger, now I had to get rid of all that lot ;) Eventually managed to lose it all - it's amazing how quickly you can go from winner to loser, and toddled off to bed.

Tell one thing that happened to you in that year (if you grab a coin with a year before you were born find another one :) ).   1993...Hmm, 13 years old. What did I do..Hmm. OH, here's a good one.  Ever year, schools from around BC have a kind of math championship. It's a source of great pride in a school to have people their. It's essentially like a jeopardy competition. But first, everyone has to write a test that will rank them 1-10 for the final competition. We do the test, a room full of kids ages 12-14, and I finish first...Mostly because I hate taking tests with a passion and want to get them over as soon as possible. After I finish the test, I sit around and wait for the guy sitting next to me to finish (as he's got a gameboy and the game he was playing looked neat..C'mon, I was a kid :)) He finishes, and we're sitting there playing gameboy and waiting for the rest of the people to finish the test.   Eventually, everyone finishes and we're told to go have lunch or some such nonsense while the tests are marked and we're given our rankings for the competition. We all troddle back inside and sit down and we're given our competitors for the final round. It turns out I was first seed (Yippy skippy) and will be playing against some chick who looks 2 years older then I do. We are seated in our chairs, with Jeopardy buzzers sitting in front of us linked to an alarm system with a light (So you know for sure who hit first). The puzzle goes up on the screen in front of you, and you've given 3 minutes, a pad of paper and a pencil to figure out the problem. I may not like tests, but I love competition so I get right down to it. I scribble out a couple calculations, slap my head with the OBVIOUSNESS of the problem, and with a big smile, put my hand up...while the girl next to me takes an extra second and hits the buzzer.  FUCK ME!  At any rate, I got kicked out first round, and the rest of the questions were pretty easy...*sigh*   What comes to mind first when you hear the word ""reality""? Why?   Virtual. Completely and utter tripe. The closest thing we have to accessible virtual reality are those games you play in arcades. Y'know, with light guns or the big headsets that go over your head and you stand in the middle shooting at people. I like games like that (especially the boxing one, an excellent work out). I'm also very appreciative of those lightgun games that require you to duck and dodge and move. It's funny, video games would be an excellent way to make kids get off their lazy fat asses and do something (Look at the asians and Dyason with their Dance Dance Revolution!)   What is the most honest thing you have done?  Told someone I didn't love them and we should just be friends. I burst out laughing afterwards at just the clicheness of it. From then on, I vowed to break up with women the old fashioned way. Be a complete and utter misogynist pig, slap them around, drink a lot and sleep around! WOot!   What do you like to do most with a free hour? Why?  Read, browse, snuggle. The first two I can do on the internet, the second requires Christine. I like snuggling :(   If you could smash one thing and one thing only, what would you smash? Why?  TELUS management. I don't think they realize how many awesome people they have working for them, and the fact that they spend so much money doing stupid things like nightclubs instead of giving these people RAISES to keep them working hard just makes me want to start my own company up that treats all of its employees like gold, and kicks the ass of the big companies who haven't a clue how to remain a good company to work for.   For what do you think you would be willing to lay down your life? Why?  In the event of a world war, I'd be the first in line to sign up as a volunteer for my country. There's just something so valiant about feeling so strongly for a cause that you'd be willing to die to protect it. My grandparents all served in WW2, but none of my uncles or aunts did anything relating to Vietnam or Korea. I think it's my duty to have served in some way, shape or form.   What one word would you put on your gravestone? Why?  'OOPS', because I'll probably die in some hideously hilarious fashion that people for years will look back and shake their head at. Like, say, sneezing really hard and hitting my head on my desk, knocking myself unconcious and swallowing my tongue.   What TV advertisement bothers you the most? Why?  TV, whassat?   What was your first job?   I delivered papers for about a week before I learned I have no respect for old people, nor am I very sure-footed on icy surfaces. I was delivering papers across the valley here in Fruitvale and I was a little too rambunctious.. I jumped down onto someones walkway, slipped and did a nice flying faceplant onto the ground.

459893,3751152,2004-07-06,"Well I seem to be into answering all kinds of weird questions the last few days so I don't know why this should be an exception.  Here it goes:   Grab the nearest coin and look at the date. Tell one thing that happened to you in that year (if you grab a coin with a year before you were born find another one :) ).  Luckily, Adam is good at leaving coins all over the house.  Out of the pile on the desk I have a quarter that looks like its got blue ink on it - its from 1976.  The only thing that happened to me in that year was that I was born :)   What comes to mind first when you hear the word ""reality""? Why?  Bites?  Wasn't that a movie?   What is the most honest thing you have done?  I think the one of the hardest honest things to do is when you have a bit of information that you know could REALLY hurt someone and you still tell them.  Not because you want to hurt them, but because they're your friend and, as far as I'm concerned, thats what friends are supposed to do.   What do you like to do most with a free hour? Why?  Back in the day it would have been something like walking on Kits beach, scrapbooking, or something of the like.  Now if I have a free hour I just want to be with Adam.   If you could smash one thing and one thing only, what would you smash? Why?  The Bush Administration - starting with George Dubya himself.  HULK SMASH!!!   For what do you think you would be willing to lay down your life? Why?  I don't think there is any 'cause' that would make me want to do that - I'm pretty much opposed to war and that sort, but I would most likely do that for family - mine and Adam's.   What one word would you put on your gravestone? Why?  Um, I think I'll be dead and I won't really care what is on it.  Although, it might be funny if it had something pertaining to evil stuff or world domination.     What TV advertisement bothers you the most? Why?  I don't have cable so I wouldn't know :)   What was your first job?  Being that my dad was in the military, my mom always worked up at the mess halls doing military functions and weddings and such.  So I basically got a job as a waitress doing all this stuff.  It was actually quite fun sometimes as it was a pretty big military base and we'd always get these young Americans or some of our own militia.  Being a young girl, well, it was nice to drool over these guys or have them talk to you ;)   Finish the sentence: âI have neverâ¦â  ...tried karate but will later tonight :)  Whee!",male,27,Technology,Capricorn,0
459894,3751152,2004-07-06,"So I kind of like answering these silly quiz questions. I don't know why. Maybe a strong desire to give total strangers a little insight into my inner being? I dunno. Anyway, I did a short list of ten questions from some sort of fun icebreaker things we do at meetings every now and then. Handy for those times when you don't really have anything to blog about :) You lot can answer them, or not, it doesn't matter. It's all in fun :)   Grab the nearest coin and look at the date. Tell one thing that happened to you in that year (if you grab a coin with a year before you were born find another one :) ).   Well I grabbed a quarter from 1998 which is easy for me :) Thatâs the year my daughter and I spent in Engerland. I worked for a Nazi who owned a pub/B&B in Little Hampden called The Rising Sun and we lived above the pub with the rest of the staff. Mondays in London were great :)   What comes to mind first when you hear the word ""reality""? Why?   I end up thinking of reality tv because I watch a couple of them. Survivor when itâs on, and right now Iâm kind of hooked on Blow Out on Bravo.   What is the most honest thing you have done?    I have done the âreturn the wallet with all the money still intactâ thing.   What do you like to do most with a free hour? Why?   Depends on where I am. If Iâm at work or something, Iâd probably blog somewhere. If Iâm waiting for an appointment, Iâve got a book. If Iâm at home, Iâd probably read there as well. Or play Spider solitaire on the comp.   If you could smash one thing and one thing only, what would you smash? Why?   Easy. My fecking computer.   For what do you think you would be willing to lay down your life? Why?   For a cause or something? I donât know if I believe in anything that strongly. Iâd be more apt to lay down my life for my family.   What one word would you put on your gravestone? Why?   Mine would say âByeeeâ or maybe âWTF?â or something silly.   What TV advertisement bothers you the most? Why?   Carrottop should be shot on site and never allowed to make another ad for 1800-CALL-ATT.   What was your first job?   I was an ice cream girl at one of those old-fashioned soda fountains on Cannery Row, in Monterey :) I could make 3 or 4 shakes, whip out a Fudgebana Split and throw an orgy together at the same time.

I feel like our's is still going because it's Tuesday and Paul is still at home:) I LOVE having my husband here at home:) I'm not ready for him to go back tomorrow. I've been spoiled.   Our weekend started out on Friday:) The kids and I picked Paul up from work early. It is impossible to go anywhere fast in the summer. It took us an hour and a half to get into Chicago. It usually takes, at the most, 45 minutes. Anywhoo, so we picked Paul up from work at 4pm and went to the Taste of Chicago:) It's Chicago's biggest festival. It runs from the Friday week before July 4th and ends at 9pm on the 4th. This year something like 4 million ppl showed up. Local restaurants set up their booths up and down Columbus Drive and around Grant Park. There are different stages for different performers and every night there is a big name that performs at the Petrillo Music Shell:)   WELLLLL, I was so excited because PAT BENETAR was performing Friday night:) So we got there and walked around for a bit. The kids got grapes and we got ice cream that was realllly soooo good:) After walking around the Taste for a little bit, we headed across to the lakefront and walked up and down there looking at the yachts and other assorted boats. Chicago is so pretty. The lakefront is amazing. If I didn't get so seasick from being on a boat, I'd have me a yacht and park myself out there all summer long. But, alas, I get sick just watching the boats bobble.*sigh*. The weather was gorgeous as well. It was the lower 70's and the wind almost made it a bit chilly:) We were leaving to come home and heard Pat Benetar come to the stage so we tottled on over to the Grant Park to watch and listen:) It was such a cool time:)   We got home about 9pm. Saturday we all went grocery shopping.. probably a huge mistake. It was the day before the 4th and everybody and their brother was at the grocery store. Sunday was the fourth and we went to the fair at Highland's Central Park. We do this every year. The kids love it and they did have such a good time:) Yesterday we didn't do much of anything. Paul went mountain biking and last night we had date night:)   Apparently, Paul has never just gone for a drive. Going no where in particular. Just driving. So that's what we did yesterday. We started out toward St John and then went past there to Cedar Lake then across to Lowell and then up to Merrillville:) We stopped at the Outback in Merrillville and had supper then came home. I think that was one of the nicest dates we've had:) I havent been riding in quite a while and I think he enjoyed it himself:)   Today I've been doing stuff for the garage sale. Paul has been working from home. They launched the Women of Home Depot *big eye roll* today and he's on call to make sure there aren't any serious glitches.   So there is our weekend. It's been a long one, but I'm not ready for it to end just yet. I have been spoiled I guess:).  Hope everyone else had a nice one as well:)  take care",male,27,Technology,Capricorn,0
459896,3751152,2004-07-05,"Ah..so my last post did make it.  I thought it was down when I tried and that I had wasted a good 10 minutes or so of my time.  Last time I mentioned my new iPod..now I am feeling quite guilty about it these days.  I accidently let slip that I had bought the iPod during my trip back from France for the 4th of July with a ladyfriend.  What followed was one of my greatest guilt trips of the year as she went off on me about how there was no good reason for me to buy it and how I didn't listen to anything she told me about how to better manage myself.  It was a lousy end to a great trip that included a private showing of the King Tut artifacts, a very spicy Thai dinner, early morning jogging in France, visits to 3 interesting French towns, and pizzas topped with apples and plums.  Anyways, I managed to mend things with the woman by telling her I would consult her the next time before I made such a purchase and by leaving some gummi bears on her desk at work during her lunch break.  I now realize that I do have some sort of buying addiction of technology-related items.  Those of you who have met me know how many gadgets I have and how I love to always have them about me.  The problem is I have too many of them and am always struggling to keep up with the newest ones out there.  So I gotta figure out some sort of course of action to deal with this problem.  Another interesting problem I have noticed about myself is not being able to come home before 10 pm after work.  I am now doing a break from language classes, but I still for whatever reason can not manage to get home..tonight after a bit of spodding at work, I went to the local pool hall and played a couple of games till 10pm came around..for some reason I just don't like going home......",male,27,Technology,Capricorn,0

My grandmother is still hanging in there, she'll be 97 next week.  Her pneumonia symptoms are slowly clearing up.  No more cough, but still has laboured breathing.    Since last Wednesday, I've been living on my own, and that will end today when Scott and Sue return from their vacation to Fruitvale and Kelowna.  I've been feeding their cat Kittles for them while they've been gone.  She is the strangest cat I've ever seen.  She's so anti-social, she makes hermits look outgoing and friendly.  Since they left, she's become a recluse, hiding here and there, only coming out to eat and look for Scott.  But in that time, I saw Spiderman 2, possibly one of the best movies I've ever seen.  Totally enjoyed it!  I really enjoyed the performance of Rosemary Harris and Alfred Molina.  They really made the movie for me.  Their characters were very well performed.  James Franco did a good job, NOT!  He played the easiest role of all.  The spoiled rich kid who wants revenge cause someone has wronged him.  Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst did well in their roles, but they didn't change all that much from the first movie, which I loved as well.  Friday night was a night in enjoying the Busch Series race, while Saturday night was the same, except I enjoyed most of a quart of rum and the NASCAR race from Daytona.  Sunday was a day of nothingness.  Lots of sleep, a really good supper and lots of Simpsons.  Yesterday was back to work.  A good day of photoshop-ing some pictures for the library screensaver!  THANKS STEPH!!!  I got lots done and enjoyed a nice quiet shift on the media desk.  As for my ebay winnings, last Friday, the boxed sets of Robotech started to arrive.  Sadly, set #5 arrived on Friday, and as you can guess where this is going, Boxed set #4 arrived last night.  So last night, I cleaned up the little mess I had made in the house, had a nice supper of fish and green beans and while watching some of the Robotech Masters series.  Dana Sterling, Marie Crystal, Bowie, Angelo Dante...just like I remembered them.  WWE RAW was on, then I played around for a bit on my PC, read some more of the new book I started, The Lone Drow and hit the sack.  Now for my rant!  My Mom called last night to say my phone bill from Aliant had arrived.  I was like cool, 5.75 for my email account right?  Nope, 300 and something in miscellaneous charges.  w00t!!! Those rotten dumbasses.  And to make matters worse, if you need help, Aliant's business hours for help are 8am to 6pm.  So if your phone is fucked any time after 6pm, you're screwed without service until the next day.  Isn't that great.  So I called internet support to see if they could tell me if I was billed for the adsl modem I had returned in April.  They couldn't tell me anything.  Just as I figured they couldn't.  So I get to work and call this morning.  37 minutes and 16 seconds of being on hold and I get the billing department.  I explain my problem and ask to know what I was billed for.  The woman's response, oh.  I can't see that information.  That comes from the credit department.  HELLO!  You billed me for this stuff and you can't tell me wtf  you billed me for?  HELLO!  Wake up!  I want service, not to be more pissed off.  So she puts in my complaint to the billing department.  So anyway, I ask how long will that take.  Your complaint will be held up due to the strike.  How long will it take?  Oh, anywhere from a month to two months to resolve this.  Ok.  Well, I'm not paying you anything.  No, you shouldn't.  We've billed so many customers for stuff that is wrong, it's sad right now.  Ok.  Well, cancel every service I have with you, which should only be an email account.  You can tell me I have an email account right?  You are billing me for it.  Yes, sir, you do have an email account and nothing else with us.  Ok.  Cancel it.  What's your email address sir, I can't see what the account name is!  It's drizzt@nbnet.nb.ca.  Oh yes, I see that right here.  This is pathetic.  I'm wavering on sending a complaint to the CRTC about this.  This is the worst service I've received from anyone.  Anyway, I have the slip to prove I returned the modem and they won't give me a number for the department I want to talk to so I can resolve this.  It better be dealt with ASAP, because I hate this crap and like to get it resolved right away.  Telephone companies, they should all be shut down we should all become telepathic.

I therefore would like to dedicate this post to Matt! Yup, finally I no longer have to risk Ginge's bed to spod ;)  I am now settling into life in Dorset quite nicely. It took me only 3 weeks to get a job (and I wasn't really trying that hard the first week, as you do). So yey! I start on Monday so am making the most of my last week of freedom...well not really, I'm sat here at the computer as normal but never mind!  I have to do a three day induction course next week which is sounding worryingly like those dodgy 'managerial courses' they send people on to 'bond' and so forth. I need to take with me three items...which is a bit of a bugger as I didn't bring every bit of crap down south with me! 1. A photo of family or friends (lets see which dodgy meet photo should i pick?) 2. a momento of my best ever holiday (i don't have momentoes other than sand in my suitcase) and 3. an object that helps describe your favourite interest outside of work (sex, drink, err?). So I need to get thinking...  Oh and what the hell are penguin videos doing on our blog? Has Russ infiltrated blogger to add his personal collection?",male,27,Technology,Capricorn,0
459901,3751152,2004-07-05,"So I've been slacking in the TCZ posts, I know.  I've blogged elsewhere (*cackle*) but have been too lazy to get this far.  Not to mention that I've actually had to work quite a bit in the last week so I've generally been busy and extremely tired.  Not really much is new in our world.  Adam is combatting the evil pollen that snows around here (STILL) and we've actually spent more time with his family this past weekend then we have in a while (including his grandmother!).  It was actually nice - and I drank lots of red wine so thats reason to be happy on its own.  We got to see Rob/Snarf on Friday which was nice - hopefully he wasn't too wired after having some  Tarte au Sucre  ;)  For a recipe see KathrynAnn's website.  Tonight we are most likely going to see Sue/Sydney & Scott/Weagle as they are also in town.  Last time they were here we played this great boardgame (Cranium) so we'll probably end up doing the same ;)  Nothing major planned for this week - maybe I'll get my butt back into gear and finish up my scrapbooks which have been sitting idling by since I lived in Toronto.  Perhaps I will also do more yardwork - I don't know.  Depends on how many shifts I get this week (so far, only one).  As for how I'm feeling myself - physically, much better.  The pills they gave me seem to have the done trick and I no longer have any sort of abdominal pain.  Hopefully it stays that way and everything returns to normal.  Emotionally, I'm a little bit up and down.  I was pretty down by the end of this weekend due to feeling exhausted from work, etc so that rather sucked.  Hopefully things will improve.  Right now I just feel like I need a vacation somehow (no dear, not an Alaskan cruise - thats next year ;)).  But then again, in the past when I have felt kind of crappy I always took some sort of vacation - whether that was to my dad's in Ottawa or somewhere in Europe or flying transcontinentally - it just sort of happened.  On the brighter side of things - I'm down 3lbs.  Yeah okay not THAT much but its a start and I'm happy with that.  I'm looking to be down 20-30 lbs by CAN3 in Oct so I'm totally getting my butt in gear.  I love having an elliptical trainer at home :)    Anyhoo, must be off...",male,27,Technology,Capricorn,0
459902,3751152,2004-07-04,"Damnit all to hell and back.  As I mentioned in a previous blog, I'd never seen Sex AND the City (thank you Corey for setting me straight on the title). I haven't had HBO in yonks so I never was able to watch it. And I'm not really one to rent DVDs of television shows - well, until out of boredom one day I rented 24 and well, most of you know how that turned out. So when Sex and the City premiered on TBS I decided to see what all the hype was about.  I liked it, laughed with it, but on the whole I found myself troubled by how I couldn't relate to much of it at all. I couldn't find a single thread to attach myself to that would suck me into it. No pun intended. I was regarding it as a light, fluffy fun little show but I wouldn't be devastated if I missed catching it when it aired.  So now it's the 4th of July weekend and my daughter's birthday is over, it's too feckin' hot and humid outside to go do anything and frankly, I live in one of the dullest places on earth anyway so I decide to spend the day seeing the real Sex and the City, The episodes with the swearing and the nudity and all the good stuff they just can't show on network television.  I definitely like the dirty version much better :)  Not that the show is like watching porn or anything. It just seemed a little deeper (again, no pun intended) and less fluffy with all the juicy bits back in. But in my haste to get out of the hectic crowds in the only Blockbuster in town, I grabbed the wrong season. I blame shitty labelling actually. Anyway, I ended up renting the sixth and final season. Or what I thought was the whole season anyway. Luckily SatC seems to be one of those shows where it's ok to jump in anywhere. So I watched episodes 1-12 and I found that there were many threads I could grab onto and enjoy the show - but my favourite thread was seeing Misha again. I had forgotten that Baryshnikov was a part of the final season; I had read about it a while ago and I remember thinking, 'Oh my god Baryshnikov!'  I love that man. I saw him in White Knights when I was a little older than my daughter and ohhh, he just killed me in that. The accent, the body, the glow-in-the-dark-eyes, the beautiful dancing.... *girly sigh* I know White Knights was no Oscar-worthy movie but it will always be on my Top 10 list of favourite films just for the interaction between Misha and the legend Gregory Hines (R.I.P.).  I won't gush anymore about Misha, who despite Corey's determined declarations that he is not aging well, looked just as beautiful to me now as he did back then when he showed up in episode 12. Man oh man. So when I finished that disc I was all fired up to rent the final episodes and see more of him. Yes I know how the show ends and stuff but I wanted to look at him some more :)  Unfortunately the fecking final episodes haven't been released on DVD yet. I'm so crushed. And I can't for the life of me find out anywhere online when they will be released which is even more disappointing.  This post is in danger of reaching Fire lengths if I carry on about it, but I've decided maybe I should actually start watching the show from the beginning and kill time before they release Misha for me. So if you'll excuse me, I saw a cute pair of Manolo's and they are calling my name.",male,27,Technology,Capricorn,0

I got to see my family, a couple of my friends (including Fire and Trinity!) and even get in a little sun. I left tuesday afternoon for Trail and was planning on staying two weeks. However, those plans got muddled up when I received an employment opportunity (which starts tomorrow) last thursday. This guy wants to to help him fix up his 7 bedroom house - he says it should be for the rest of the summer. The guy is selling the house in september so he wants a good worker to do some grunt work for him. He chose the right guy!  Today I've gone shopping and am getting things ready for my job tomorrow.

459905,3751152,2004-07-02,"Heidi ho, neighborinos.  I've been reading someone elses blog (Completely and utterly unrelated to TCZ) for awhile now. I had accidently stumbled across it while hard at work and I found the circumstances he was undertaking quite interesting, if only from a ""God I would NEVER do that"" perspective. The quick summary is: He met this girl online through LiveJournal (He lives in Las Vegas, she lived in Wisconsin), they fell in love over the phone, and now she was going to move in with him and they were going to live happily ever after. Well, my Adam-sense went off and I lurked both his and her journals for about two months (The whole courtship -> moving thing took about a month and a half) and oddly enough, they both stopped posting for about 3 weeks after ""THE BIG MOVE"".  One day, I'm reading the  DearAsshole Livejournal community   and there's a post from her being completely and utterly BITCHY. Now I have to say, I didn't much like her from the beginning. Her profile was a big ball of bullshit wrapped in horsepucky. She had an IQ of 172, she was an attorney at 17, she was lead editor of major newspapers at 16, blah blah blah; altogether, she was the queen bee on a honeypot of vinegar (Oooh, mixed metaphor).    Her post, in this big journal (Which she KNEW he read) is as follows:    Okay, let's talk about consideration......  Dear Asshole:  I moved across the country to be with you. You said you loved me. You said a lot of things.  I understand you don't have tons of relationship experience. I understand you've never lived with a girl before. And that is okay. I understand that means you'll have to learn some things about being in a relationship. And that is okay, too.  Let's talk about what isn't okay.  I don't care how little relationship experience you have, there are certain things that are about common courtesy and human decency.  Let's say your girlfriend comes home after a 12 hour long shift at her brand-new, stressful job. And this girlfriend needs to wind down, so she goes to watch a baseball game on TV - quietly, because she knows you're napping in the next room. And let's say half an hour later you wake up. And you go out to the living room and you see her sleeping, dozed off in front of the game. What do you do, what do you do?  Here's what a reasonable human being would do: a reasonable human being would either put a blanket on her and turn off the tv, or possibly wake her up so she could go to the bed and be more comfortable.  But here's what YOU did instead, by way of contrast. You came to the living room, turned the TV to a different channel, and raised the volume, waking said girlfriend up - in spite of the fact that there was a TV in the bedroom you could've watched if you needed to see The Simpsons that badly.  But the girlfriend was understanding and just went to the bedroom to sleep some more.  What would a reasonable human being do at this point? It's pretty easy - they'd be quiet while she napped, or keep things at a generally reasonable noise level.  What did you do? You decided to do dishes. To run the garbage disposal. And to play music loudly enough that you could hear it over the garbage disposal.  No reasonable man would expect to be able to do this and still have his testicles attached at the end of the day.  But your girlfriend was so nice that she didn't even mind this so much - maybe, she thought, the music wasn't as loud as she perceived it. So she put in earplugs to block it out and finally sleep.  She realized when she did, that not only could she hear every lyric of the song playing, she could feel the bass line in the floor.  This made her upset, incredibly upset actually. She'd had a hard day at work and was exhausted, and now she couldn't sleep - and what the hell kind of person would do that, anyway?   The more she thought about it, the madder she got. And while she usually is the first to say when something is wrong, she decided she shouldn't have to tell ANYONE not to blast loud music while someone is napping in the next room, regardless of their lack of relationship experience.  So when she finally does tell you, is it your fault for being an asshole, or is it her fault for failing to ask you nicely to turn down the 80 dB music you felt was fine to play while someone was napping?  Reasonable person survey says: the first one.  You said the second. You said you didn't know the music was that loud. When I insisted you must have, you said you didn't think I could hear it through the bedroom door - in spite of the fact that you've turned down the living room TV as you were going to bed before so it wouldn't bother you. Then you used the usual ""I'm new at this and if I make mistakes it's just because I've never been told."" Never been told? THREE YEAR OLDS know not to disturb people with noise as they sleep. Then you resorted to calling me a hypocrite because I ask you to bring me relationship troubles when they happen - you know what? Doing that isn't a relationship problem. It's a problem with being a human being and existing in society. No one does that shit.  So when we fought, I ended up saying you were totally inconsiderate, to which you replied ""but I'm not TRYING to be,"" as if that made it okay. Let me tell you something: no one tries to be inconsiderate. You have to try to be considerate. Well, ok, so I told you, and you agreed to be more considerate.  We also agreed I wouldn't go up this weekend to meet your family, but you'd still go on the trip - leaving me alone at the apartment over the long weekend (some alone time I desperately needed). And you asked me if I'd get the oil changed in your car today so you wouldn't have to skip lunch and do that instead on your lunch break. Fine, I don't mind doing you a favor, even after all that crap. I got the oil change, which came to $32. You gave me $40.  When you got home, you asked me for the keys and your change. Because of money things, that change was the only money I had to spend all weekend. And now it was gone, and you didn't even think about it. And you didn't even thank me for getting it done for you.  And then you left. I went to grab a soda from the fridge - and then realized you'd taken all of it and there was nothing left to drink in the entire house.  Fine, I decided to brew some iced tea - I'd just filled the ice cube trays the night before, so I brewed the tea, poured it into the pitcher, and then looked in the freezer - you had emptied the ice cube trays and put them back in the freezer absolutely empty. I was holding cold, hollow plastic with not a single cube of ice.  These are not the actions of a person who's just inexperienced at relationships. They are the actions of someone absolutely inexperienced with life. You are the most socially retarded person I have ever had the misfortune to meet. I have known autistic kids who know that loud noise wakes people up. I have known developmentally disabled children who know better than to leave empty ice cube trays in the freezer.  What's your excuse, asshole? Sincerely,  me   So, the guy is a big dweeb. Some of her complaints are relatively legitamite, some are just what you naturally go through in the first couple months of a relationship, some are just weird. She's venting, so let her vent. Anyways, not a day later, comes his response....awesome :)    His post:    Dear me:  So you want to talk about âreasonablenessâ and âconsideration.â  Well I donât know whether I should start from the beginning, or from now and work my way back. Either way there is no conceivable way in which I could possibly cover all of the examples of how youâve done oh so well at exhibiting the highest standards of both. [/sarcasm]  Since my mind has a tendency to go all over the place, I suppose Iâll just let it out as it comes out. I suppose the 12 hour work day would be a start. Actually, I suppose we could go into what a rough week of work you hadâ¦..wait a second, a week?!?!? I would LOVE it if I could have gotten away with working less than two weeks in the previous two months. But no, thatâs not an option Iâve had. You see, while you were busy sitting at home talking to your friends and playing on the Internet all day, I was busy working EVERY day because quite frankly if I didnât, Iâd be writing this from a cardboard box right about now.  You moved out here by giving me the understanding that youâd save up enough money to support yourself for a couple of weeks while you got settled in.   And I realize we got off to a rough start. After your mother went to the trouble of warning me about the shittiness of your car I asked you if you were sure that it would be okay to make it across the country (especially through the Colorado Rockies in snow season). You assured me that it would be fine and not to worry. I trusted you, obviously that was my first mistake. Because obviously a âreasonableâ person would believe that a 10-year old Cadillac with nearly 200,000 miles on it and a host of problems can be trusted to make it 2,000ish miles in 2 days.  After said car died on us in Denver I rented a car with the assurance that your parentâs oh so wonderful AAA Gold membership would take care of it. Well, what choice did I have? We needed to get home right? So even as I dreaded that, and the fact that it meant weâd have to drive back the next weekend, and drive 24 hours in two days, I really didnât have a problem with it. I loved you and I was willing to do whatever I had to in order to make things work.  Later when we realized that we wouldnât have the money to pay for the repairs (after Iâd already obtained a pay day loan to cover the charges for the rental car that I thought Iâd be recovering at some point in time) I did something I havenât done in years. I asked my father for money. Due to his generosity, inspired by a desire to help us start out on the right track, he obliged. But much like other fiscal matters in the months to come you didnât show me the slightest bit of gratitude for what I had done. Even after I told you how hard it was for me to ask him for money you couldnât even acknowledge that and thank me for doing it, for you, for us.  I was relieved when you told me the repairs would be far less than we thought they would be. I didnât think the car was worth keeping for the greater amount. So you can imagine my shock (or at least a reasonable person would) when you paid the bill and it ended up being nearly twice what Iâd planned for. Oh well, what was done was done. Again, no thanks, no acknowledgement.  But enough about that damn car, even if after we went to all that trouble to bring it back here it died less than a week later. And even if as of YESTERDAY I was asking you to help me move it so that it wouldnât be towed you said âI donât want to do it now, weâll do it when you get back.â  Thatâs always your response, âIâll do it later.â That seems to have been your attitude for everything from making an appointment with a temp. service, to giving them the information they need when you finally do work. Last Saturday I had to get yet another pay day loan (both of these the first time Iâve done so in well after a year, and previously it was because of dealing with my dead car) because you couldnât be bothered to go to the temp service at a convenient time. When I came home sick from work on Thursday I asked you if you could take care of it that day, since obviously I wouldnât be needing my functioning car for anything for the rest of the day. âIâll take you to work tomorrow, and do it thenâ you said. This was BEFORE you knew that you had a phone interview at 2:00 that day. After that I was fine with it (although you couldâve still done both). But no, you couldnât even stop to consider for a second that doing it that day wouldâve been a helluva lot more considerate of the fact that doing without my car (especially unnecessarily) is a huge hassle to me. So anyway, as a result, it didnât get done in time and I was left borrowing money so I could silly little things like put drinks in the fridge.  Oh yes, the drinks in the fridge. I love your renewed attitude of guilty until proven innocent. So I guess Iâll jump ahead a bit and move on to yesterday. I gave you $40 for the oil change, because I figured that would cost about $20, and it might need a new air filter, so then $20 wouldnât cut it. According to the receipt in my car it came to just under $20. You gave me $8 and some change and told me youâd purchased a few other things. I hadnât planned for that, but oh well. I figured you wouldnât buy anything you didnât really need right?  Of course a conversation about this probably wouldâve been much easier to have if you hadnât been on the phone the whole time. Silly me. If I say I love someone and theyâre going away for three days I think I could get off the phone long enough to give a proper goodbye to that person and work out any necessary details.   Oh yeah, so speaking of that paycheck that you couldnât be bothered to take care of last week. Well you managed to receive that check this week. Over $200, well over the change I took back from you so that I could eat on my way up here. When I got in the car I noticed your wallet with your ID was in there. I knew you couldnât cash your check without that or a car, so I made a trip upstairs to make sure you had both (your ID, my brotherâs car). Youâd asked me the day before where the check cashing place was, so I had stupidly assumed that since you had the means to cash your check, you would so. This seemed especially reasonable as you had given me NO indication that you needed any other money. Had you said ANYTHING I wouldâve had no problem taking out more than $40 and having you keep what you needed to get by. Iâm still baffled as to why you claim to be broke this weekend based somehow, on my actions.  As for the drinks issue. Wow, hereâs where your lovely tendency to assume the worst in me really comes to shine. When I went to hit the road I saw there were two sodas left. I grabbed one figuring youâd have the last one and that would tide you over until you could get off your ass long enough to get money and to the store. Obviously I was wrong, but this is proving not to be a first for me. It wasnât until Iâd gotten on the road that I saw John drinking one that I figured out heâd grabbed the last one. By then it was too late, but I figured youâd manage. Afterall, would it really be THAT wrong of me if I had intentionally the last in a pack of soda that Iâd paid for?!?!?  So you went to get some ice, and apparently it wasnât there. Again you assume it was somehow my nefarious motives that precluded those ice trays from having ice in them. Sorry, thatâs not the case. Upon some investigation John tells me that Robby used them on Sunday night and may have not refilled them. I havenât touched them in weeks, but thanks for assuming that if I did I wouldnât refill them. Before you came along if it werenât for me they never would have been filled.  But the dishes, oh yes, my washing of the dishes, the most egregious sin of all. But geez, did anyone reading this stop and ask WHY a guy with no relationship or living with a partner experience would have cause to do dishes? Anyone who knew me or my lifestyle would know that doing dishes used to be rare event for me. Why? Because I live like a bachelor. I donât cook, I donât mess up my dishes, and when I do I rinse them off.   So the reason I was doing dishes is quite simple. I was cleaning up after you. The problem is to say that is a gross (and I do mean that literally) understatement is putting it incredibly lightly. I really fail to see how someone that leaves half consumed food on the stove (and thatâs assuming they turn the stove or oven off when theyâre done with it) and unrinsed dishes anywhere has ANY room to speak about lack of consideration. The fact that Robby got so frustrated with it after your first week here that he cleaned it himself and that you still didnât figure out that it was a problem boggles my mind.  So why did I have to do it that night of all nights? Well up until then I thought we were going out of town together to enjoy a nice weekend together with the relaxation we both deserved. I looked forward to showing you around the place I grew up and sharing the things around here that hold significance to me. I wanted to share everything with you. But even after I thought weâd made up you didnât want to go because youâd ârather sleep.â  I canât help but be more than a little blown away by that after you complain about my sleep habits. And ahh yes, sleep. How dare I create noise while you try to sleep? Even after I told you repeatedly that your incessant clacking of the keys and the glare of the monitor prevents me from falling asleep you keep doing it. You told me to just tell you if it was bothering me and youâd come to bed. It would be just that easy! And yet every time I tried this it took you AT LEAST an hour to do so, and that was during the times you didnât yell at me for expecting someone that has to work EARLIER than I do to come to bed before 1:00 am. No, all you could do was stay up all night further validating my theory that youâd rather talk to or associate with anyone who is not me.  Iâm sorry, did I say you were on the computer to much? Sorry, you were on MY computer too much. Thatâs right, yours has been down the majority of your time here and even though it would only cost a few bucks to fix (per your claim) you make no effort to do so. And why should you? Youâre on mine if youâre a) awake b) not on the phone running up my long distance charges when you havenât paid for any of the other expenses youâre using since your first week here and c) not busy making a mess in the kitchen. And then Iâm made to feel guilty if I spend five minutes on it. Remember when Iâd been using it, was in the middle of the game and I got up to use the bathroom and you were on it for the next hour? Yeah, real fucking considerate.   But you know what? I could get past a lot of this stuff if I thought it was worth it. But I donât know if I can get over the passive-aggressive manner in which youâve chosen to address this. I mean really, a post in a LiveJournal community that you had to know full well that I was a member of? (If you didnât, all you had to do was check my user info page, and I highly doubt you were unaware).  Heaven forbid that you talk to me about this. Heaven forbid that you call me (my cell phone is rarely more than two feet away from me, but that would require you not being 	on the phone already I supposeâ¦.). You couldnât even be bothered to validate ANY of the horrible things youâd assumed about me. This continual pattern of assuming the worst of intentions in me has to stop if weâre going to have ANY hope of working this shit out.  Your inconsideration runs far too deep. As misguided and stupid as I may have been, my motives that ended up upsetting you that night were based in consideration (if I clean this stuff up tonight neither one of us will have to come home from a long drive to a smelly and gross kitchen). You on the other hand, are just innately inconsiderate. You may be incredibly intelligent for your age, but you have a LOT of growing up to do. And if you can't acknowldge any of your role in this, then I really don't know what you're still doing in my home.    And my jaw just hits the floor. Best Online Fight Ever.

459911,3751152,2004-08-15,"Ever since I moved to New Mexico to start the first grade, August has always marked a terrifying time of the year for me...namely going back to classes.  Even many years and a Ph.D. later, across the Atlantic, and to a different culture, I still find myself in that ever-terrifying first week at school.  Back at the age of 6 or 7 it was worries about if I would have to sit next to the class bully, could I get the paper book jackets on my text book straight, and would I spend all of my lunch money on football pencils.  Now, its more worries if I will understand the teacher in German or Italian, will I have to sit next to that obnoxious woman from the Czech republic, and who will I be paired with to complete the next assignment.  Thus today, I started 2 classes..well both were followups to previous classes - Tennis and German.  Tennis of course is really just a fun class - I should practice for homework, but usually do not.  I did notice 2 new women - but the darn instructor seperated all the men from the women..so I gotta figure out how to sneak onto the women's court next time ;)  Then it was off to my German class.  This one is an advanced class that is really like going to a high school English class -but in German - complete with reading novels and having to write essays discussing characters and their motives.  Only one other man in my German class - a Chinese- otherwise its dominated by Eastern European Women who delight in correcting me.  I forgot to bring my book with me, thus I had to share a book with one of them today.   Tomorrow the classes continue again with Italian..Oh boy..I hope I remember how to understand that language ;)",male,27,Technology,Capricorn,0
459912,3751152,2004-08-15,"People like to say that the truth is stranger than fiction.  Boy, if you know my family, you know they aren't kidding.  I shoot the... er... crap with my sister rather frequently, because we're both on MSN messanger.  So I see her... usually once a week or so.  And every time I catch up on the gossip, there's always something new to report.    My sister was the third child in our family.  So I wonder if it's just an extreme case of the Pay Attention To Meeeee's or just some sort of bizzare, unidentified personality disorder. :)  The former, you would have think would have worn off by now... she's in her early 20s.  The teenage angst should be over with.   Anyhow, this all began when my sister decided she wanted to be an adult entertainer.  Since she's... um... extremely overendowed, and she says she wasn't into any of the darker aspects of the trade, supposedly this consisted mostly of dressing up as a cheerleader and jumping up and down.  Pretty harmless stuff I guess, and it pays the bills for a while.  Not too bad, I suppose, but not something you expect to be doing for very long.  Well, it's true it didn't last for very long, because she's got an attention span for careers that lasts about 3 days.  :)  Sandra decided to go into business with a friend doing ""erotic"" massage as a masseusse by the name of Satin Touch.  Again, this was supposedly fairly innocent as far as the sex trades go, and went sour when Sandra's friend decided she wanted to add some female escort stuff on the side.  So she was out on her own again.  I think the whole family was expecting her to grow out of the phase and go back to real work.  But that would have been too normal for Sandra :)  Sandra decided she didn't like getting naked for people, so instead she moved sideways in the trade.  She decided to move into the realm of S&M.  Translation: she decided to try her hand at beating the crap out of men (and the occasional woman) for a living.  Now, granted, this sounds like every woman's dream job, especially when she's on the rebound :)  But rarely do people actually make the career choice ;)  She went all out, black leather and whips and stuff.  And she started joining the cast of the Rocky Horror Picture Show.  I'm having difficulty confirming what started first, her penchant for dressing as a man dressed as a woman in scary dominatrix outfits, or her work as a dominatrix.  I have a suspicion that the two are linked somehow :D    Speaking of which, here's a picture of her as Frank:  urlLink      urlLink http://denverrhps.com/ is also the site for the whole Denver RHPS scene.  Just for you, Steph :)  Near neighbors, geographically speaking.  Anyhoo, I thought this was about as bizzare as it could possibly get when Sandra recently announced another career change.  Sandra, possibly still suffering some post-traumatic teenage angst syndrome, had decided to run away and join the circus.  Well, I suppose it wasn't really running away, as they seem to be some sort of local group.  But yes, my dear sister has become, by her own volition, a carnival freak.  To be more precise, she decided to start a strong-man act where she lifts heavy objects with her boobs.  Like telephone books.  And somehow I had more difficulty convincing people that she had actually decided to do this than I did getting people to believe she was a dominatrix.  Go figure.  But now, ladies and gentleman, I have photographic evidence!  The naughty bits are not visible so I hope Steph doesn't get mad at me for this.  But really this was too priceless not to share.    I present to you: The Amazing Boobzilla!  urlLink     And yes, that really IS her carny name.  To boot, today I discover that she's decided to shack up with a fire-eater who goes by the unimaginitive name of ""Crispy.""  She says this whole group is his gig.  I guess he finds the idea of her lifting telephone books with her tits is really seductive or something.    Oddly enough, not too long ago (actually I think it was last week's news), for some reason my sister decided also to become an ordained minister.  I have no idea why.   But you know what?  Getting yourself married by the Amazing Boobzilla would definitely rate as an incredible thing.  I think it must actually edge out getting married by Elvis.  And you could hire on Crispy to spew some flaming vodka instead of doing that boring traditional crap like blowing bubbles or throwing rice.  I wonder if she performs the vow ceremony with telephone books under each tit.  That'd definitely present you with some unorthodox wedding photos. :D    Takers?

I guess, like Russ, he too was particularly taken with penguins, so much so that even a lion couldn't stem his demands. So, as I'm sure you've guessed, I was at London Zoo yesterday along with Star and Millymollymandy. As my pre-birthday treat, I was allowed to choose where we went for the day, so we all stumped up 13 quid (EEP!) to get in and wander round the zoo for 4-5 hours. As zoo's go it was ok, although I thought there would be a lot more animals there. The giraffes as always were impressive and I got to see plenty of monkeys including the little redheaded baby Francois langur that prompted ""Ginger Sunday"" last weekend - where over 1000 redheads got 2 for 1 entry to the zoo!  The meercats were cute and I still can't get over how small they are. Millymollymandy insisted on calling them all ""Phil"" after the TCZ character who did a meercat impression in one of the Bristol meet videos - and so when she called ""Phil"" at the meercat enclosure she was quite happy when one of them actually looked over. The penguins were cool (literally!) and unlike the child I now have a penguin (in the form of a money box and a new keyring to replace my rather delapidated lego-man keyring). I was very tempted to go up to the child when we saw him later and say ""I got a penguin! I got a penguin! I got a penguin! I got a penguin! I got a penguin! I got a penguin!""....but I couldn't be that evil, could I?  ;)  Next stop on the London sightseeing is a ""flight"" on the London Eye with Monster on Friday :)  I can't wait!!",male,27,Technology,Capricorn,0

459918,3751152,2004-08-12,"A special blog to fill a special request.  I'm going to be away from my home for a couple of days, taking a road trip to around Sanibel Island to track  urlLink Hurricane Charley . I'll answer all potential questions in a Q & A.   Q: Why are you going?   A: I'm part of the New York Times Regional Newspaper Group emergency team along the Gulf Coast. If there's a decent Hurricane or equivalent catastrophe, I'm there with fellow team members Diane (reporter) and Scott (photographer). I am the third wheel due to my knowledge of the network system.   Q: What's your job?   A: I'm there to make sure the wireless connections will be supported. I call around to hotels on the Island to see which have the capabilities of keeping our network afloat. Then I book three rooms (one for Diane, one for Scott and I and one for the computers, etc.) and find an electrician that can wire the place if it isn't wired. From there I'm strictly a watchdog. I keep charges in the laptops, communications with the editors at the desk, give them weather updates, check the network, check the net to track the storm and transmit the stories from our location to the group.   Q: What happens if something goes wrong?   A: The only three things that can go wrong are: flooding and pipes busting can take away my plan B (landlines); the hotel collapses (I'll die) and the power goes out (thus I lose my wireless capabilities and we're forced to run our laptops on battery and use the landlines. If the landlines are floodieed we'll have to send from a pay phone, which use old ,old lines that can even stand up in the most violent flooding.   Q: How bad is this Hurricane?   A: Looks like an ambitious Cat 2, which means the winds will hit around 90-100 MPH. That's pretty nice but nowhere near as bad as Hurricanes like  urlLink Gilbert  in 1989 and of course  urlLink Andrew  in 1992, Gilbert was a Cat 4 when it made American landfall and Andrew was a moderate Cat 5. This Hurricane isn't close to that.   Q: Are you scared?   A: Not really, I'm more excited than anything else. I'll be fine.   Q: When kind of supplies do you bring for this sort of trip?   A: Well I use the basic Hurricane emergency guidelines. I should be back tomorrow evening or Saturday morning but I'm still packing for four days in case the roads need a day to be cleared or something. I have about 12 gallons of water, lots of canned foods, first-aid kits, towels, etc. Nothing out of the ordinary for an emergency kit.   Q: If I see you tonight on TCZ what do I do?   A: Say hi. I'm stuck in a room chilled to the bone (for the computers) while Diane and Scott are probably in the hotel lobby drinking and whooping it up with the Weather Channel people. I have a high speed and hotel cable so chances are I'm bored to tears.   Q: Who watches your dogs?   A: I'm pysched I have a new housesitter since my old one got pregnant and married on me. Hopefully the house will be in one piece when I get back and it seems like my dogs love the sitter so that's the least of my worries. If that falls through, I'll take them with me.  I'll have more exciting details later. If I'm on and can give a blow by blow of the Hurricane as it hits, that'll be even better.  Peace!",male,27,Technology,Capricorn,0

Some conversation is going on about rides scratched at Alton Towers, but for this blog it is more important to reflect upon the events of the last 2 B10!  When I last left off, we were off to the beach.  Upon arriving, we broke up into a couple of groups.  Some headed straight for the sand, while another group of us decided to see some fish up close and personal at the aquarium.  We got to see shark feeding time from a submerged transparent walkway in a rather large tank full of sharks, stingrays, and giant turtles.  After boing up on our natural sciences, the others I was with decided to do bumper cars, but I decided to take the rare opportunity to allow this land-locked resident of Switzerland with no closeby beach to walk along the Bournemouth coast and take in the the local scenery and beach babes!!!  We then all met up and took the train back, linking up with another group of spods who had chosen to forsake the beach wonders for the safer realms of a local pub.  It was time then to prepare for the big night out at Jazz Juice!  We first went to a couple of watering spots in Bournemouth to soak up some liquor and then made our way back to near the beach and into the nightclub.  JazzJuice was basically a 70s retro night.  We danced or sat on the edge of the dancefloor until about 2.00 am.  Then we grabbed taxis and headed back to consume a midnight snack before hitting the sack.  We also got to observe why it was not a good idea for a taxi company to ever dissapoint our meet host ...  After the spods finally awoke on Sunday morning, we went to a local establishment for some traditional English breakfasts.  The Sunday afternoon event was either bingo or the water park, depending on one's tastes.  Your blogger personally chose the waterpark choice, and despite the long ques, he was not disappointed with the miriad of slides and tube rides ...  It was then dinner at KFC (a treat for me as there are none in Switzerland) and then bowling, followed by some goes at the Dance Dance video game machine.

459923,3751152,2004-08-07,"So here I am, bloggin live from B10!  Its only my second day ever in England, but luckily the learning curve is not as steep as worried about :)  The fun all started on Friday, when I awoke at 3am after only 4 hours of sleep to drive to Zurich, where I would meet Reethi and Sunshine and catch a flight to merry olde England.  The day started out with lousy weather. Most of my driving was through rain and I could only hope that my decision to have brought only warm weather clothing would not be a horrible mistake. About 5.30 am, I arrived at the Zurich airport, parked the car, found the check in termal, changed some francs to pounds and waited for my two travel companions to show up. Luckily, they were not too late.  Sunshine looked the same as ever, but Reethi came with a new hairstyle, now without the blue..  The plane ride to London was for the most part uneventful..we nodded off a bit, but I awoke to discover us in a circling delay to land in London Heathrow.  Although we were delayed a bit, I enjoyed the circling pattern as I got to take in some of the sights of London from the air.  I even recogniyed the snaking bit of the Thames that one sees at the start of every Eastender episode!  Eventually, we landed, and we took the next leg of our trip southward starting with the Underground Tube.  Thus, I also got to see London from below ground - although I admit there was not much to see except a lot of people packed like Sardines reading their morning papers which either talked about the English football coach being cleared of his latest problems, or the more amazing revelation that one of the Big Brother candidates was actually a man earlier in life, but female now.  The headline read, ""Father of Big Brother candidate - I always wanted a daughter!!!""  When we reached Picadilly circus, it was time to change from the Tube to the Train. Now, as a faithful follower of the Chevy Chase Vacation movies, I remembered Picadilly Circus as this huge roundabout, which Americans seemed doomed forever to drive around in circles in.  I looked forward to seeing it and Big Ben, but alas all we had time to do after getting our tickets was to get a Burger King Breakfast to go.  We took our seats and we were finally southward bound to Bomo!  A few naps later and a few scares from some clouds, we arrived close to the MudMeet Mecca.  As we stopped in Christchurch, we noticed Ginge, Zebedee, and Trax walk bz. Christoph banged on the window, but Ginge in his dark glasses could not see us frantically waving at him.  The train went off to its next stop, where Sunshine and Reethi departed to check into their hotel and I went on to Pool and finally got the other spodders attention in their car though a text message.  Finally, Parkstone came!  It was a much smaller trainstation than I had expected.  But probably it was good as it was small as Matt's place was literally right next to it.  There I quickly found old faces such as Lorena Huxley, while meeting new spods in person for the first time, although it could feel quite strange, having spent hundreds of virtual hours with them.  People were just finishing breakfast despite it being more like 1pm.  We broke up into a couple of groups - one consisting mainly of women for shopping - and the rest at the pub next door.  I opted for the latter option and found myself quickly going through beer after beer - and then cider (not the American apple juice type) - and quickly worked up a buzz as spod after spod appeared.  I found the people quite easy to chat up and met a few non spodders, including a woman from the English Birmingham, which I found interesting, as my last job in America was in the other Birmingham (Alabama).  Finally, it was time to move on to the event of the evening - B2.  This was a small, but nice pub with a single pool table - which seemed like something for children as it was smaller than the standard Americna pool table.  The B9 tournament was finally finished, with Dafty beating out host Matt.  Games of Twister were to be had, but I never managed to get past 3rd place, despite my trainings in yoga.  Although most were wide awake, my early morning start was starting to get to me, combined with the heavy fish and chips I had for dinner.  I had to take a walk outside to clear my head. About midnight, we headed back to Matt's and listened to his heavy beats, including the favorite, ""Fire Wire.""  I was dead tired and managed to actually get some sleep despite the loud music.  Everyone crashed around 3am.  Saturday morning started with me being the lucky second for a shower, giving me plenty of time to enjoy a ""Vegetarian Breakfast"" at the small coffee spot down the street.

459924,3751152,2004-08-02,"Sometimes I might refer to my biological father, Gary, as Biodad when I'm talking about him. I kind of like it. It has a superhero quality tone to it (Up in the sky! It's a bird! It's a plane! It's... Biodad!) The reason I refer to him that way is because I've only known him for the past few years and most of that was just via email.  I grew up knowing of him, but he wasn't a part of my life. I had a wonderful stepdad who was and always will be my 'dad' and so I can't quite bring myself to refer to Gary as dad and I don't think I ever could. So I like Biodad. Anyway, after my dad passed away I began to feel curious about Biodad. But I didn't really pursue it. It wasn't anything more than an 'I wonder what he's like' curiosity anyway. All I knew of him was his name, that he and my mother went to high school together and dated for a bit and I was the result. A typical story really. I also knew he worked for a newspaper in Montana. That's it.  Well around 1999 or 2000, I can't recall which, I stumbled onto his address and email online when I put his name in on a lark. On a whim I decided to contact him via email and just see what happened. I figured it would be nice to know whether he would care or if he didn't want anything to do with me. That way I'd never go through life just wondering. I'm so grateful I did.  I wrote to him, though I can't recall exactly what I said. I do remember saying something along the lines of 'I promise not to drag you onto Jerry Springer for a surprise reunion' or something to that effect. Nervousness brings out the comic in me. Anyway he found that amusing and after the shock of my email wore off we began corresponding. Then I introduced him to instant messaging and we began actually chatting. I found I had a sister just a little older than my own daughter whom Gary brought with him the first time we all met. It was just a dinner at Applebee's that first time but it was very pleasant if a little bit awkward :)  Since then we've talked a lot more and hooked up a time or two when he's in town. His own father, who would be my grandfather lives here in my town, though I've yet to meet him. He's retired and I'd occasionally see him doing the greeter thing at Walmart - I imagine he did that to get out of his wife's hair :) It was weird seeing him knowing who he was, but he didn't know who I was. Very odd feeling.  So that's a bit of background on Biodad and the reason I'm writing all of this is because I think a new step has been passed after his last visit this past week. I miss him now. It's another weird feeling. He and his wife have divorced in the time that we've been writing to each other, and he has a new girlfriend now. This past week was his family's renunion in another city here in nebby so he brought her down with him for the week and stayed at a hotel across the street from my place. This meant we got to spend a lot more time with them. I adore his gf and think she's really cool - she's a junior high school teacher which means she was able to get along really well with my junior high school kid and both of them were incredibly supportive for me while I was going through this whole job thing.  It marked the first time I went to him for advice and support and he came through for me bigtime. It also marked the first time he spent time with my daughter without me around as they ""borrowed"" her for the day and took her with them as they did an 'About Schmidt' tour of Nebraska, hitting the pioneer museums, the Imax, a planetarium and all that stuff. My kidlet told me later that night that she had an absolute blast hanging out with them. Later that evening they met me for dinner which happened to be on the day of my interview and then we retired to the lobby of their hotel while Gary restrung her new guitar with some nylon strings he bought for her and showed her how to use the electric tuner he also bought her. Then they had a few lessons which I managed to capture  urlLink here  :)  Unfortunately after that they had to get going to the reunion but yesterday as they passed through my town on their way back to Montana we were able to see them again for a quick coffee. And now today I find myself really missing them and wishing they lived closer or we lived closer. I'd like to get to know his daughter better because from what I know of her, she's a pretty incredible kid - a music wiz, a science wiz, wants to be a published novelist before she turns 21... I think that's really cool.  The other times we met Gary for a quick dinner and a stroll through a park it was really nice and all but I didn't have the feeling afterwards that I do now. Maybe because we simply didn't have a lot of time to really get to know each other in person and even though chatting online is nice and convenient - it's still just not the same as being there.  Anyway I'd better wind this up. I thought I'd write about it because you always see those long-lost reunions on TV where the reunited family members greet each other after years apart, or after meeting for the first time but you never get to really know what happens after that initial meeting. So this was my story :)",male,27,Technology,Capricorn,0
459925,3751152,2004-08-01,"CamdenTown is a part of London which became famous in the sixties and was a regular hang-out for lotsa rock stars. Since then it's become a place which attracts all manner of freaks (as well as plenty of tourists) coming to embrace Camden's alternative feel and shop in the markets. So I guess it was only natural that my first encounter with Camden would be at a TCZ meet back in 1997.  Well 7 years on here I am living in Camden - having been here for over a year and much as I love where I live, there's one small part of Camden that REALLY riles me up. It's a small stretch of road starting at Camden Tube and progressing about 200-300 metres up towards Camden lock. This is where the markets are and many, many shops selling things like clothes, shoes, tattoos and food (including magic mushrooms). And it's on this small stretch of road that a large number of people descend every weekend - so many people that they have to close Camden tube on a Sunday to make it exit only.  Now I don't mind lots of people, I've had to catch the tram back into Manchester after a United match with about 40,000 other people. What really annoys me is people who seem to have an inability to walk properly or to be aware of everyone around them. These people seem to meander on at a snail's pace obvlivious to those of us who just want to get home. They stop randomly in large groups which means you have to walk in the road just to get past them. Or they decide to stagger themselves right across your path and have a discussion about which shop to go in. They stop to take photos, with the photographer standing like 2 metres away from the photographee and then getting stroppy when people walk in the way. So I'm pretty frustrated by constantly having to negotiate this slalom course of idiots and I'd imagine they all think I have tourettes with the amount of evil glares and muttered curses ;)  And then, when I've just about made it to Camden lock I have to endure the drunk punks, the leafleters, the weed salesmen and today a nice man selling what initially looked like cakes his grandma had made - how sweet I thought, having only baked some fairy cakes myself yesterday. Well, I'm sure you can guess, these cakes would have you seeing more than fairies! His selling slogan was ""Hash cakes - get seriously fucked up for only a pound"".  So welcome to my world, and the small part of it that can seriously piss me off within seconds. But much as I hate this part of Camden, I know one day I'll be grateful when I'm going to a fancy dress party where the theme is goth/punk/freak - I know I'll definitely be able to get an outfit ;)",male,27,Technology,Capricorn,0
459926,3751152,2004-08-01,"So as I write this blog, daylight is rapidly disappearing, but definitely not the activity with it outside.  For this is the Swiss National Day, or as it seems for all the neighbor kids, fireworks day.  Actually, many did not wait till today. I heard many a firework exploding last night as well as throughout the day. But only now is it getting really loud.  Surprisingly, it does not seem that much different than the USA 4th, but instead of red, white, and blue, there are only the first two colors.  The Swiss channels are filled with music from the 4 different cultural areas of Switzerland.  Throughout the mountains, one can probably see many a bonfire.  I'm not Swiss of course, so for me its a manner of curiousity.  Perhaps a bit of annoyance, in that its a holiday that I don't get off as I work in Liechtenstein, and only live in Switzerland, but it doesn't really matter as it fell on a Sunday this time.  Incidently, I don't get the Liechtenstein holiday off either in 2 weeks as it will be on a Sunday as well. Oh well.  So how am I spending my Swiss Day?  Doing nothing..or close to it.  I woke up with a back ache that was most likely caused by my running down a mountain on Saturday at full speed. Thus, it was filled with me playing the odd computer game and lots of television, including 3 hours worth of East Enders on BBC Prime.  Amazing, how I managed to get myself hooked to that series.  So, a week from now I shall be at BOMO if all goes to plan.  It should be a nice change of place from the Swiss way of things :)",male,27,Technology,Capricorn,0

473446,2240106,2003-11-15,"hehe...i'm back, nah, jux for a while only..... i was going through my mailbox and i came across this msg, which i found really touching....i know christmas ain't here yet but no time is too early for christmas, everyday can be a day of giving and sharing, of peace and joy. i hope anyone who comes across this entry will like this christmas story.  remember, all it takes is one small touch to change a person's life forever.....   A Touching Christmas Story On the last day before Christmas, I hurried to go to the supermarket to buy the gifts I didn't manage to buy earlier. When I saw all the people there, I started to complain to myself:  'It is going to take forever here and I still have so many other places to go...'  Christmas really is getting more and more annoying every year. How I wish I could just lie down, go to sleep and only wake up after it. Nonetheless, I made my way to the toy section, and there I started to curse the prices, wondering if kids really play with such expensive toys. While looking in the toy section, I noticed a small boy of about 5 years old, pressing a doll against his chest. He kept on touching the hair of the doll and looked so sad. I wondered who this doll was for.  Then the little boy turned to the old woman next to him: 'Granny, are you sure I don't have enough money?' The old lady replied: 'You know that you don't have enough money to buy this doll, my dear.' Then she asked him to stay here for 5 minutes while she went to look around. She left quickly. The little boy was still holding the doll in his hand. Finally, I started to walk towards him and asked who he wanted to give this doll to. 'It is the doll that my sister loved most and wanted so much for this Christmas. She was so sure that Santa Claus would bring it to her.' I replied to him that maybe Santa Claus will bring it to her, after all, and not to worry. But he replied to me sadly. 'No, Santa  Claus can not bring it to her where she is now. I have to give the doll to my mother so that she can give it to her when she goes there.' His eyes were so sad while saying this.  'My sister has gone to be with God. Daddy say that Mummy will also go to see God very soon, so I thought that she could bring the doll with her to give it to my sister'.   My heart nearly stopped.  The little boy looked up at me and said: 'I told daddy to tell mummy not to go yet. I asked him to wait until I come back from the supermarket' Then he showed me a very nice photo of him where he was laughing. He then told me: 'I also want mummy to take this photo with her so that she will not forget me.'  I love my mummy and I wish she doesn't have to leave me but daddy says that she has to go to be with my little sister' Then he looked again at the doll with sad eyes, very quietly.  I quickly reached for my wallet and took a few notes and said to the boy. 'What if we checked again, just in case if u have enough money?'  'Ok' he said. 'I hope that I have enough.' I added some of my money to his without him seeing and we started to count it. There was enough for the doll, and even some spare money. The little boy said: 'Thank you God for giving me enough money' then he looked at me and added: 'I asked yesterday before I slept for God to make sure I have enough money to buy this doll so that mummy can give it to my sister. He heard me' 'I also wanted to have enough money to buy a white rose for my mummy, but I didn't dare to ask God too much. But He gave me enough to buy the doll and the white rose.'  'You know, my mummy loves white rose'  A few minutes later, the old lady came again and I left with my trolley. I finished my shopping in a totally different state from whenI started. I couldn't get the little boy out of my mind. Then I remembered a local newspaper article 2 days ago, which mentioned of a drunk man in a truck who hit a car where there was one young lady and a little girl. The little girl died right away, and the mother was left in a critical state.The family had to decide whether to pull the plug on the life-assisting machine, because the young lady would not be able to get out of the coma. Was this the family of the little boy?  Two days after this encounter with the little boy, I read in the newspaper that the young lady had passed away.  I couldn't stop myself and went to buy a bunch of white roses and I went to the mortuary where the body of the young woman was exposed for people to see and make last wish before burial. She was there, in her coffin, holding a beautiful white rose in her hand with the photo of the little boy and the doll placed over her chest. I left the place crying, feeling that my life had been  changedforever. The love that this little boy had for his mother and his sister is still, to that day, hard to imagine. And in a fraction of a  second, a drunk man had taken all this away from him.",female,17,indUnk,Aries,1

Haven't been very good at bio all along....praying like siao that I wun do too badly for it....need at least a B3 .... *shrugs*  guess this means I wun be sleeping for the next few nights....call me paranoid if you want to but I'm like this only when my results are concerned ok........They mean a lot to me, much as I hate to say this but in this world, what defines you (especially when it comes to job hunting), is still what is written on your report slip. Sad ain't it?? You can be the world's nicest person but without good grades to show, people would still be looking at you with disdain.  *sighzzz........* our reputation lies in the hands of others, much as we hate it but how people look at us matters. Reputation is really something that no one can afford to be fooling around with...........  can you imagine? If one day( dun get offended, it's jux a hypothesis...) someone discovered that Mother Theresa used to work in a carbaret, (forgive me...) as a can can girl, would people still have looked up to her as they had before? Maybe after witnessing her miracles, yes, but before?? No, people would probably be trampling on her and label her a sinner! Yes, such is life, cruel but true.  *sighzz*  wonder why people are more impressed by a Harvard degree than another of  equal standing local university degree? Cause' Harvard is famous for producing good students though not all who come out from there are equally good. When you enter Harvard, you are just paying to graduate with its letterhead, employers are impressed even if your results are mediocre, while another graduate from a local university would have to work doubly hard, score doubly well just to get the same kind of recognition a Harvard graduate have.  *shrugs and shakes head* nothing in this world is fair, guess we'll just have to accept. Only on Judgement Day, will everyone be judged for our deeds and faith. only then, will it really be fair.",female,17,indUnk,Aries,1

XX resolution for the year, travel more. yeah, gonna try and save as much as i can then go travel every year... haha! yeah, travel every year. not the package tours that like cost a bomb lah, i'll go free and easy, go back packing... ;) sounds like fun right?? yeah, it has been a long tern dream of mine already, but i was too young before so i couldn't fulfill it, but now, i'm 16 going on 17, i think my folks trust me well enough to travel on my own... resolution no. XX+1, get a digital camera before i go travelling, one with all the works and stuff. i wanna go take pictures of the places i've visited, enlarge my photo collection. most the shots i've taken so far are all centralised in singapore. i call them the  'Images Of Singapore Through My Lens'   next up, gonna enlarge the collection and call it,  'The World Through My Eyes'  haha...i know the name is a lil' cliche but i like it, too bad.   Resolution no. (XX+1)+1, i'll be less stubborn and be a lil' more tactful... lolx =D kinda hard la, but i can always try can't i? hrm, think its about time i curb my stubbornness...it can cause quite a lot of trouble sometimes...and being a lil' more tactful would most definately help in everyday life too. hiya, in short, i wish to be a better person for this year la! i'll learn to appreciate the lil' things in life and learnt to love life more with each passing day. people come and people go, instead of feeling bitter, i'll learn to be thankful for the things that they have brought into my life and the lessons that they have taught me so well. for this new year, i'll learn to love the Arts more, any aspect of it. =) a few black sheeps aren't worth sacrificing my love for the Arts. let it be music, dance or stage, they are all different people's ways of expressing themselves. i guess the Arts is the freedom of expression of the individual. i'll learn to appreciate that expression and love that freedom.   ok, think i'll just stop here...my reflection is getting to be really long. lolx  =D think this is gonna be a pretty good year ahead so,  HAPPY NEW YEAR blog!",female,17,indUnk,Aries,1

473467,2240106,2004-05-30,"hrm...I'm bored. Yup,you got that right, I'm bored. I jux realize I've got a very passionate boyfriend, passionate about music that is. Once he starts playing he practically forgets the whole world except his music. Sometimes  I really can't help but wonder if this is a good thing or a bad thing. Well, no matter wad, I love him still. I guess this was why I was attracted to him on the first place, his passion for much and the way he interprets it is really beautiful, he's got a beautiful mind although it gets a little crowd at times and I can't read into it but still I think its beautiful... =)oh man, I miss him........  anyway, enough of him. I was reading this book on Chinese history just a while ago before I came online(the translated and shortened version that is...)and sad as this is gonna sound. I found it rather absurd, the Confucius part that is. I mean I'm a history student by choice and I love reading up about it. I haven't studied history in depth (well, they dun offer it to poly students...)but I did do it for 4 years and I'm a pretty good history student(I think...). I've read about historical events of the world since I'm in primary school man! History is the story about dead people but it is also a lesson learned and trialed by time. Well, I'm moving away from wad I wanted to start tying about about in the first place so, uh hrm, I'm back.   as I was saying, I was reading up about the history of china from the beginning to the three kingdoms. I gotta say, I found it very interesting except for the part that Confucius had in the place of Chinese history. China's history is the history of the world. Its dynasty rises and falls and it has gone through more battles and treachery than most of the western countries have gone through or encountered, I can proudly say, I'm proud of the rich history I have as a Chinese but the part where Confucius came in really sucked man! He set up some rules and protocols governing the way of life of the people that (I believe anyway...) totally made life unbearable. What Confucius had in china was what Stalin had created for Lenin, a cult culture. Thankfully he didn't do it on purpose or for his own gain or the consequences would have been unthinkable...But still, oh gosh! Emperors followed his ideas blindly and so fervently that the absurdity and stupidity of the whole idea simply astonished me. A lot of Confucius ideas were on the individual's role and responsibility in society. Men are suppose to work and support the family while the wives stay at home and have no life of their own. Their whole life is dedicated to their parents, siblings, husband then children. She had no life of her own, her whole life revolved around others. Their male counterparts role is about the same except that he had to provide for the family as well and more emphasis was placed on filial piety. There was an incident cited in the book that really struck me. a soldier deserted his camp 3 times so that he could go home to look after his father was praised by his officials for his filial piety while the others that died in his place received none of that. Now, imagine this, what if half of the active serving troops decide to desert camp for the same reason? Who the hell would be left to fight the ongoing war? If there aren't enough people serving in the frontlines, everyone else back home would probably get slaughtered after the invasion and life of a thousand would be lost because of these 'filial' sons, what good is filial piety if you're probably gonna die for it? And need I remind you, this happened during the Spring and Autumn period. It was a time of war and turbulence. Can u imagine if that is to be applied into today's life? =S   sadly, I can't totally disagree with Confucius. His ideas formed the very basis of the Chinese lifestyle and beliefs. Without him, I(we) probably won't be what we are today. His ideas suited the people and leaders then. It was something different and most importantly, it gave them a sense of direction and purpose. When war has ended, soldiers had have nothing more to look out for, families have nothing to fear or worry about anymore, not that people especially loved war and unrest, everybody looks forward to peace and prosperity but when one suddenly has nothing to think or worry about, life suddenly becomes aimless. Confucius ideas were the basic building blocks of many dynasties. It gave the rulers and the people something to work on and believe in rather than have to start everything right from scratch. Its not that easy. One's culture and beliefs takes time to form, like civilisations but dynasties some and go, they fall and they rise again. They get replaced by something else more sophisticated each time before time catches up and modernisation takes place, replacing dynasties with communism, socialism, capitalism so on and so forth. But if u'd look back carefully, maybe you'd realize what we have today was built on what was lost yesterday. The very basis of our ways of governing, yes is more up to date and more humane but if you take away the modern terms and facades, one might find himself/herself face to face with a method or way of government that has existed way before the word democracy even came about.   I guess what I'm trying to put across here is that to some people, history is just the study of events and people(mostly dead) of the past. It holds no link or reference to the modern world we live in, therefore a useless subject(as some of my friends and relatives have said..."" might as well study geography! More use !"") but don't forget, if not for yesterday, there might be no tomorrow, don't take your own history for granted, you are what you are today because of what happened yesterday.",female,17,indUnk,Aries,1

There are a thousand and one possibilities to a single situation, so y not just give it a try? Even if I do end up in the blobbers segment, I would rest in peace knowing that I've done my best AMEN! I guess I'll survive just fine, I mean what's there to fear? I know I'm gonna have Wendy there to support me (oh yeah, she's taking part too!! YEAH!!) and a whole bunch of pals at home waving their pom-poms, drumming up a song of victory and courage for the both of us so yeah, I think we're gonna do just fine if u know what I mean...  My Simpson fever has just reached a new height upon the discovery of the Simpson video online and as I'm typing this entry, my computer is busily trying to cope with the amount of Simpson video I've lined up to be downloaded. Its really quite scary judging by the number of remotely queued videos I've got but hey, how often is it that I would actually sit down and do this? Once in a blue moon lo...Its not that often that my boyfriend falls sick and I've got no one to hang out with...OOPS! Did I let the cat of the bag?? Hehe....Ok ok, maybe I had an ulterior motive for staying at home but the thing that really matters here is still that I stayed at home rite? I'm not the bad girl that everyone makes me out to be, I can be homely and stay at home too wad....hehe I'm starting to get bored, none of the videos wish to finish downloading...which translate to mean I'm probably not gonna get to watch them tonite. Oh yeah, did i mention i'm also downloading some episodes of the Charmed series? Yeah, so Kel? If u want them jux let me know and i'll send it over... Oh ya, i finally found The Nightmare Before Christmas too! But i'm not too sure if its gonna be the full movie or not. if its the full movie, i'm so gonna ask wendy to burn it for me man! i've looked all over Singapore for a copy of it but yes, to no avail. They've onli got it on DVD(i dun have a player at home tat supposrts it) but its all sold out lor! Or i would have bought it and dropped by my friend's place to watch it... ArGh.... Hrm...i think that's enuf grumbling for a day besides, i wanna go watch Jurassic Park le. So here's to u blog, GOOD NITE AND GOOD BYE!",female,17,indUnk,Aries,1

I don't think I'll ever love anyone as much ever again, no matter how hard I try. I'll always love Mun. He's the first pity he couldn't be the last...But he'll be the last person to ever make me cry this much ever again.... =) I'll be fine!  well, let's see...Orientation ended last nite with a bang man! There was a lot of dancing, especially in my part. haha. I was on the  dane floor almost all the time and yeah, I was wild man! haha... I guess I was dancing to get Mun off my mind...It really helps u know? To get ur body in this really super hyper and tired state then things seem to become so much simpler. so i did, i got myself totally soaked and tired out, actually all 3 days of orientation had been totally tiring but i guess it was fun la...i got tot know my class mates lo..haha. not all of them i like though...i don't like nicole and desmond for starters. they both got attitude sia! nicole has this unbearable air around her that really makes her irritating. her refusal to participate in the activities din help either, she's always so bz clicking away on her mobile and well, just irritating lo! =S desmond wasn't any better, he's very rude and totally no respect for the rest of the class. he doesn't help out during activities either and well, like nicole just plain attitude and irritating!! well, whatever lo. dun step on my toes or i'll make sure u regret ever knowing me lo. when i bitch, i'll go all out one so dun start me.",female,17,indUnk,Aries,1
473473,2240106,2004-06-13,"He...Just realize I haven't been updating my blog again lately... So I guess I'm back!   well, a lot of things happened this few weeks that I was away from my blog, so much that I dun really know where to start blogging about. First up, to everyone who have been messaging me but not receiving a reply, I'm really sorry guys, my phoneline got cut. Guess my dad failed to pay his part of the bill again...Well, wad to do? Anyway, where did I stop the last time? The Singapore idol part rite? Yeah, I think so. Well, lets see...I finally got in touch with this primary school friend of mine after a really long time. She's currently in India, waiting to do her A' levels. Her birthday's on the 4th of July(I almost forgot about that..) and yeah, I received her email last night and I managed to pull my fingers to work and typed her a pretty long mail updating her on my current happenings for the past 3 months?? hahaha...Not an easy task I tell you... I haven't seen mum in a week already and I miss him so badly but no matter how bad I know its probably never gonna be as bad as how much wendy's missing kailun.     I HATE tHAT GUY!!!    he went to cathay when Wendy was working with this dumb bitch lor and I guess it really got on wendy's nerves. She broke down and called me(I was sleeping at that moment...)and started sobbing. I mean, fuck him la! I really didn't have a bloody clue as in to what she wants me to do lor. He's a fucking asshole and she knows that, we(kel and I) warned her about him and giving him another chance again but she didn't quite register our words and now this. What do you want me to do? No, put it this way, what the fucking hell can I do? I wanna kick his ass lor but I'm not there and he's probably not worth the effort. Who would be happy to hear something like that happen? Especially when you've already predicted the ending but no one gave a damn about it. So fine, I let you go ahead and do what you think is right and best for you. Hey, its your life man! I'm in no control of it, I dun want to be. So yeah, I let her go do what she wants and when she got hurt she came back to me, I didn't mind that part seriously, I dun mind that at all. She's almost like a sister to me, I'll die for her if I had to but what can I do? I'm at home, she's at work, crying for some asshole that nobody really likes. Worse still, why is she crying? cause'he went to the movies with a pretty girl. Well, told you it was gonna happen. Been there, done that. Then what happen, she said she tink she called the wrong person, I got admit, I didn't sound like I cared but you know what? You needed to talk so I let you, what am I to do? I can feel this thing boiling inside of me, if I actually spoke more than what I did that day I'd probably end up scolding her and when I say scold I really mean it. Its probably gonna make her feel 10x worse lor, so why bother? Lets just say I'm not exactly the best kinda friend you'd wanna have lo. In fact, I think I'm a lousy person altogether. I believe in letting people do what they wanna do and hopefully they'll learn their lesson from there.    give a man a fish, it'll feed him for a day.  teach a man to fish, it'll feed him a lifetime.   so yeah, that's what I did but more than often I get blamed for allowing things to happen although I knew it was gonna happen. I get blamed for leaving people in the lurch and not being the sympathic friend. Well, guess what? Its ok, I'm used to it! Blame me for all the fucking problems you have, for not being understanding, for not knowing sympathy etc etc etc...I'm used to it. I'm fine with it. I live my whole darn fucking life for others. I've lived my whole life trying to be what others want me to be but know what? I never quite make the cut. I love my friends, I'd make myself look bad if it makes them look or feel good but you know what? Its still not quite good enough. I dunno what else to do...or maybe I should just stop doing anything, I should just stop trying, I know its definitely gonna make my life a lot easier...",female,17,indUnk,Aries,1

481561,3751913,2004-06-30,"Every morning, I drive 40 minutes to work. This would normally be much more tolerable than it actually is, had my coffee not attacked my CD player early one day, and left me with mere radio as my sole companion. Rhonda the Honda, being the base model that she is, gets about 5 stations, and my commute is filled with a medley of soft rock, hardcore rap, and gospel.  On most mornings, I devise little games to entertain myself. My favorite game is when I pretend I'm in a music video, to whatever song happens to be on KOIT. This morning, that song was ""Ain't Nobody"", by Chaka Khan. This, being one of my favorite songs EVER, meant my twisted, psychotic pretend video had to rock. Don't worry. It did.  When I'm pretending I'm in a video, I'm not driving my car in the video. I'm in leather pants, I have a posse of scantily clad vixens, I kick men out of my way with my stiletto sling backs.  Oh, and I actually sing out loud. And by sing, I mean I belt it.   So, here I am, driving down Lombard Street, singing at the top of my lungs, hair flips abound, lost in my own vocal stylings and improvised riffs, and pretending I'm driving a Vanquish through the foggy streets of Manhattan.  Approaching a red light poses an interesting dilemma. I canât just stop. Iâm too invested. Iâm lost in the music, the strobe lights, the dry ice machine. Red lights can't stop my video. I fall further into the fantasy. âNow, weâre flying through the stars, I hope this night will last forever. Oh, Oh, Oh, Ohâ¦â And with this last key change, I turn towards the camera (driverâs side window) and open my eyes. Stopped next to me is a Land Rover filled with hot Marina yuppie scum, all staring at me. Theyâre not laughing. This is beyond merely singing along with the radio. This is beyond charmingly quirky. I can see it in their eyes. This is sad.  Suddenly, I was back in San Francisco, is my ghetto little car, feeling like a jackass.  I wish I had thrown a lit cigarette in their precious Rover. I wish I had laughed in their suburban Caucasian faces. I wish I had cranked up the Chaka, crawled on top of the car, and continued my video, before God and everyone.  But I didnât. I sank in my seat, changed the station to some dreadful Usher song about impregnating people, and prayed for a green light.  The worst thing about this is, my retarded pretend Chaka Khan video is a million times cooler than the 1997 episode of Suddenly Susan they were obviously pretending to be in. And Iâm the one that felt like an idiot.  Iâm being judged by a 35 year old man with highlights, and Iâm the loser.  Please.",female,26,Arts,Aquarius,1

Now that Carol, the prop lady, has returned all of the faux folliage and ""stylishly"" arranged it about the room, KFOG won't come on the radio anymore, due to the large basket of plastic squash placed atop the stereo. Thanks a million, Carol.  Normally, when it's just the kids in the office, Ben plays us a medely of hits on Rhapsody, his online music site. But Ben is gone, and Margot has us listening to some kind of acid jazz involving scat. Thanks a million, Margot. Thus, we're forced to try and hack into Rhapsody, guessing at what Ben's password might be. Ben, complex fellow that he is, isn't making this very easy for us. Damn you, Ben Coe Freak Show. Damn you.  We've tried, ""IwantMargot"" and ""IwantBeth"". To our shock, it's neither. Nor is it ""clay"", ""hippies"", or ""weed."" We're at a loss. So Ben, if you're reading this...

481563,3751913,2004-06-28,"The other day, my beloved living companion, Bonnie, called me at work and invited me to the Giants game. Apparently, her company, Gymboree, got a bunch of tickets somehow, and Bonnie grabbed us two. Having no idea who else from Gymbo was going, and quite frankly, not really caring, we threw on jeans and sweatshirts and cabbed it to Pac Bell. Upon arrival, we scoped the scene of thousands of baseball lovers entering the stadium and gave each other a knowing look. There were a lot of cute boys here, and not many cute girls. The odds were looking good.  Now, Iâm not a sports lover. Iâll scream and yell and do the wave, but Iâm not invested in who wins. I donât know the playerâs names or their stats. And, I really only applaud the good looking ones. But any event which combines libations and a ballpark filled with men is an event Iâm likely to attend.  Our seats were practically in the blimp circling the stadium, we were so high up. We hiked to our section, and made our way to the seats. Um, wait a second. There are two really cute guys in the seats right next to us, and theyâre already well on their way to drunk. We sit down, and share a second knowing look.  They are Butch and Rocco*, and they are hilarious. Butch is new to Gymbo, and as his lady-friend was unavailable, he brought along Rocco. Rocco is (â¦wait for itâ¦) a porn distributor. I take a sip from my water bottle filled with Merlot. This is going to be interesting.  By the 5th inning, Iâm freezing and tired of pretending to care about the game. Conveniently enough, Butch and Rocco are ready to leave as well, and kindly invite us to join them at a bar. With stifled giggles and many elbow nudges, Bonnie and I agree, and the 4 of us depart the stadium. Rocco has some dive bar in mind, and we follow him blindly for blocks until we reach The Eagleâs Lounge. The Eaglesâ Lounge is much like it sounds, a relic of a bygone era. Itâs the kind of place 1970âs Michigan union workers hang out in, complete with a juke box, pool table, and lone patron passed out at the bar. Bonnie discovered a cozy nook with a dart board and a few booths, and we set up camp.  Butch and Rocco went off to get drinks, and as the only wine available was airline mini-bottle screw top, I opted for a Vodka and Cranberry.  We then proceeded to play a very intense and competitive game of darts. (âYou suck, Marin. You suck!â) Apparently, everyone else had been dart champions in previous lives, because comparatively, I did indeed suck. Who cares? Weâre getting drunk with random cute strangers.  Suddenly, a tray of Jaggermeister shots was placed before me. Guns and Roses blared from the juke box. Butch began to dance. I am a bar snob, much preferring the sophisticated ambiance of Le Colonial to the duct taped booths of the Eagleâs Lounge. But I have to admit, this place rocked. Soon after, the popular catchphrase was coined, âWhat happens in the Lounge, stays in the Lounge.â Hours later, we stumbled onto the sidewalk, clutching our companions yet knowing that we must leave them wanting more. After many hugs, phone number exchanges, and promises to do this again as soon as is humanly possible, they put us in a cab and waved goodbye. As we erupt into giggles, Bonnie looks over and says, âI love unexpected fun.â Well said, my morally ambiguous roommate. Well said.  * names have been changed to protect Bonnieâs co-workers.",female,26,Arts,Aquarius,1
481564,3751913,2004-06-28,"I spent Saturday morning in a hung-over haze, drinking coffee and hoping for a good movie on TBS or similar. I ended up watching The American Film Instituteâs Lifetime Achievement Award Tribute to Meryl Streep and it's opened a whole new world for me. Really, is there anything better than a 2 hour televised celebrity studded extravaganza whose sole purpose is public worship and adoration?   No, there isn't.   Thus, I've decided this is how I'd like my next birthday celebrated. I want an AFI Lifetime Achievement Tribute, staring me and my glorious celebrity friends and colleagues, full of video montages and tearful videotaped messages of love from the likes of Oprah Winfrey, Tom Hanks, and (gasp) Bill Murray. Oh, no. I want Bill to host, actually. And, each fabulous year of my life will be detailed and applauded, the audience enthralled by my dance recitals, touched by my personal tragedies, and inspired by my joie de vivre. All the while, I sit, swaddled in plaid taffeta (don't ask) behind a floral encrusted dais chugging Stag's Leap and pretending to be modest.  Oh look. Here comes George Clooney. He winks at me from the stage, shares some personal tidbits about our close and often written about friendship, and then chokes up as he recounts the first time he saw me across a crowded room at The Sundance Film Festival.  Wait. It's the cast of Friends doing a choreographed dance routine to a medley of my favorite songs. And, here we have Bill Clinton, so moved he can barely speak, save for referring to me as a ""confidant and close personal advisor."" He bows his head and touches his heart. There are no words. Finally, once the endless parade of Beth worship comes to an end, I must make my way past the thousands of admirers (Kevin Spacey, I can't believe you made it!) and onto the stage for my speech. Looking out into the crowd, a sea of adoring faces all turned to me, I begin. I thank my family, my dear friends, all the talented people I've ever worked with. I joke, I reminisce, I wink back at George Clooney. And when it's all finally over, my limo whisks me away to my top secret VIP after party at SkyBar, exclusively photographed by Vanity Fair. I make my entrance just as J-Lo is turned away at the door and I strut directly onto the dance floor, where I immediately begin to bust a move with Justin Timberlake and his back up dancers. I party till the wee hours, pass out amid a mountain of delivered bouquets, and awake poor and alone at 916A, the only clues as to the previous night's events being an empty bottle of Cristal and a mysterious hickey, rumored to be the mark of Clooney.  Bonnie, make it happen.",female,26,Arts,Aquarius,1

What is wrong with me? Why do I have such chemistry with queens? Why do straight men confuse and befuddle me, not just romantically but socially? I simply can't figure it out.  Thus, in an effort to expand my circle of penis-possessing pals, I will from this day forward, no longer patronize gay bars. While fabulous, friendly, and well stocked with hot boys, these establishments just serve to perpetuate my never-ending need to discuss Prada's new line and the universal hotness of Gale Harold.

I haven't heard this album since I was a little kid running around Sea Ranch, and all of a sudden, my childhood is flooding back. This is surprisingly intense. I'm trying to get ready to go out, but quite frankly, I don't want my ride to show up because I need to re-experience this album. Seriously. I'm about to cry. It's a sad day in the life of Beth when I'd rather spend a Saturday night making a fire and listening to Carly Simon instead of hitting the town with my friends.

481570,3751913,2004-07-30,"Not 10 minutes ago, I was walking downstairs to go crawl into the huge purple velvet chaise in the den and read my trashy novel, when I spotted a small object in the doorway of the guest bathroom. It was a fucking dead bird. Keep in mind, this isn't the first dead bird I've encountered while housesitting. Years ago, while at Judy and Jerry's old house in Sea Cliff, I was standing at the sink washing dishes when all of a sudden, a bird flew right into the window directly in front of me and then dropped 2 stories to the garden below. I ran onto the kitchen deck and looked down. The poor creature was twitching and erratically moving. Emma, a rotweiler who understands me like no one else, was going nuts, sniffing and barking at the dying bird. I decided to call my mother, a notorious animal hater, for advice. ""Ignore it till it dies, then toss it in the bushes."" This from the woman who sent me to 4th grade with chicken pox, telling everyone I had fleas. Carol Brady, she ain't. I couldn't stand to watch this bird in obvious hell, and I certainly couldn't forget about it, especially considering it had committed suicide right before my eyes. Should I call the SPCA? Should I put it out of it's misery? I had no idea. I looked back out into the garden and Emma was now playing with the bird. I couldn't tell if it was still alive. ""Emma, drop the bird. Drop it, honey."" Emma drops her plaything and runs upstairs and inside. I tip toe down to the garden to inspect the morbid scene. The bird, finally dead, was a mess of blood and feathers. In an act of what some might call bravery, and others, cruelty, I took a paper towel, and tossed the corpse into the neighbor's yard. Today, I found myself in a sadly similar situation. Hey, it worked the first time around. The dead bird, that'd be dead bird #2, is now resting in peace next door, in a bed of hydrangeas. You'd think I'd feel some sadness for the dead creature or some guilt for throwing dead animals into stranger's perfectly manicured gardens. Nope. All I feel is a sense of deja vu and an aversion towards poultry.",female,26,Arts,Aquarius,1

Bonnie, Zoe, Kate, Kelsey, and Alex came over to my big housesitting house, and we cooked a huge amazing meal, and drank bottles of wine. We talked about the elections and our careers and who we like and who we hate. We laughed and joked and debated. And then, we drunkenly made a million cookies and all crammed in the hot tub. Exhausted, everyone all piled out and went home together, at a reasonable hour, and I'm about to crawl into a huge cozy bed and watch my crime crap on TV and call Andy. I couldn't be happier.

481574,3751913,2004-07-27,"Yesterday, I was on the phone for awhile with my good friend, Kelsey. We came to the conclusion that really, all of our lives would be a lot easier without any men around. Thus, we propose this: Move all men to Australia. Based on birthday, each woman gets a yearly trip Down Under. (For example, Iâd be on the January 28th flight.) Murielâs Wedding is always the in-flight movie. All the men line up, and you get to pick one to bring back. Whenever youâre done with him, send him back at any time, or simply keep him until your next birthday. Then, trade up. What? It sounds a lot like slavery? Well, what do you think theyâve been doing to us for the last 2000 years?  This way, theyâre almost like pets. And hopefully, theyâll all develop those charming accents. Itâs win-win. Men should be delighted to be used only for sex and eye candy. We donât want your money. Weâre not even particularly interested in your thoughts. And we certainly donât need your mind-game bullshit. It all comes down to the nookie.  Now, if you find a good one, ladies, you may approach the Estrogen Alliance (made up of 12 brilliant women) and apply for a man permit. A man permit allows you a 5 year window to see if heâs worth the trouble. Because, as we all know, they can rock for a few months, but when the honeymoon is over, suddenly youâre opening your own goddamn door. If, at any time during the 5 years, you realize that this man is just like every other asshole, you may return him. You will also have the option of tattooing a note on his body somewhere, so that other women on other flights will know heâs a jerk.  If, by some freak chance, you and he spend 5 years in bliss, then you may apply for Permanent Man Status (PMS), which would be quite rare. This gets a little more complicated, as now females have to collectively agree that this man is worthy of living permanently amongst women. There is a world-wide vote (obviously, Australia is excluded) and the results are televised. Keep in mind, with PMS, you give up your seat on all flights Down Under. Obviously, some details need to be worked out. With no women in Australia, who dresses them? I mean, they need to look cute when we come for selection. Also, what about the gays? I propose they should be allowed to live amongst the women. Theyâve been nothing but good to us throughout history, and have been screwed by the straights as well.  Now, I know some good men, and I'm sure you do too. Prior to shipping them all off, you may make a case for your guy friends or current boyfriend. However, keep in mind that their history as it pertains to women will be debated hotly.  Regardless, Kelsey and I are ready to put this plan into action immediately. Weâre currently in talks with prominent Australian women. We seek your support and look forward to a land in which women can live truly free.",female,26,Arts,Aquarius,1

481578,3751913,2004-07-26,"Last night, I was walking Marilyn, the gorgeous golden retriever that Iâm dogsitting. As you know, weâre up in the hills of Mill Valley, and I like to walk her along the windy roads and trails in the neighborhood. Along we walk, minding our own business, when suddenly, Marilyn reacts to a rustling in the bushes. Now, Marilyn reacting to anything is pretty exciting, so I immediately look over, and there, standing 10 feet away and staring directly at us, is a huge deer with monstrous antlers. This thing was a beast. I was probably eye to eye with it, and itâs antlers added another 2 or 3 feet.  Marilyn didnât move. I didnât move. The deer didnât move. We all stood, staring at one another. I tried to remember what youâre supposed to do in these situations. With a bear, youâre supposed to make yourself bigger. Or, are you supposed to stay still? I canât remember. But, this was a deer anyway. The only deer rule I know is that if youâre driving and youâre about to hit a deer, donât swerve. Hit it. But, what do you do if youâre walking? I stood there, silently reviewing all information I had regarding wild beast emergencies. Turns out, very little.  The deer took a step closer.  âGet lost!â I scream. âScram!â  Yeah. I said scram. The only other time Iâve ever even heard someone say âScramâ was Carla on Cheers, telling her hockey playing boyfriend to skedaddle. Who knew I had a scram in me? Regardless, my screaming did nothing. Weâre now 9 feet away from each other, still staring. I decide that we canât just stand here all day. I mean, I want to go see The Notebook. Iâve got my tissues all ready. Iâve got to shake a leg. So, I decide that weâll casually continue our walk. Fuck it. If the deer, reacts, so be it.  Marilyn and I take not 2 steps, when the deer runs out of the bushes and onto the road, now about 4 feet from us. I could practically touch him, he was so close. (I might be an idiot, but I do know that only boy deer have antlers. Pretty good, huh.) My stunned silence turned uncontrollably into a scream.  âOh my god, get the fuck out of here! Go!â And, with that last scream, I king of threw the leash (still attached to Marilyn, mind you) at the deer. That was all he needed. He turned off running down the hill, knocking down trees and causing general mayhem.  âWow. Marilyn. That was exciting, huh?â She looks at me with disgust. I could see it in her eyes.  âI was still attached to the leash, bitch. What the fuck? Were you sacrificing me?â âMarilyn, no, no, no. I would never. It was the only thing I could throw. Donât worry. Iâll totally protect you.â  But we all know thatâs bullshit. Take the dog. Have your way with her. Just let me go.",female,26,Arts,Aquarius,1

Sirens wiz by every three seconds, and thereâs always about 20 drunk and high Mexican men sitting out front at all hours of the day. This is where I feel perfectly safe.  Now, Iâm in a huge, 4 story house, with funky passages and noises and many, many possible points of entry for rapists, murderers, and deranged maniacs. Iâm high up in the mountains, and while my screams would echo beautifully into the valley, no one would come running.  Last night, I lay in bed watching Cold Case Files well into the night. The episode was about this serial killer, who would mutilate his victims before raping and then killing them. Suddenly, the floorboards creaked upstairs.  Now, the dog Iâm dog-sitting, Marilyn, wouldnât bark if 80 masked gunmen stormed in and started shooting up the place. She stayed silently by my side, as I reminded myself that the last murder in Mill Valley was in, like, 1957. The floorboards creaked again. This is a big, wooden house. Of course itâll make noises. Right? I decided to call Andy for comfort and reassurance.  âCome over and protect me.â  âHell no.â he replied. âIâm watching Cold Case Files.

Thatâs what I need. To hear my best friend get murdered.â  âYeah, but heâll mutilate and rape me before he murders me. You might have time to call the cops.â  With the phone in my hand, Marilyn at my side, and a wire clothes hanger, I tip toe upstairs. I double lock and deadbolt the door, check all the decks, and rustle all the clothes in the closets to make sure no oneâs hiding behind them.  âAre you dead yet?â  âFuck you.â  Clearly, no one is here.

Lore has it, there's a magical place there called The Bargain Barn, where clothing is a mere $1 a pound. We planned to hit The BB, and then peruse the other shops in town. After an intensely boring drive, our only form of entertainment being a book entitled, ""What's Your Favorite..."" and then pages and pages of categories you could have a favorite in. I think we hit rock bottom with ""What's your favorite witnessed act of Christian love. (I shit you not. Ask Katherine.)  We finally arrive, and as the BB doesn't open until 1, we go have lunch at a little bistro called 99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall, in which, if you drink all 99 beers available there over any amount of time, you get your name and a quote on a little plaque. Our favorite: William Kendall, August 16th, 1996, âI just came in to use the bathroom.â  Finally, we drive to the Bargain Barn, and after much query and walking, discover the mighty structure. Made of plastic siding and held together with luggies, the BB is like nothing Iâve ever seen before. Skis, beds, stuffed animals, all strewn everywhere. It looked like the front lawn of a huge Appalachian familyâs encampment. We paid a mighty $2.50 for the privilege of entering this sanctuary, obtained the coveted sticker of entry, and soon joined a group of about 20 others proudly wearing their stickers as well. The big room of crap smelled, as homeless punks, thrift store owners, and illegal immigrants rummaged through barrels of filth. Needless to say, I was not getting into this at all. Then, some âemployeeâ, wearing a t-shirt with the hand-scrawled âfavorite petâ, decided to blast The B52âs. It was deafening, but awesome. I started to sing along, and here I could sing at the top of my lungs. I began to rummage with fervor while harmonizing to âDeadbeat Club.â  Suddenly, I was finding great shit. And by great, I mean, worth well over a buck a pound. I started pulling sweaters and handbags and hats. People toss with abandon, clothes are everywhere, and itâs a madhouse with a soundtrack. You have to dig at the BB. Many items are appalling. Katherine found a cardigan with a used band-aid attached. But when you find a treasure, itâs a high like no other. My treasure was a huge straw hat, the brim at least 3 feet wide. It is fabulous and movie star-like and I immediately began to imagine myself wearing it in the South of France.  The next thing I know, there a woman with horrible gray roots screaming at Katherine and I. Weâre apparently stolen from her âpile.â From our arms, she proceeds to grab âherâ stuff, including my prized straw hat.  âI do this for a living. I wouldnât be such a bitch, but this is my job. You canât take from peopleâs piles. Itâs just the way it works.â  I was livid. âWell, then. Anything else I can offer you? Do you like my handbag? Maybe this jacket? My grandmotherâs earrings? Seriously, take all you want. Claim the earth as your pileâ¦â I was really yelling, attempting to make a point over the B52âs. She tried to ignore me and walked away. All I could think of was my hat. My beautiful straw hat. Katherine tried to perk me up with used sequin jumpsuits, but I was still devastated over the theft of my accessory.  Then, the thief has the audacity to approach us again, and inquire as to her missing beads.  âI canât hear you.â I say. âIâm too depressed about my hat.â  She looks up. âOh, that big straw hat? Fine. You can have it.â  I violently shove her out of the way as I dive into her pile and retrieve the hat that was destined to be mine.  âNope. We have no idea where your shitty beads are. Later, skank.â  And with that, we grabbed our wad of recovered garbage, me proudly wearing my hat all the way to the weigh station, and departed the Bargain Barn.

At work, I was barely able to function, I was so madly in love with him. Seriously, I cannot express to you how much I adored David. We'd hang out at Capp's for hours, him with his Newcastle, me with my vodka tonic and lots of lime, talking about England and fashion and how much work sucked. He could read me the dictionary, with that accent. Just keep talking... I could go on for days, but I digress. Anyway, things sucked so much at Beach Blanket that David quit (in a dramatic and bold storming out that is still spoken of in hushed tones), left his wife, and joined the military. I mean really, could he get any hotter? He'd return periodically, in magical and fabulous ways, but I haven't seen him in, like, 2 years.  The last time I ran into him, Zoe and I were watching a friend's band perform at the Lost and Found Saloon in North Beach. All of a sudden, I see the BBB sound guy, Rick, walk in with this beyond foxy creature in a white dress shirt and perfect khakis. Rick comes over and starts talking to us, while his mysterious, hot friend is at the bar. All of a sudden, a vodka tonic with lots of lime slides right up in front of me. I looked up and it was David. Zoe magically disappears from the seat next to me, goes outside to call her husband and explain why we'll now be home incredibly late, and leaves me to drool over David. He was marvelous, hilarious, and as always, fabulously flirty. I kissed him goodbye for about an hour, and that's the last I ever saw of him.

This visit was spent getting an extension for Jury Duty, which Iâve been putting off since 1997. Upon arrival at the Hall of Justice, one must pass through a metal detector and submit all handbags for inspection. Iâve done this many times before, and needless to say, thereâs never been a problem. Standing in line surrounded by criminals, I am suddenly singled out and the contents of my bag were emptied on a desk for all to examine.

I grab my bag, pills, and earrings, shoot a dirty look to the security guard, and make my way to Jury Room 307.

The Jury Room is empty, so I pick a middle table and proceed to fill out said form. Suddenly, a huge Samoan pulls out a chair and sits right next to me. In a room filled with at least 30 tables and hundreds of chairs, we sit alone and pretend to ignore each other. Our proximity to each other began to make me uncomfortable, so I decided to speak.  âJury Duty is complete bullshit.â (Itâs all I could come up with.) Tiny continues writing and ignoring me. I try again. âI mean, I wouldnât want me on my jury. Iâm clearly an idiot. And I have the attention span of a toddler.â Still, nothing.  I shut up, finish my form, and turn it in. Tiny is still furiously scrawling away at his form. I turn to leave the Jury Room and he yells after me, âIâll see you later.â What? I donât recall making plans. Now, Iâm home, with the door dead bolted and the alarm on. I was at the Hall of Justice for about 20 minutes, and Iâve returned feeling violated and stalked. I believe this is why people live in the suburbsâ¦",female,26,Arts,Aquarius,1
481590,3751913,2004-07-13,"Blow Out is my new favorite show. It's a reality show on Bravo about this salon and all of the drama and hijinks that go on there. It's run by this huge queen named Jonathan. If you haven't seen it, watch it. It's fabulous. However, I appear to be the only one around that is positive he's entirely gay. I assumed he was out and proud until I watched that episode which has him waking up in bed with some supermodel passed out in bed next to him. Hi, overcompensation. I was shocked to see this, and expressed this shock to Bonnie.  ""What are you talking about?"" she replied. ""He's so straight."" Are you fucking blind and deaf? Days later, I'm chatting on the phone with Jason.  ""You know what my new show is?"" he asks. ""Blow Out."" ""I know, I know."" I say. ""Isn't Jonathan totally gay."" ""What are you talking about?"" he says. ""He's not gay."" Hello, people. He's a stylist in Seven jeans, with a faux tan, and constant drama. He throws temper tantrums and once screamed at someone on the phone and then tossed his designer cell into a dumpster for dramatic effect. He's a total nelly queen. Gay, gay, gay. I'm an expert on very few things, but this is one of them. My God, he makes Carson Kressley look like John Wayne.",female,26,Arts,Aquarius,1
481591,3751913,2004-07-12,"Last night, I had a very intense and realistic dream involving myself and San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom, who, as we all know, is a stone cold fox. In said dream, we were highly romantically involved AND he wrote me a letter of recommendation for some job I wanted. It was fabulous. I just woke up and couldn't figure out why I'm in such a good mood, especially considering I'm on my way to Jury Duty. But here I am, skipping around, making coffee, and I suddenly realized, I'm not actually having an affair with Gavin. My sub-conscious is fucking with me and toying with my emotions. But, damn, that was one hell of a dream. It was so realistic, I recall walking around HIS apartment in HIS bathrobe. Hello? How marvelous is that... I'm going to go try and go back to sleep. Here I come, Gavy!",female,26,Arts,Aquarius,1
481592,3751913,2004-07-12,"When I was younger, I always knew I was the weird girl. I would make every effort to reign in my bizarreness, but without fail, I'd always end up lying in bed thinking, ""Golly. I really am pretty weird, and I'm confident I'm not the only one that thinks so."" I'd go to Christmas parties or Basketball Banquets, and ahead of time, prep myself.  Okay, Beth. Stay in the background, blend in, don't try and talk.   But lo and behold, I'd return from said party having done it again. My need to orchestrate large scale theatrical numbers and stage contests always took over. At the time, I'd be positive that explaining my need to wrap tablecloths around my party dress made me fashion forward and cosmopolitan. Somehow, creating complex trivia games or reenacting New Kids on the Block videos entirely solo never got the reactions I expected. I noticed that other kids were loud and opinionated as well, but never quite as strange as myself. I mean, I'm pretty sure I was the only one that tried to start a club called the Ovary Brigade in the bathroom of the Olympic Club during the Father Daughter Dance, crowning myself Queen of the Fallopian Tubes. But, I felt certain that as time passed, my sensibilities would morph into normalcy and I'd grow into a socially acceptable personality.  Not so much.  A few months ago, I broke the dryer. 26 years old and home alone at 10am, with the dryer door open and clothes lying all over the place, I dressed up as Beyonce, fully accessorized and made up, and performed an intense, pre-choreographed routine to ""Crazy in Love"" that resulted in my falling off a chair and landing on the open dryer door, essentially breaking it off the dryer. What's worse, I completed the song, before calling Bonnie and explained why we couldn't use the dryer. At work, whenever I'd request Ben play me some Beyonce, he'd reply, ""Nope. You might break the copy machine.""  It's now July, and I'm sitting here listening to Christmas music, working on a painting inspired by an episode of ALF I watched last night, and about to crank call Andy and leave him bizarre messages.  I think I get it, now. I'm weird. Strange. Curious, even. I prefer the term eccentric. I'm stuck this way, with nothing to do but embrace it. But, really, I still do lie in bed at night and think to myself, ""Yep. I'm still the weird girl. I've got to work on that.""  But I won't. Because, in reality, being the weird girl means that the pussies are easily scared off and those that stay around tend to be far more interesting and willing to play Celebrity Password at a moment's notice. And really, those are the kind of people a weird girl needs in her life.  So, thanks gang, thanks.",female,26,Arts,Aquarius,1

Recently, Iâve become obsessed with the fact that Gerald McRaney, TVâs âMajor Dadâ, plays a general. This guy is always military. Heâs completely typecast, save when he appeared on Designing Women as Delta Burkeâs ex-husband. And isnât it interesting, that of the two of them, heâs still working. And sheâs hocking washable silk to fat poor women.  None the less, Gerald McRaney has made a career of playing the âby the booksâ major, lieutenant, colonel, whatever. Heâs the go-to guy for your âuptight, but is really a nice guyâ military type.   We need a blue collar 4 star general with a heart of goldâ¦is Major Dad available? Yep, he is.

481594,3751913,2004-07-10,"Today, my friend Jason and I went shopping in Union Square. Jason, being the straight that he is, canât pick out his own clothes, and as I am happy to shop 24/7, we often peruse the current designer lines together. Our favorite place to check out menswear is The Saks Fifth Avenue Menâs Store, Fifth Floor Designer Sportswear. The fifth floor is where all the Prada, Gucci, Yamamoto, etc. is. Itâs also where Ryan is. Ryan looks like a 12 year old Cambodian boy dressed by Donnatella Versace. Heâs kind of whiny and impish, and he takes couture very seriously. Jason and I find him a great source of interest and ridicule and often make a point of interacting with him. In fact, we refer to shopping as âvisiting Ryan.â Today, Ryan and I had a pow-wow regarding my sequined flip flops. Ryan loves them. Heâs going to buy several pairs of them for his âguestsâ to use at his apartment. Can you imagine going to visit your little friend Ryan, the designer retail diva, and discover upon your arrival at his fabulously appointed flat that youâve been offered sequined flip flops for your comfort. I fucking love this guy.  Heâs so beautifully and ironically out of touch with fashion, he confused my Old Navy jacket and skirt for Prada and Theory, and was shocked to learn that the cost of my entire look was about $30. I decided to find it charming instead of sad, as we love our Ryan so, but I must admit Iâm a little disappointed heâs got such a shitty eye. I think my neighbor, Big Juan, probably knows the difference between Old Navy and Prada. Why doesnât Ryan? I want to know everything about Ryan. Whereâs he from? Who does he date? How does he afford all this designer shit? I think Jason and I should take him out and befriend him. I want Ryan at my parties, telling me how âdivineâ my accessories are and sipping his mojito. He adds such flavor and entertainment value to our shopping, one can only imagine the pizzazz he brings to oneâs personal life.  So, dear Ryan, if youâre reading this, the girl in the sequined flops and the guy with the natural highlights adore you.  Find us, and make our lives extraordinary.",female,26,Arts,Aquarius,1
481595,3751913,2004-07-09,"Dear John Cusack, 						 You make me re-fall in love with you every time you speak. You make me love Chicago. You make me expect more from men. I would follow your trench tails to the ends of the earth. I would save any phone message you left me for the entirety of my life. I would totally get along with your sister.  Lloyd Dobbler changed the way I looked at the opposite sex. And really, that role in Say Anything is the greatest manifestation of your fabulousness. The best thing about Lloyd was his consistency. Lloyd was not about bullshit. He committed to Diane. He possessed focus. He wasnât like some of the jackasses I have come to know, who seem like Lloyd at the beginning, but then turn into neglectful, cranky, disinterested jerks.  Moving on, so few can pull off sweet and cool and innocent and street-smart and vulnerable all at the same time. Lloyd had a deep simplicity, if thatâs possible. And let me tell you, it is intoxicating. But most importantly of all, John, you were the star of the most profound romantic moment in film history. Iâm speaking, of course, of the âIn Your Eyesâ boom box scene. Each time I see it, I am overwhelmed in new and intense ways. In addition to the brilliance captured in the final cut of Say Anything, deleted scenes on the DVD reveal an even more personal and moving performance in that moment. Thank you.  To be honest, I secretly first fell for you in The Journey of Natty Gann (1985), but I could never admit, even at 7, that I loved that retarded movie. God, how I loved you in that. You were so wonderfully protective and resourceful, like a slightly hipper, younger, more brooding MacGuyver. You seemed so fun to be around in Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil. I just wanted to explore bizarre Southern cities with you and crash debutante balls and plantation weddings. Conveniently enough, I get along famously with drag queens as well. However, in Being John Malkovitch, all I desperately wanted was to have your hair professionally styled. I hated your hair in that movie. Never do that to me again.  High Fidelity was heaven and hell for me. Rob did not posses Lloydâs devotion. And it is the devotion that I so adore. Rob found so many faults with every woman he encountered. It made me self conscious, and I like to think that you would love me as I am, forever and ever and ever. But Rob was super cool, and who doesnât love a Top 5 list. I should make a Top 5 list of all the things I love about you. Top 5? Ha! Try Top 5 Million.  John, even in all too brief celluloid moments, like your moving turn as the dead older brother in Stand By Me, you were remarkable and memorable.  Your talent overwhelms me. Your constant black trench coat excites me. But most of all, your sophisticated wit and charming essence define my being. And even though, you feel the need to occasionally assault my soul, (Anastasia, Serendipity, etc.) I know you truly are the greatest living man on our fine planet.  Contact me immediately.  Warmest Regards,  Beth Spotswood",female,26,Arts,Aquarius,1

481597,3751913,2004-07-08,"Zoe and I were both bored out of our minds last night, and as it was a rare occasion that Zoe didn't have to slave over the cursed costumes at Beach Blanket, we felt the need to utilize this opportunity and hit the town.  Seated on the floor of Zoe's flat with maps and tour books in front of us, we couldn't agree on where to go. We wanted an experience, you see, and had no desire to patronize our usual haunts. Thus, we spent a solid hour looking up random establishments that struck us as bizarre and experience-worthy. We decided on some place called Sherlock's, on the 30th floor of the Crown Plaza Hotel. Envisioning it as some kind of British, mystery-themed, tourist establishment, we delighted in the prospect of some sort of trivia contest or similar. We found street parking (possibly the most notable event of the evening) and walked to the hotel. The Crown Plaza is a shitty looking hotel, that smells quite similar to a dorm room refridgerator, and the staff there is mildly retaded at best. We hopped an elevator to the 30th floor and emotionally prepared ourselves for the bizarre experience we felt sure we would find.  There is no longer a Sherlock's on the 30th floor of the Crown Plaza Hotel. There is a cheezy mauve banquet room, a dumpster, and a white courtesy phone, but there is no turn of the century themed pub with fireplaces and mystery games. Fuck! Next, we tried Harry Denton's Starlight Room. We rode the elevator with 3 gentlemen of questionable intelligence and entered the club. After being carded twice, we were told there was a $20 cover. Fuck! We walked over to The St. Francis Hotel, as I remembered there being some sort of hoppin' club at the top, and decided we'd rather drop our $20 on top shelf liquor than pay to get our asses grabbed at the Starlight Room. As fate would have it, there was a private party there, and a Janet Reno-esque woman shoved us back on the elevator while drunkedly trying to pick up a petite, poorly dressed businessman. Fuck! Frustrated and curious as to why god insisted we not have an experience, I recalled a bar near the Stockton/Sutter garage that always looked kinda cool. We headed over there, cursing Janet Reno and joking as to what could be wrong with this place. Well, I'll tell you what was wrong with it. It's closed for renovations, with caution tape and everything. Fuck! Finally, ready to give up and down our booze in the comfort of Zoe's living room, we walked one last block and discovered The Irish Bank. Located in an alley off Bush Street, The Irish Bank is a pub straight from the dole lines of Dublin. Filled with drunken Irishmen and hideous women, Zoe and I had finally found our experience. We ordered our wine and cider, like the suburban wenches we are, and decided the benches outside in the alley were preferrable to the long tables of profanity inside.  Within minutes, we were surrounded by Irishmen, all having come from a Giants game and desperate to chat with random American women snobbilly sipping their libations. Michael is an electrician and fascinated by peep shows and strippers. Johnny looks like the villian in Kindergarten Cop, but is lovely and a little quiet. Emyn is gorgeous, polite, and very into the Tour de France. And Rory was the best dressed, and had a very manly handshake which I enjoyed immensly. There were various others, of course, but I didn't catch their names. There Zoe and I sat, surrounded by The Committments and attempting to decipher their drunken brogues. It was really quite marvelous.  After a few drinks and a few inviataions to do god knows what, we took our leave and laughed all the way home, debating which drunkard was the hottest. (We decided on Emyn) I'd say we got our experience, and needless to say, I think you know where we'll be next Wednesday night.",female,26,Arts,Aquarius,1

Andy and I met Katherine and her husband there, and along with 2 other couples I barely knew, we entered the club and ordered drinks.  I often bitch about being single. I moan and complain and curse the gods. I wonder aloud how someone so charming and occasionally attractive could be so universally rejected. And I can't fathom why the only men who find me breathtaking are the elderly or incarcerated. Last night, I thanked my lucky stars. We sat there, the 8 of us, and heard 5 or 6 comedians of various talent levels perform. Some were grand, some sucked ass. Regardless, I was really watching the 3 couples at my table. And I was bored. They sat, with their hands in their laps, laughing when appropriate and sipping their non-alcoholic beverages. By their apparel, I could tell they no longer cared how they looked to each other. Physical contact was obligitory, and everything was ""us"" or ""we.""  ""We don't like bananas."" ""We'll have diet cokes."" ""We're going to the bathroom."" Jesus Christ. I was ready to kill myself. The kicker, and this is entirely my snobbery and judgement, was when one couple ordered hot chocolate with whipped cream and sprinkles. We're at a bar, people, with commedians on stage   who will readilly mock that beverage. Grow some balls and get a fucking beer, little girl. They might as welll have ordered Shirley Temples.

481599,3751913,2004-07-03,"Yesterday, fate and possibly karma required that I take care of some business with the fine folks at the Department of Motor Vehicles. I opted to go to the Marin DMV because my car is registered in Marin and the lines are significantly shorter than the Ellis Island-esque San Francisco DMV. One would imagine that the Marin DMV line, short as it is, would be filled with the likes of trophy wives in tennis skirts and illegal immigrants. Turns out, not so much.  In front of me was a butch lesbian, in menâs clothing, with her keys attached to her belt loops and a necklace made out of wild animal teeth. Behind me was a young, black mother of three, with a gold tooth marked with $. Her youngest child, appearing no older than three had a diamond earring and a huge diamond encrusted medallion. All three children roamed wildly about the room, knocking over sign stands and accusing each other of âfronting.â When you arrive at the Marin DMV, there appears to be some sort of concierge at the front door, screaming âHello!!!â in her puffy paint sweatshirt with squirrels on it. I approached her desk, and noticed in small cursive at the bottom of her squirrel image, the appalling, âBranson, Missouri.â She inquired as to my DMV needs, and promptly sent me to the end of the line. She did this with everyone. I began to realize, as I watched her and waited in line, sheâs simply some sort of very nosy woman whoâs fascinated by the various reasons anyone would spend a glorious Friday afternoon in the bureaucratic hell that is The Department of Motor Vehicles. She is not employed by the state, and those that are find it too effortful to remove her.  Actual DMV employees remind me of a propaganda documentary I saw as a child, depicting Russian Communist workers as slackers with no sense of urgency, work ethic, or customer service. Those of us in line stare down the people at each window, desperate to predict which one will be done first. I smile at the fast people, people who understand that the most important thing is to get out with as much efficiency and speed as possible. I smile at the employees who appear to know what theyâre doing, hoping my turn falls on one of them. And I glare at those that look upon their time at the window as a personal government class, asking every stupid question under the sun and then proceeding to be ill-prepared.  One man at the window left his insurance card in his car. âThatâs okay,â said the wench behind the window, âIâll wait.â Are you shitting me? You snooze, you loose, pal. I came prepared and I should be rewarded for doing so.  Finally, my turn came. I hiked over to Window 17, where âLodovicoâ informed me I had a little unpaid parking ticket issue. No shit, Lodovico. Mind your business and give me my fucking tags. Iâve been in line over there in Calcutta and Iâm ready to go home.  Finally free, and in possession of the fucking sticker âthe manâ requires I suffer for, I break free into the sunshine as affix the yellow tag to Rhonda the Honda, or as sheâs become known of late, The Silver Bullet. With the knowledge that, at least for the next 30 days, Iâm finally legally allowed to drive my car, I cut across the double lines and speed past the Corte Madera police station. Fuck you, coppers!

481603,3751913,2004-08-16,"But before I get to that...a day of travel: We awoke at 5:30am and were greeted in the lobby by our old pal, Mr. Yen. He drove us to the Guilin Airport where we literally walked right onto the plane and found our seats. Unfortunately, we were surrounded by 50 pushy German tourists who kept dropping their huge carry-ons on Alex's head. I shot them dirty looks and kept mumbling something about the gestapo under my breath. After a 45 minute flight on South China Airlines to Guangzhou (formerly Canton), we landed and attempted to disembark. The Germans, however, had some extreme need to get off the plane before the doors were even opened, prompting a loud and annoyed, ""You need to chill out."" from me. At the luggage terminal, there was no sign of a guide to take us to the train station, so I was sent to the greeting area and was promised my bag would be located and taken care of. Wandering around the airport looking for someone holding a sign saying anything resembling ""Spotswood"", I mistook 3 people for our guide before finally finding him. A middle-aged Chinese guy that spoke great English, he introduced himself as ""Kelly"" and informed me that the drive to the train station would take 45 minutes, and the high speed train ride to Hong Kong another hour and 50 minutes. Fine. I'm normally not even awake yet, so what do I care. The family found the bags, including mine, and headed over to meet us. Mom kept calling him ""Kenny"", but otherwise, it was pretty easy getting to the train station, all the way across Guangzhou, aparently the biggest city in Southeast China. The train station resembled Calcutta during a Ghandi speech, and we were forced to fight our way past the chickens, goats, and legless beggars to the ticket counter. Informed that they only took cash, and my father now famous for being consistently cash free, we ran Amazing Race style to an ATM, and with much help from me, dad was able to aquire some scratch. As Hong Kong is considered foreign still, with different money and English as the official language, we had to go through customs and get a SARS test, which consisted of lasers in our eyes and some machine that magically took our temperature. With minutes to spare, we made our train and had a lovely ride to Hong Kong. We spent our last yuen on a gross train-prepared lunch and dad seemed to worry the entire time about getting some HK dollars at the train station. Ya know, I bet they have ATM's there too. They did indeed, and as soon as we went through customs again, and more SARS laser tests, we found said ATM and a taxi line. I cannot express to you the level of BO I encountered in that taxi line, but I think it's fair to say it was substantial. So having traveled by van, plane, train, and taxi, all in one morning, we pulled up to the world famous Penninsula Hotel in Hong Kong and here I am. As we entered the lobby, a string quartet played ""Yesterday"" from a balcony overhead. I looked up and smiled at them. They looked down and smiled at me. I was tempted to request ""I think I'm Gonna Like it Here"" from Annie, but thought I should probably play it cool. Shops in the lobby include Manolo Blahnik, Tiffany and Co., and the ever-present Armani. Out bathroom has a flat-screen TV with DVD player built into the marble wall, and the robes are plusher than anything I've ever felt in my life. Our 23rd floor room has a view of metro Hong Kong, and a Philipe Stark designed retaurant and bar on the top floor is open till 2am. On my way down to the Business Center, where I have my own office, mind you, I chatted with the bell boy about where the hip and happening party here. Now, I've got the scoop and plan to hobknob with the jetsetters upstairs once the folks hit the hay. We're here for four nights, leaving bright and early Sunday moring. And no, dear Andy, I return on the 22nd, not the 23rd. In fact, we leave HK at 11am Sunday moring and arrive in SFO at 9am. This is one crazy planet. I must say, after an exhausting day of travel and new and unexpected smells, it's all been worth it. I shall now retire to my room, steam my gown, and plan my next three days. I have one fantasy in Hong Kong, and the family has agreed to it. I want to spend one evening alone, drinking alone and dining alone. I have this fantasy of myself as the mysterious, American woman travelling alone at the Penninsula Hotel, dressed fabulously, reading a book at a table alone. I want everyone to wonder who I am and what I'm doing here, and I don't want to talk to anyone I'm related to. The key word is alone. Alone. Alone. Alone. You people have 3 days of freedom left. Send your last minute requests for Chinese curios and I'll do my damdest. And now, to tea...",female,26,Arts,Aquarius,1
481604,3751913,2004-08-16,"I should be curled up in bed asleep, as I have to be on a plane in hours, however the events of the past few hours are too bizarre and I'm terrified I'll forget them. Tonight, Mr. Yen picked us up and took us to some hotel, where we were to have dinner and a cultural show. We were ushered into a huge atrium auditorium, where only 2 other people sat, both Americans. A stage, with a large digital screen above it, was at the center, and hundereds of empty tables and chairs surrounded it. We were then presented with a fixed menu, and discovered our meal would consist of prawn salad, minestrone, steak and a baked potato, banana pancakes, fruit, and coffee. We were also allowed one cocktail each. Dad and Alex chose beer, as mom opted for her traditional Chardonnay, and I ordered Evian, which was apparently extra, but I'm taking no chances with this water. We also ordered a bottle of our now standard wine, Great Wall, and all agreed that this would be incredibly wierd if there were only 6 people in the audience. Dad, carrying only cash as he's now terrified of pickpockets, asked if anyone else brought money. No, why would we. Dinner arrived, but no other guests. At this point, mom and I got the giggles. Dad pointed out that he felt perfectly fine, and wouldn't care if he were the only one in the audience. The trick was to clap fast, as it would seem there were hundereds of us. Finally, just as the show was about to start, maybe 10 more people joined us in this huge theater, although they didn't eat. Wise of them, but live and learn. Mom expressed concern that the stairs leading up to the stage inplied audience participation, but I pointed out this was traditional, minority Chinese dance. How could they integrate us? The show began, with a woman dressed in sparkly Tibetian attire, and in broken English, welcomed us. Above her, on the digital screen, scrolled her lines, just in case we couldn't understand her. This continued throughout the performance, with every 10th word misspelled. The cast consisted of 10 tiny Asian gals and 4 Asian queens, who took their roles far more seriously than their female counterparts. Dressed initially in a combination of Martian and peasant, I was instantly enthralled. The dances, which could have been choreographed by Paula Abdul's less talented assistant, was hilarious, as were the ever changing, over the top costumes. It looked like a Saturday Night Live sketch, although we weren't supposed to laugh. I could do nothing but wish my friends were there to witness this event, as words don't exist to adequetly describe it. In every country, under any circumstance, if someone is going to get pulled onstage, it's going to be Alex Spotswood. Starting at age 10, getting his head chopped off by a magician on a Carribean cruise, Alex always seems to find himself hand in hand with some scantilly clad hussy getting dragged into the spotlight. He's a big, tall pretty boy who's always a good sport. God bless him, tonight was no different. Twice, I repeat, twice, the boy dived in and performed, beautifully, I might add. In hysterics, I snapped away at my disposable as he made faces at us from the stage. With about 15 people in the entire audience, he felt perfectly comfortable hamming it up. As he descended the stage, I shouted, ""Fabulous! Encore!"" at the top of my lungs. The show lasted far too long and had about as much to do with traditional Chinese minority culture as the Starbucks on every corner. As it was finally time to go, and meet Mr. Yen in the lobby, the bill arrived. Dad looked it over, and then looked up in horror. ""I don't have enough money."" My mother, finding this the most hilarious thing ever to occur, couldn't speak she was laughing so hard. It was agreed that Alex go run and get 10 yuen from Mr. Yen. ""Mr. Yen, I apologize, really. God, I'm so sorry. We're 10 yuen short."" He returns with the 10 yuen ($1.30 US) only to find we're 20 yuen short. Again, he runs into the lobby to find Mr. Yen. With the bill finally paid with borrowed money, we agree to get the hell out of there. Laughing so hard we can barely stand, we agree that begging this poor, old Chinese guy for 3 bucks is far better than washing dishes in the back, even if there were only six of them. I cannot belive that a) we agreed to go to such a bizarre showcase of Chinese bad taste, and b) that my father, who drives a car that costs more than a condo in Guilin, was 3 bucks short on our bill. Oh. My. God.",female,26,Arts,Aquarius,1
481605,3751913,2004-08-16,"China seems to have selective communism, although that that is communism is pretty out there. Mom's fascinated by the whole ""one-child rule"" and asks about it often. Apparently, if you're pregnant with your second child and can't afford to bribe the government, soldiers will come in the dead of night and forcibly take you to have an abortion. The government regulates ALL newspapers, as news should inspire and encourage the people. Oh, in America, we like our news to inform the people. All judges and juries are for show, while a government central committee really decides the fates of criminals, with firing squad death penalty given to murderers, drug dealers, and bank robbers. Guilin, the town I'n in now, has a population of 500,000 and an average of 33 criminals are put to death here every year. I spent a month selling cheap joints in college. Had I done so here, I'd be tied to a pole and exectued. The thing about being in some tiny fishing town in the middle of nowhere, with my baggage at it's maximum, means I can't shop and explore what interests me and get massages. I'm actually forced to learn about the country I'm in. Apparently, this is why most people travel in the first place. Turns out, it's kinda interesting. I don't really want to pontificate in some pseudo-intellectual diatribe about why China is so backwards and our way of doing things is much better, but quite frankly, it is. Communism has never worked, even selective communism as they have here, and I can see why. Sure, there's free enterprise, but it's found through bribery and exploitation of the poor and uneduated. The fact of the matter is, no one is truly free to say what they want or live how they please. Women lack all power, and while most work, they earn far less than their male counterparts. True in America as well, obviously, but the gap is dramatically wider here. It's shocking and sad, particularly as America and China do so much business. Why can't we smoke Cuban cigars but purchase Coke produced here? It doesn't make sense, and while I have no idea what it's like to live in Cuba, it can't be any worse than China. And now, for my judgemental commentary on the past 24 hours...Last night, we passed up the ""Forest Gump Restaurant"" and hit some joint that had both Western and Eastern food, pleasing everyone. Alex and I headed back to the hotel to watch Olympic weightlifting, while mom and dad walked around and shopped. We awoke this moring to meet Mr. Yen in the lobby to head off to our Li River Cruise. Occasionally, Mr. Yen's cell rings, and mom and I can't seem to stiffle giigles as he's chosen ""We Wish You a Merry Christmas"" as his ringtone. At the docks, we're hustled onto one of several huge, old, ferry-type boats, the Westerners being separated from the Chinese tourists. Apparently, the Chinese tourists pay half-price. We were on a boat with a bunch of Italians, who sucked down Marlboro's like there was no tomorrow. The boat ride was pretty spectacular, and Mr. Yen hid himself well. Occasionally, he'd show up to point out to strangely shaped hill, and we'd all pretend to see the lion or steamboat or pumpkin he'd point out. A few hours into the ride, we had a buffet lunch of disgusting Chinese food and french fries. I knew the food was inedible, as we could see it being prepared on the other tourist boats that flanked us. The kitchens, you see, were open decks at the back of each boat. A fishing raft would pull up and hand over live fish, which the ""chef"" would then grab and bang against the floor of the ferry until the fish was nearly dead. I decided to pass on most of the buffet, especially considering my recent bout with parasitic SARS. The boats docked in the early afternoon in Yangshou, an even tinier fishing villiage packed with hikers and climbers, here for the mountaineering. It truly looked like Southeast Asia, which is essentially, where we are. I bought a communist t-shirt and drinkable water. After wandering around Yangshou, we drove the hour back to the hotel quizzing Mr. Yen on all things Chinese. ""We make-uh much lice here."" ""Oh yes."" says dad. ""We make rice in California too."" A pause. ""But not as much as you make here."" Mom lost it. No shit dad. This is China. My father is famous for stating or asking the bizarre, in the interest of appearing informed or interested. His last famous quote occured 3 years ago, while on safari in South Africa. In the middle of the bush, guided by Jerome, the Matt Damon-esque safari guide I'm still waiting for to come and whisk me away, we stop to observe hippos in a small pool of water. ""Now Jerome,"" says dad, ""What's the difference between Rhinoceros' and Hippopotomous'?"" About the same as cats and dogs, dad. Finally back at the hotel, we're being taken to some Chinese minority dance show this evening. Tomorrow, we leave at the break of dawn, literally, on a plane for Canton, where we then take a train to Hong Kong. Thus, I should be in Hong Kong by tomorrow afternoon, on a real computer which might be able to post these blogs. Hong Kong is still considered a foreign country by the Chinese and thus, we must spend our remaining yuen before tomorrow afternoon. Considering I have about 25 yuen left ($3), I don't think that'll be a problem.",female,26,Arts,Aquarius,1
481606,3751913,2004-08-16,"Last night was our final night in Beijing. To celebrate, I decided to have a solo drink in the lobby bar. To know me is to know I love hotel bars, and I find nothing more pleasant than sitting in an upscale one, drinking my Cabernet and silently observing those around me. I chose a table towards the middle and ordered something French sounding. I then proceeded to pretend to read my book while taking inventory. I was instantly delighted to notice I was the only young woman sitting alone and there were 3, yep three, hot, young guys sitting alone at different tables. I made the requisite eye contact with each of them and then began to fantasize about all of the fabulous reasons they would each be in Beijing. The one sitting closest to me was obviously American, reading a Nick Hornby novel and drinking beer. Another was a stunning black guy dressed in Paul Smith and drinking something girly. I made a note that we had a possible homo. The 3rd appeared a little too backpacky for me, but what the fuck. I'm in Beijing. Beggars can't be choosers. I did the occasional look up from the book and smile, although the only one staring back and smiling was the hot black dude. Homo confirmation. A group of 20 year old Brazillian soccer players were sitting at the bar, and had finished their drinks and left. A few of them stood yards away, by a huge floral arrangement, and I noticed them looking at me and giggling. Suddenly, out of the corner of my eye, I saw two approaching me. ""Excuse me."" they both appeared terrified. I looked up and smiled. ""Hi."" ""Yes"" said the obvious leader, ""Can my friend have one of these?"" He pointed to a Pingle sitting in the silver dish before me. (The Chinese are obsessed with Pringles. Even at the fanciest of bars, I'm always presented with them. Mom says it's because they travel so well.) ""Of course. You may have them all!"" He nervously grabbed a single Pringle and they both ran off, high fiving their compatriots and turning around shooting me huge smiles. I laughed, at which point the Nick Hornby guy looked up and laughed to. A ha! My chance. I considered sending over a note and a drink, and as soon as I mustered the courage, who shows up but my brother. Hornby shoved his head back in the novel and that was the end of that. Foiled! We went to dinner at a terribly fancy place called Aria, where I spent the evening dodging the stares from a hideous businessman at the next table, resembling a less atractive Mr. Kotter. Dinner, however was fabulous, and I had an incredible foir gras with tomato chutney that blew my mind. Today, we left at the break of dawn and arrived in Guilin after a 3 hour flight on Hainan Airlines. No, I've never heard of it either. Guilin is a tiny fishing villiage, about 200 miles from Vietnam. This makes sense, as it looks exactly like Vietnam does, at least in the movies. We were greeted by our guide, Mr. Yen. Hardly a 20-something Asian beauty queen, Alex descibed Mr. Yen as resembling the evil villian in a James Bond movie. ""A-welcome to-a Guilin. Me take-a you to hotel and den we see da caves of magic and you very long flight. You rook at lice patties."" Oh dear. Oh dear indeed. As our rooms weren't ready yet, Mr. Yen took us directly to the aforementioned caves, which resembled the Small World ride at Disneyland. The caves, once an amazing example of nature's artistyry, had been turned into a colored lights show by the Chinese government. We immediately insisted on going back to the hotel and relaxing, as tomorrow is a 7 hour boat ride down the Li River and then a dinner and cultural performance designed to make tourists think China's got their shit together. The thing is, they don't. Not around here, at least. Mr. Yen kept pointing out all these empty buildings, apparently once lived in by locals but then kicked out by the government in order to develop the property into money-making businesses. Problematically, they can't develop anything. No one wants to rent. So they remain empty, and the people that were once perfectly happy living there are given a thrid of the value of their property and sent ot the country. Nice. Guilin is tiny compared to Shanghai and Beijing, and about 20 years behind both. We've been warned sevral times about thieves and robbers, and I'm now, of course, terribly paranoid. More importantly, however, I have to run as my dad and Alex are a half an hour ahead of me at the 2 for 1 drink special at the bar. And they do have, oddly enough, a killer Sangria.",female,26,Arts,Aquarius,1

481608,3751913,2004-08-15,"Oh, what a difference a day makes. The dreaded tapeworm, parasite, or small Asian that entered my system seems to have left, and after 13 hours sleep, I'm a new woman. As I return home in a mere 7 days, I have much to do and much to buy. Today, I made up for lost time. After breakfast, which I was delightedly able to keep down, we hit the Silk Market. There is no silk at the Silk Market, but there is fake silk, and fake everything else. As told by Jason the flight attendant, this is the place to buy North Face. So I did. Alex picked up some Lacoste and Adidas, and I must say, is quite good at bargaining. The student, it seems, has become the master. We ran into another family, much like ours, and both moms comisserated at how their sons love to haggle. Often on these trips, I spot families just like ours. They're always from a coast, the dad is always carrying a International Herald Tribune, the mom has expensive walking shoes, tons of maps and travel books, and a good, non-designer bag, and the kids give us knowing looks. Many of my friends find it bizarre that my family takes a big trip together every year, but we're not alone. I remember at 17, we went on a European cruise up to Russia and through Northern Europe, and I met MacKenzie, a 20 year old from Greenwich, CT travelling with his family and 16 year old sister. ""Ah"", he said when he saw me, ""Travelling with the family on a non-optional world tour? Let me charge you a drink."" We spent an all nighter in the bar, trading war stories of the bathrooms at the Louvre and pickpockets in Rome. That night, he taught me how to order champagne as we toasted our travels. When we left ship, he found me and said, ""Hey Beth. Maybe I'll see you at the piramids, next time."" One can only dream. After shopping at the knock-off extravaganze, we hit the Ghost Market. Possibly the most famous market in China, this was unlike anything I've ever heard of. Covered stalls filled with painted human skulls, revolutionary memoribillia, Tibetian jewelry, caligraphy brushes, and tons of old anitiques were packed with locals and tourists alike. I found a little shop along the side selling amazing black and white photography. In a bin in the corner was a pile of old, rejected photos. I pulled up a stool and spent 30 minutes shuffling through them, pulling the ones I liked. My uncle Ted, a frequent commenter here on the blog, is a photographer who would have died upon entry into this place. It became inperative that I find him something. For mere pennies, I walked away with a handful of old photos and the undying love of the girl running the shop. Amidst the stalls, I found incredible, old jewelry and accessories. I bought some silver and jade earrings for Mercedes and tried to talk dad into buying me a vintage cello. No luck, although he promised to buy me a silk lamp in Hong Kong if I carried it on the plane. Gladly. This was his way of getting out of buying me a real Cartier watch, as my fake one tragically passed away. To his dismay, there's actually a Cartier boutique in our lobby, and I found it a sign that I was meant to have one. Apparently not. Mom and dad headed off to explore some palace and architectural feat of genius, as Alex and opted to cab it back to the hotel and order room service burgers. Ah, civilization. Tonight, we're off to some fancy French joint, and bright and early tomorrow, we leave for Guilin. I have no idea about this Guilin place, but we're only there for two days to see the Li River and some random caves, and then it's off to Hong Kong. I can't wait to get to HK, as I consider it an international mecca. All things cool are in Hong Kong, as well as more knock-off markets. And I can stock up there, as our flight home has no baggage weight limitations. Although, all you boys that have requested Rolex's, keep in mind my prinstinely maintained Cartier lasted a week. I make no promises that your watches will survive the flight. I shall do my best, however. Though should I get arrested at customs, you'll have to bail me out. I'm off to check out the pool, hoping to spot my Japanese rock star friend and make actual contact. He sat near us at breakfast this moring, listening to an MP3 player and bobbing his head like he actually understood the gangsta rap I'm positive he was listening to. Oh, you crazy foreigners. I've become an expert at hotel gossip, and have befriended many employees in my need to be nosy. Being so far away from home, I have no idea what's going on with my friends. I'm desperate for info and must resort to spying on Australian tourists and Japanese rockstars. It's midnight on Saturday in San Francisco. I know you guys are out partying without me and it's driving me nuts. If there's anything I hate more than food-poisoning, it's being out of the loop. Send me e-mail gossip immediately. As an aside, my brilliant and gifted friend Jesse just updated her website. Check it out and buy everything.  urlLink www.thejessebcollection.com  Props to her and Zoe for sending me updates and headlines. I'm assuming I can update from Guilin, but as no one's ever heard of this place, who knows. We shall soon see.",female,26,Arts,Aquarius,1
481609,3751913,2004-08-14,"And I'm not talking about that wimpy, Westernized, once I had old salad dressing food poisoning. I'm talking the Third World, SARS based, internal organs imploding, wish you were dead kind. After dinner, at a seemingly safe restaurant last night, I decided to forgo a romp through town with my family and hit the hay. After all, we were hiking The Great Wall the next day and I wanted to be well-rested. At 1am, I shot out of bed. Pain emminated though my entire body and I immediately got violently ill. Violently. I can not express to you the ammount of pain I was in last night. I can only imagine what it's like to give birth, and this was significantly worse. By 3am, I was convinced it was a tapeworm or something equally gross and tropical. By 3:30, I was ready to call an ambulance. By 4, I had to wake Alex up, really just because I was beginning to think something was seriously, seriously wrong and I needed a second opinion. After watching me writhe in pain for a half hour, he went over to mom and dad's and explained the situation. Mother, who, as I've said many times before, isn't really the mothering type, found me curled up in the fetal position crying hysterically. She crawled in bed with me, sent Alex to sleep in her room, and literally rubbed my back until 7:30, when it became clear I had to make a descision about how I was going to spend the day. As I could barely stand, getting dressed proved complicated, but I made my way down to the dining room. 3 bites of yogurt and I immediately ran for the bathroom and lost it all. Back at the table, and in so much pain I found it hard to not scream, I ran out into the lobby sobbing and cluthing my stomach. Standing alone in a corridor, close to death, I couldn't believe my luck. Today, of all days, when I'm supposed to knock off my 3rd wonder of the world, I get sick. And my family was trapped, as they were terrified to leave me alone, yet really fucking wanted to see The Great Wall in China. Another wave of pain shot through my stomach as I collapsed onto the marble floor in tears. I looked up to find the Japanese rock star standing over me, silently staring. Upstairs, I found mom and admitted I might need to see a doctor. In goddamn Beijing. This terrified all of us, and mom decided to go talk to our guide, Annie, patiently waiting for us in the lobby. It was agreed that Annie, dad, and Alex would go find some kind of medicine and mom would stay with me. In the hotel room, I curled up on the bed and screamed into a pillow, half from the pain and half from the frustration. The boys soon returned with a curious concoction that smelled like mint and they instructed me to drink it. I did, and and attempted to lie back down. 30 minutes later, with it made perfectly clear that this was our only opportunity, probably in any of our lives, to see the Great Wall of China, I decided to go. In retrospect, probably not the wisest choice, but one I had to make. I looked up and said, ""Let's just get this goddamn wall over with."" It was agreed. It took an hour to get out into the country, and as we pulled up to a parking lot, I saw no wall. ""Oh no."" says Annie. ""First we learn about jade."" Fabulous. Another attempt at forcing us to buy crap. I was still finding hard to stand upright, must less feign interest in the jade making process, and mom hustled us out of there. Next, were the Ming Dynasty tombs. I'm sure they were very interesting, but I spent that time on a bench with my head in my lap. I ran to the bathroom as another wave of hell consumed by body but found that the toilets were merely holes in the ground with no toilet paper. Dying or not, I couldn't do it. I'm Beth Spotswood. I've never peed in a hole in the ground and it's a record I intend to keep. Lunch followed, at some government run place that serves you food as rapidly as possible, and then you're supposed to shop in their wherehouse of Chinese crap afterward. Our dining table with filled with plates and plates of fabulous food, yet all I could get down was 3 bites of plain rice and some Hot and Sour soup. After lunch, mom piped up, ""Let's go buy you some silk jackets!"" It was so bad, I didn't even want to shop. I went outside and sat in the sun. Finally, around 2, it was time to head over to The Great Wall. I must admit, it's impressive. Packed with tourists, it climbs thousands of miles into the hills and looks exactly like it's supposed to look. I made it 100 yards, sent my family off, and sat in a corner. Hours later, they descended, drenched and ready to collapse. I was finally starting to feel somewhat better, as we piled in the van with Annie and headed back to the hotel. I slept the entire way home, and now can aknowledge I'm about 75% better. My stomach can still be heard across the room, I'm dehydrated and red eyed, and frustrated as all get out, but it appears I'll live. Considering I wasn't so sure about that a few hours ago, I'm delighted. No one can determine where I contracted this dreaded parasite, although theories include that I drank the water you're not supposed to drink or had too many Chinese Pringles. I think I was the jackass that ate a piece of undercooked meat last night, and hopefully, 24 hours and wierd Chinese medicine will cure me of my malady. Tomorrow, thank god, it's shopping around town at will. I must say, when faced with the prospect of death versus having an ambulance pull up to the Penninsula Hotel and cart you off to some delapidated hospital, I pretty much risked death. After all that, I saw The Goddamn Great Wall of China. And like a Mongolian, nearly died on it.",female,26,Arts,Aquarius,1
481610,3751913,2004-08-13,"Both yesterday and today, I passed a shop called, ""That Person is Accustomed to the Clothing."" I wonder if it was the same shop, or if it's like the Chinese Gap. KFC is huge here, and while I barely believe my eyes, they've Asian-ized the Colonel. Literally. That picture of him that's all over KFC looks like the dad in The Joy Luck Club. Today, after breakfast, Annie picked us up for a huge day of touring Beijing. I'm actually starting to like her more, as she's pretty laid back and seems to cling to me. She's 28 and very curious about California. First, we hit the Temple of Heaven, which is where the emperor prayed twice a year to his father, the ruler of Heaven. Mom found this very confusing. ""I thought he was Buddhist? Is he praying to his biological father? I don't understand."" Hello? He's the emperor. Regular religion doesn't really apply here. I mean, he thinks he used to be a fucking dragon. Don't question. Just accept. This is also where they used to sacrafice little six year old boys and girls, calling them golden dragon (boys) and jade pheonix (girls). Cozy. Then, we drove to Tien'amien Square, which was packed with 68 billion people all trying to sell us crap. We could have waited in line for 4 hours to see the actual dead body of Chairman Mao, but thought better it. We walked over the The Forbidden Palace, essentially across the street from the square, and walked the entire length, about 2 miles. The Forbidden Palace is very recognizable, as it's in a milion movies and has that big portrait of Mao at the front gate. It's 650 years old and was only opened to the public in 1928. I found all the concubine stuff the most interesting, as they were sent away to a seperate palace once they turned 40 and were never heard from again. Kind of like a Chinese Menuedo. Everything here is symbolic, from the roof tiles to the inlaid floor. You start to block it out after awhile, as really, who cares. It's all pretty and obviously has some long story. With so many tourists pushing and shoving, I really just wanted to get out of the way and breathe. After lunch, we toured the Summer Palace, where the emperor spent April thru October. It's huge, of course, and has a monstrous lake in the middle. Many, many tourists were fascinated with us and wanted to have their pictures taken with the Americans. I was delighted to oblidge. Annie said they'd never seen a live Barbie doll before. I knew I liked her. Apparently, they see very few Westerners, and we really look American. We're constantly stared at, and have taken to staring back. Many of them point out my long neck, often touching it and then errupting into laughter. Um, get your fucking hands off my neck, Ming Lao. The most interesting part of the Summer Palace was hearing about The Dragon Lady, the Last Emperor's mom. Also known as the Dowager Empress, she was a hardcore bitch who loved to inflict pain and suffering upon those she hated. Her husband, who I'd imagine to be the 2nd to last Emperor, had a favorite concubine, who sang and danced beautifully. The Dragon Lady was, of course, horrible jealous of her and the day after the emperor died, she had the concubine's arms and legs chopped off. The concubine, still alive mind you, was then put on display in a huge glass jar. Annie told us that as a child, her grammar school class got to camp out at the Summer Palace. ""Golly."" I said, ""I'd be afraid of the Dragon Lady's ghost."" ""Oh yes. We sit around and tell all scary stories of Dragon Lady chop up people."" This is the kind of stuff I love. I could just imagine the Dragon Lady, bitter and bitchy, with her 2 favorite eunichs who did her hair (queens), parading around her summer palace chopping people up. That's so much more interesting than hearing about why the roof is yellow and dragon's paws point east. Finally, we hit the Pearl Market, where you can apparently get great deals on really good pearls. I don't want to give anything away, but I'm a fucking awesome roommate. Tomorrow we walk the Great Wall, although hopefully not all 3700 miles. I'm actually pretty excited to see it, just because it's the fucking Great Wall of China, built to keep out the Mongolians. All I know of the Great Wall is really what I've seen on that episode of South Park (Damn you Mongorians!) and that it's the only man made object you can see from space. None the less, it's on Dad's list of 1000 things to see and do before you die. As I'm staying in room 666, it's good I'm knocking a lot off the list.",female,26,Arts,Aquarius,1
481611,3751913,2004-08-12,"Where do these smells come from? Every day, I'm bombarded with an ancient blend of aromas that shock my system and make my eyes water. I can't figure it out. The Chinese have a very different sense of what tastes and smells good or bad. Desserts are uber-sweet and covered in pastel crap. Beef is always hot pink and oddly flavored. Yesterday, I detected hints of lime popscicle flavor in my stir-fry. We took a cab over to Lotus Lane last night. Lotus Lane, recommended by the concierge, is kinda like Epcot Center's China. There's a big lake in the middle, with all kinds of paddle boats you can rent, and then a promenade around the lake packed with super trendy bars and restaurants, where waiters wear Dolce and Gabbana sarongs with sequined tops and faux-hawks. We seemed to find the only legitimate Chinese restaurant, where dad ordered his standard bottle of red and bottle of white. We each picked 2 things off the menu and the table was soon packed with a wide array of unrecognizable food. I wasn't in a drinking mood, still exhausted and nauseous from my day of hell. That however, didn't stop anyone else. There we sat, along Lotus Lane, overlooking a lovely little lake and sparkely lights, and mom, dad, and Alex were getting trashed. Through the eyes of sobriety, I observed my family and came to the following conclusion: The reason I'm nuts is because these people are nuts. My father insisted upon finishing both bottles as a matter of national pride. My brother and mother seemed to have cause-less giggles, particlarly my mother who gets louder and louder with each sip of Chardonnay. Alex, when drunk, apparently spills food all over himself. I practically had to carry the 3 of them to the cabs waiting at the gates of Lotus Lane. I crawled in the front, and packed the AA meeting in the back, where my then father lost it. He literally couldn't breathe, he was laughing so hard. At what, you ask? He saw a Kentucky Fried Chicken tram carrying around Japanese tourits and I said, ""Look. It's the KFC zoo-tram."" I think he peed his pants. And when my dad laughs that hard, he makes no noise. He just turns red, shakes, and slaps himself, which of course, makes everyone else start laughing. At one point, he and Alex started to wrestle. My mother, ever the voice of intellectual observation, looks out the window to the packed streets of Beijing and says, ""If they have that birth control law, why do they keep multiplying like rabbits?"" For all that food, booze, and fun, dinner cost $40 US. They're practically giving it away. (Oh wait. Fight in the Business Center. I must eavesdrop.....Oh dear. A very well-dressed American woman's credit card was denied and she's livid. Fabulous. Speaking of which, there's a Japanese rock star staying on our floor, and he looks like a sketch from Saturday Night Live.) Today, Annie is picking us up and we're exploring the Forbidden City. Now, as I generally love to see places that have been in movies, I'm pretty excited, save the fact that it will take all day and I'll probably be ready to shop by 11am. Also, watching my mother try to converse with someone that speaks relatively good English is upsetting. It's like she thinks their deaf AND retarded. Lots of thumbs-ups and similar. It's hard to watch. I'm off to breakfast. Maybe, I'll sit next to the Japanese rock star and he'll hire me to style his upcoming tour. Although, he's gonna need to lose that Catwoman look.",female,26,Arts,Aquarius,1
481612,3751913,2004-08-11,"We are now in Beijing, at The Penninsula Palace Hotel, and Alex and I are in room 666. Seriously. I'm not kidding. Not only that, but mom and dad are next door, which I generally hate as I'd prefer the annonymity of being on a different floor, but their room isn't even ready yet. At 4 fucking pm. Thus, we're all crammed in room 666 exhausted, cranky, and dreaming of The St. Regis. I had to get out. So I came to The Business Center. At least I know when to separate myself. Everyone is driving me nuts. My mother referred to John Mak-lo-vitch and I was ready to stab her with my complimentary pen. My father, assuming all things are foriegn and different in China, couldn't figure out how to twist the top off a bottle of Evian. Literally. I'm ready to kill these idiots that created me. Yes, yes, I know they're wonderful parents who, as my grandmother puts it, whisk me all over the world. But this is the part of family vacations I dread. I'm 26. Having dinner at my parent's house requires that I bite my tounge every 15 minutes. We're on Day 6 of being stuck with each other, it's hot as a mother-fucker, and the sound of my family's voices is making my ears bleed. I keep listening to my CD player spinning ""Shut up"" by The Black Eyed Peas, just watching their lips move. We took off from Shanghai in a typhoon, and of course, it's pouring rain in Beijing. It was so hot and humid on the fucking 1970's East China Airlines plane that you coulda steamed rice. Annie, our scantilly clad guide here, informed us to have a big breakfast as we're walking everywhere tomorrow, about 7 miles, and we won't get back to the hotel till, like 6. Thus far, our schedule has been doing our own thing in the moring (my thing being shopping) and then returning to the hotel in the early afternoon for spa treatments or similar. 8:30-6 hiking all over town with the broken english bombshell is not what I had in mind.  This is what it's like travelling with me. I'm in such a shitty mood, I'm ready to kill the Mid-western idiot at the compter next to me. My god, who are these people? I get that this is an incredible experience, that I'm seeing things most people never have the opportunity to see. But think of all the places you want to go, then imagine going there with both of your parents. It gets hard. Really hard. And suddenly, your mother says Maklovitch and you're ready to fly home. Fucking Maklovitch. Are you kidding me?  My CD player has become my therapy. I block everyone out with my constant replaying of the same songs. Every trip, I bring a million CD's, but only end up listening to 3 of them, obsessed with hearing the same thing over and over. I can't explain it. This trip, it's the entire Scissor Sisters CD, minus the last song, The Last Emperor Soundtrack, and Gavin DeGraw singing a cover of ""Against All Odds"" which breaks my heart everytime I hear it. The only thing that has the ability to put me in an instant good mood is ""Filthy/Gorgeous"" by The Scissor Sisters, as I've envisioned an entire video starring me, which I performed for Alex last night. It involves me crushing martini glasses with my fabulous Manolo's on the bar at The Redwood Room. I just called Alex up in the room, who informed me that it's safe to come up. The folks have now moved next door, to room 668. As he's saying this, however, I hear in the background, ""Hey Alex, how do you work the lights?""  Ahhhhhhhhhhh!",female,26,Arts,Aquarius,1
481613,3751913,2004-08-11,"Mom lost the digital camera. The one with all the pictures of me dancing with the old man. The one with basically all of Shanghai on it. The one she wouldn't let anyone else carry. Well, it's an excuse to buy a super fancy new one here, and at least it didn't happen at the end of the trip, but it fucking sucks ass. She left it in a cab, of course, and the amazing staff here have made every effort to track down her driver, even reviewing the security footage from the front door, which they found. No one could read the liscence plate, though, and thus, the camera is gone. We'll get over it, and mom's taking it the hardest. Ah well. Yesterday, we hit the insect and fish market. It was bizarre, made up of a serious of intensly smelly alleys. Crickets and bugs and millions of turtles, all within this little residential ghetto. I took a million National Geographic-esque pictures if Chinese children in doorways, and old men asleep on rickshaws, but I'll have to describe them to you. (Okay. Still a little pissed about the camera.) Afterwards, I needed some alone time, so I went off to the fancy mall section of town. An expert shopper in the States, the malls here are pretty similar, and I felt suddenly at home. Many of the stores are the same, and many, many are different. There was a store called 45 Surftime USA, which was the Chinese attempt at Pacific Sunwear. I poked around, and when I told the staff I was from California, they went nuts. ""Oh, Hollywood! Surf and Turf! Hang ten, posse!"" Um, yeah. That's exactly what it's like. The one thing that IS exactly the same here as it is at home is Starbucks, right to the chalk board behind the counter. I got a Frappuchino and secretly and silently thanked mass globalization. When traveling in such a different country, you do get this global perspective you'd never get reading and book or watching some documentary. But you also get culture shocked. At some point, and I hit that point yesterday, the communication barriers, the heat, the wierd food, the lack of tact, the pushy packed sidewalks...it all gets to you. But, I guess that's the point. I came back to the hotel and watched Sparticus on HBO. Before dinner, we ALL needed a drink, and went to the bar on the top floor. They have a lovely little appetizer spread and free booze and we got quite comfortable. For dinner, we hit 1221, a trendy Chinese restaurant favored by ex-patriots. This seemed good, because the food here really is different. And, not in a good way. 1221 has Chinese food like you and I think of Chinese food. It rocked, we went through 2 bottles of wine, and I think I agreed to produce dad's election night show. After dinner, mom and Alex hit the sack, but dad and I hit the Mezz Lounge and had some Santori. I passed out (literally) at midnight, and awoke hungover and hideous at 6am. I gotta say, when dad decides to toe one on, it's hard to keep up. But overhwlmingly entertaining. As we got on the elevator, he says, ""Well Bethy. Those are all my secrets."" Wait. I've already forgotten all the good gossip he just told me. Fuck! We're off to Beijing this morning. I'm a little sketchy about this flying domestically in China, for two reasons. One, the bag weight limitations are fierce, and I've, of course, purchased half of Shanghai, and Two, This is a 3rd World country. I'm not so familliar with their pilot training. Well, if I die, I die. But at least I'll be wearing Cartier. (Which is still ticking....mom predicts it'll be dead by Honk Kong. Whatever. This from the woman that bought fake Louis Vuitton sunglasses...) Beijing...Interesting. Here's to hoping there's an uprising. Maybe, I'll start one!",female,26,Arts,Aquarius,1
481614,3751913,2004-08-10,"Oh my god. Where to begin? First of all, normally, I write in the afternoon, but last night was so nuts and I was wide awake at 5:30, that I had to get it all down now. Alex and I decide to come down to the hotel bar early and have a drink. We've been doing this every night and we love the staff at Mezz, the mellow jazz bar on the 2nd floor. We've become kinda palsy with the staff and no longer have to order. They simply bring us our wine and beer. John, the waiter there, keeps telling Alex, ""You sister so beautiful. I no pay attention to you."" ""Perhaps you two would like to be alone?"" jokes Alex. I think John took it a little too seriously. Soon dad showed up and we were off. Dressed to the nines, we took a cab to dinner at M on the Bund, kind of a cross between Postrio and a W Hotel restaurant. It was super trendy and right up my alley. Mom wanted to see some more pictures on the walls and huge floral arrangements, but it's the kind of place I'd hang out in if I lived here. Dinner was extraordinary, literally. The food was flawless Mediterranian fusion and we were all in heaven. Immediately after dinner, we had to run over to the Peace Hotel, as we had reservations to hear some jazz. Now, if you'll recall, this was MY idea. I love Jazz clubs and envisioned some sort of 1930's dimly lit Chinese version of the Cotton Club. As if walking the 5 jam-packed blocks in gold stilettos weren't traumatic enough, a block away I ran into an old, depressing beggar. As I tried to walk around him, he reached for my handbag, which I held in the air. Being about a foot taller than him, the clutch was perfectly safe. I, however, was not, as he then grabbed me around the waist and basically tried to rip me apart. I screamed bloody murder, mom kicked his cane, and we ran across the street clutching each other and desperate to find dad and Alex, who seemed to be lost in the crowd. They, of course, missed all of this and when told, didn't really care. Nice. Shaking, I drag everyone into the Peace Hotel, which looks significantly tackier and cheaper than described, and inquired as to the jazz. Pointed in the right direction, we follow the ""music"" and enter what appears to be a poorly decorated beer hall filled with tank topped Germans and Koreans who have their picture taken with their waiters. A band made up of 90 year old Chinese men plays ""In The Mood"", as we check in and our shown to our table, front and center. First of all, I feel like an idiot walking in there dressed so fabulously. But, that was the least of our problems. Just as we sit down, a dreadful, middle aged, Maitre'd appears out of nowhere and screams, ""No. You no sit here. Table reserved. You move. Come with me."" ""Wait."" We say. ""What are you talking about? That woman sat us here. We made reservations."" ""No, table broken. You sit here."" He motions miles away, to the back of the cellar. I think I saw a rat scurry across the floor as I get in his face and say, ""Go talk to that woman. We made a reservation. "" He runs off to the front desk and returns. ""Me so sorry. You go back and sit."" Like assholes, we walk in front of the band again and sit back at the origional table. All a little wierded out, especially as this huge scene was made about us, we attempt to order drinks. As they have no wine by the glass and I'm pissed, I have an Evian. Dad attempts to order a Santori, because, ""for relaxing times, make it Santori time"", but is brought a Gin and Tonic instead. The music is dreadful, compounded by the fact that they have a laminated set list on the table. Songs include, ""Denny Boy"" and ""My Heart Left in San Francisco."" Typos aside, other songs consisted of favorites like ""La Cucaracha"" and and ""Mambo #5"". ""This isn't jazz."" whispers Alex. No fucking shit. The trumpet punctures my eardrum, and we agree to down our drinks and get the fuck out of there. In the cab, we all decide we need a real drink, and Alex and I insist we go to Mezz. John is delighted to see us, and immediately brings Alex's beer and my wine. Dad gets his Santori and mom, needless to say, has Chardonnay. We're having a lovely time, listening to real jazz, when John nervously comes up to the table. ""You such nice family. It so good to see you and serve you. I want to give you special gift."" He's holding a red velvet box, with gold embroidery on top saying, ""St. Regis. Shanghai."" ""I present to you."" he states looking at me, and he hands me the box. On the spot, with Alex stiffling hysterics, I open said box to reveal gorgeous chocolate truffles. ""Oh, John. That's so sweet. You're so nice. How lovely."" He kind of smiles, and then sprints away. My family can barely stand it, they find this so funny, but I dive into my chocolates and curse the Peace Hotel. The Mezz Lounge is awesome. When we finish our drinks, John returns again. ""You from America, yes? You know the television, uh, Growing Pains?"" And then, the most fabulous event occurred. He pumps his fist and screams, ""Michael Seaver!"" Seriously. That's brilliant. Alex goes, ""You know Boner?"" ""Oh Boner! I like Boner."" We laugh, get up to leave, and say, we'll be back tomorrow. ""Oh no. I no here tomorrow. So sad. I no see you."" Dad shakes his hand, which sends him into bliss, and I consider hugging him. Rethinking that maybe that's not the best idea, I thank him profusly and leave. I think it's safe to say, drop my name at the Mezz lounge, and they'll take care of you.",female,26,Arts,Aquarius,1
481615,3751913,2004-08-09,"Last night, we went to this restaurant recommended by the conceierge, serving traditional Shanghai and Hongzou food which is supposed to be fabulous. Upon arrival, we were greeted by 5 (yep, 5) yellow clad greeters, all of whom said, ""Good morning."" Each of us selected some menu items, and when the head waiter was sent over, he informed us that we wouldn't like several of them, and thus, insisted we order something else. ""You no like. You Westerner. It too different for you."" Whatever. When I attempted to order a glass of wine, I was told wine was only available by the bottle. Fine. Am I allowed to have a fucking bottle? Indeed I am. Within 20 minutes, dinner was fabulous and hilarious, and we all stumbled over to see the acrobats. It was actually pretty entertaining, with lots of plate spinning and tiny girls who could do the unspeakable with thier bodies. Mother sat next to some people from Indianapolis, and afterwards, when asked about her chat with them, she replied, ""They're the reason George Bush is going to win."" This morning, I can tell you, was one of the most incredible mornings of my life. Alex and I got up early, and were in the gym by 7. By 8:30, we were gloriously fed and in a cab on our way to some park. Mom and Dad's best friends, Dori and Greg, spent 3 weeks in Shanghai last year, and insisted we get to this park before 9. Apparently, all kinds of older Chinese people do tai chi and ballroom dancing and singing in the park every morning. I sounded interesting enough, so off we went. Immediately, we could tell this place was awesome. It's a huge square park, and there were 20 or so groups of people, all doing different things. One group was made up of 15 older women, all dancing in unison with fans, another group danced with swords. 70 people, arranged by height, sang all kinds of folk songs. Everyone seemed to have a little go cart with a tape player attached, knocking out the background music. We couldn't stop taking photos, as everything looked like it was right out of a PBS documentary. Towards the far end of the park, there were maybe 50 couples, all doing ballroom dancing to a go-cart boom box. A huge crowd of locals surrounded them, and they were clearly the biggest group at the park. All of a sudden, as I stood taking pictures, an old little Chinese man comes up and motions for me to dance with him. ""Oh no, I'm no good."" Mom pushed me forward, and the next thing I know, I'm ballroom dancing with this guy, and a bunch of other couples. The locals find this hilarious, as does, needless to say, the rest of my family. The song was long, and our dance kicked ass. This guy, while having 3 teeth, was pretty good, and twirled and dipped me for what seemed like an eternity. It was adorable, and the entire time, I kept thinking, ""I'm in mother-fucking Shanghai dancing with some old, toothless Fred Astaire in a public park at 9am."" The song ended, the crowd errupted into laughter and applause, my dance partner and I hugged and bowed to each other, and off I went. It was incredible, unexpected, and awesome. We explored the rest of the park, watched some old people playing cards and spitting, and headed off to see some tea garden in another section of town. Not before, of course, dad bought himself a can of beer. You can all call me an alcoholic as much as you want, but Dick Spotswood downed a Tsing Tao before 10am, and I've got a picture of it. I bought a can of something called ""Hey Song Sasparilla"" which will travel the world with me and don my mantle when I get home. The tea garden was interesting, really because our cab got pulled over and we had to deal with the fucking Commie police. The dude was a complete asshole and we took pictures this dreaded fuzz while giving him dirty looks. After lunch, mom, Alex and I went to the antique market and got all kinds of old crap. Because I am the greatest fag hag in the world, I bought Andy a 1930's opium pipe which may or may not get through customs. I didn't score any opium, but I think we can figure out a way to make it work. I also purchased a Chairman Mao poster, army bag, and musical lighter, while Alex got a fake Rolex for his best friend. All in all, a beyond successful day. Tonight, it's dinner at some fancy place called ""M on the Bund"", and then 1930's jazz at the Peace Hotel, apparently famous for it's jazz. This is the one place I've picked to go to, so I hope it works out. You never know, though. The things you think will be awesome often suck, and then you show up at some public park at the break of dawn and end up dancing the morning away with a charming, toothless Asian man. Ah, travel...",female,26,Arts,Aquarius,1
481616,3751913,2004-08-09,"Today, in addition to experiencing Chinese culture and shit, I bought 2 Tiffany bracelets, 1 Tiffany necklace, 2 North Face backpacks, Channel and Ray Ban sunglasses, and a Cartier watch, all for about $60, US. Although, it nearly came to fistacuffs several times. These people didn't know who they were dealing with. I'm no yokle tourist. I've haggled all over the world, I can haggle here. ""Hey pretty lady. You want Burberry? You like Channel? Vuitton? Yes, you like. You name me good price."" They grab arms and pull on bags. It's intense. Then, they pull out a calculator and type in a price. Next, I grab the calculator and cut the price in half. This continues until I pretend to walk away, and suddenly, everything's practically free. They catch on quick, listening to us talk, and then yelling, ""Hey Alex. You like North Face? Alex? Alex, you want Tag Hauer? You like Gucci?"" Incredible. This exists in every major city here, and apparently, they crack down at the airports. Fools. I'm shipping it all back. This is glorious. Long Live China! Tonight, it's acrobats. Maybe, they'll pull Alex onstage. For now, Alex is getting some aromatherapy massage and I'm about to go read my scary books. Maybe, I'll have some tea sent up. Whenever you run into any staff here, it's ""Good day, madam."" ""It is my pleasure, madam."" Make eye contact and it's, ""What can I get you, madam?"" Nothing. I'm in the elevator. I hope I'm not being racist, as these people are Chinese, not Japanese, but I find myself bowing a lot. Ah well. Me foreign tourist. No know culture in China. Me learn to say words. Actually, all I ever say is shei shei, which is Thank You. And then, I bow.",female,26,Arts,Aquarius,1
481617,3751913,2004-08-07,"With 17 million people, Shanghai is twice the size of New York City. Needless to say, today I got lost. We had dinner last night at The Grand Hyatt, on the 55th floor overlooking some huge, lit, globe representing some Olympics of the future. I was so exhausted, I don't even remember getting back to our hotel. We passed out around 11, and Alex and I awoke easilly at 5:30 this moring. Wide awake and rarin' to go, I decided to work out as soon as the gym opened at 6am, and then swam 25 laps. By 7:30, we went to the huge breakfast buffet here and gorged ourselves until it was time to meet up with mom, dad, Rei the guide, and her nameless driver, in the lobby. I saw all kinds of Chinese people having chow mein and beef stir fry for breakfast. I had a croissant, scrambled eggs, bacon, fruit, and the greastest cup of coffee ever made. Rei took us first to the older part of town where it looks very imperialistic and British, but with bicycles and rickshaws everywhere. We toured a small museum there, and everyone stared at us. Then, she took us to this school in an old brick building, where we actually sat in on classes filled with 6 year olds. Literally, the 4 of us found ourselves in tiny classrooms, with little kids instructed to perform for us. An entire class sang us two songs, then a room full of tiny little ballerinas did a fabulous interpretive dance for us. We saw calligraphy and art classes as well. It was awesome. We just walked in and interupted their classes, and they acted like this was the most normal thing in the world. As we left each class, they all said in unison, ""Nice to make your aquaintance!"" Upon departure from the school, the teachers kind of rangle you into an office/giftshop where they encourage you to support the school by buying crap. So we did. Mother was desperate to go to some Jesuit cathedral, because apparently every catholic cathedral in Europe in't enough for her. Poor Rei took us there, as I asked her to describe Buddhism. Hello, Joanne. If we're going to hit the churches, as you insist on doing in every foreign country, maybe we should check out a temple. I think I've got this Christianity thing down. Then, Rei drags us to this rug factory, which everyone else claimed to be fascinated by, but I found boring. Plus, they practically force you to buy rugs, which we didn't. Please let it be time for lunch. It was. Rei informs us that we'll be having Mongolian BBQ, and it was totally bizarre. This place is hugely touristy, as we were 4 of many ""roundeyes"" in there. The deal is this: you grab a bowl, then fill it with an assortment of raw meat, vegetables, and various sauces. You bring it to a window, and some dude throws it on a flaming metal disk. Once it's cooked, he throws it back in your bowl, and badda bing, stir. They also had a salad bar, where the two salad dressings available were ketchup and ""Egg Mayonaise"". Thank you, no. It's at this point that I start to feel violently ill. Mom and I go to the ladies, where we discover that you flush the toilet by pulling an old rope attached to the base. The women next to us spoke in German, the only word of which I understood was SARS. After lunch, Rei decided we'd hit The Shanghai Museum of Art, which is pretty interesting. I'm very into the furniture and the clothing. They had jade bracelets from 37BC and Tibetian prayer robes that blew my mind. But, as I still felt like ass, I told mom I was cabbing it back to the hotel and split. My big plan to get back here was to take a postcard of the hotel and show it to the driver. In China, you sit in the front seat of the cab, and as no one speaks any English, must find ways to explain where you're going in a city this fucking huge. He seemed to understand the postcard. Turns out, not so much. Thru tunnels and over bridges, through the ghettos of Shanghai and the highrise, tacky apartment complexes, we drove and drove, nearly killing many along the way. 25 minutes into the ride, I pull out the postcard again. I point to the chinese writing at the bottom. The driver gets a look of horror on his face, as he flips the car around and hightails it in the opposite direction. An hour later, here I am. The cab ride cost me 3 bucks. Not bad. And I've seen more of Shanghai than the cast of the Joy Luck Club. I've got to say, for as jet lagged and food poisoned as I am, this is one of the most fascinating and different places I've ever seen. It's extraordinary the number of people and the level of culture. I feel that we, as Americans, are nothing but cultureless cowboys. Everything looks different, from the cars (today, I drove in a VW ""Santana"") to the buildings, which range from old Chinese structures with ducks and wet clothes in the window, to Vegas-like monstrosities with orbes and flashing lights. For a Communist country, there's a huge difference between the rich and the poor, which I don't really get. I'm kinda chicken to ask Rei pointed questions, although mom had no problem pointing out to the rug factory guy that since he had one son and no daughters, he must be delighted. ""Don't you people prefer boy babies?"" Nice. We have our own private butler named Ken, and I'm about to go upstairs and ask him to send my clothes to laundry and bring me some tea. I wonder if Ken can handle me sending underwear to be washed? There's only one way to find out. I think it's interesting that we come all the way to China to a hotel that gives you butlers, and his name is Ken. I asked mom and dad if their butler was named Troy. Mom didn't get it. Tonight, it's the 1930's jazz club at the Peace Hotel, I think. At least, that's my vote. For now, it's to tea and then, to sleep. I hope this blog thing works from here. E-mail me and let me know. Sheshe. (That's thank you.) PS. Today, at lunch, my dad goes, ""You know who'd love this? Bonnie."" Um, yeah dad. She would. Bon, hop a flight. Dick feels like buying you a Chinese beer.",female,26,Arts,Aquarius,1
481618,3751913,2004-08-05,"Here I am in gorgeous Shanghai. This is fucking awesome. But first things first. ...and now, a minute by minute account of the past 14 hours of my life... At check in, we were told that the probability of Alex and my being upgraded was high. We were instructed to wait to board, and if spaces were still available in Business Class, we'd get them. Long story short; they weren't. We angrilly flew coach and I decided to entertain myself by detailing the hell I knew I was about to endure. 2:15pm PST, We're scheduled to take off now. Why aren't we? The movies are 50 First Dates, Hidalgo, and Shrek 2. Um, no thanks. 2:45pm, Fuck You United. I'm listening to an electronic device during take off. 3:03pm, Take off 3:15pm, fill out foreign entry cards, befriend gay steward, Jason, whom I now love. 3:25pm, start drinking shitty wine. (Brooks Hollow cabernet. Beware!) I bet they have better wine in Biz. Class. 3:51pm, start to pretend I'm on my own private plane, jetsetting across the globe. Alex wants to know why I'm still wearing sunglasses as I read Elle. 5:30pm, Extreme boredom setting in. Mom stopped by to rub in coach. Mix of Vallium and wine making me begin to cry at Avril Levigne (sp?) song? Worrisome. 6:15pm, I hate all music. I've read my Elle twice and am too antsy to read my book. Sent Dad to get us Biz. Class snacks. Are we there yet? Starting to hate those around me. 6:20pm, Dad brought us cheese and grape plate. Consumed in 2 minutes as we didn't want to get caught with fancy snacks. I wonder what all my friends are doing? 6:31pm, have become fascinated by cheapest pillow in the history of air travel. 6:35pm, I'm starting to hate my outfit. 7:15pm, Dad appears with sandwiches, chips, and Toblerone. Fuckin' Biz Class. 8:00pm, disccovered Chinese man across from Alex reading United's copies of Ebony and Shape En Espanol. Curious. 8:25pm, Jason the steward stopped by with a list of great places in Shanghai and Beijing for pearls, knock offs, and cheap massages. Fabulous. 9:00pm, bizarre snack of Chinese Cuo O' Noodles, mini-apple, and short bread. Gave Alex gross soup. I hope Dad keeps the snack train coming. 9:10pm, forced to tackle stewardess for coffee. I bet they have biscotti in Biz Class. 9:28, Alex is fascinated with woman across from him who keeps staring in his direction.

Convinced I should get a Scissor Sisters logo tattoo somewhere on me.

Some one just applied a gallon of cologne. Damn you, Duty Free... 2:40, Alex pipes up, ""It looks like rice paddies."" All flight attendants congratulating us for surviving coach, especially Jason. Alex wonders aloud how gays always find me immediately. I'm blessed, I guess. 2:45am, (5:45pm Shanghai time) Touchdown. Holy Shit, we're in China. We were met at the airport by Rei, our fabulous little guide. We made it to this gorgeous hotel within and hour of landing and are getting ready to go to the Grand Hyatt's ""Canton"" for some swanky dinner. It's 5am to me right now. And I'm not that tired.

481620,3751913,2004-08-04,"...when Bon and I posted our craigslist ad on Valentine's Day. We were cracking ourselves up last night recalling our adventures, and we are desperate to find that ad. I can't believe we didn't save it. For those of you who don't know the legendary Valentine's Day story of 2004, let me enlighten you. This past Valentine's Day, Bon and I found ourselves home with no dates and nothing to do. This struck us as ridiculous. Seriously. It was a crime. We woke up and wandered around the flat, moaning and bitching about this stupid holiday that no one really likes anyway. Finally, we decided, ""Fuck it."" Bonnie went into the kitchen to stir up some alcoholic brew at 11am, and I went in my room to create my costume. When I emerged, Bonnie caught on fast and went into her room to change as well. By noon, we were both drunk, wearing pink lingerie, little black cardigans, high heels, with flowers in our hair and crazy make-up. It is at this point, that we decided it'd be a good idea to explain our situation to the world and post an ad on Craigslist. The ad went a little something like this: We're so bored this Valentine's Day that we're....already drunk! We're 2 twenty-something vixens who are baffled by the fact that we don't have dates. Thus, we've dressed up in ridiculous lingerie inspired outfits, inebriated ourselves, and are looking for love in all the wrong places. We look like an episode of Oprah gone awry. The men in the white coats are not far off. Rescue us. B+B We received 132 responses. With 2 computers set up on the sun porch, we set to the task of narrowing our options. Bon created various folders in our joint e-mail account, entitled: Mr. Right, Possibly, Not So Much, Naked Boys, and Never. Needless to say, when you announce that you and your girlfriend are drunk, wearing pink lacey slips, and lookinâ for action, you get a myriad of replies, mostly of the dirty variety. With a mixture of vodka, lemonade, and crushed fresh strawberries (to make it pink, of course), we came to a list of about 5 possibilities, including one guy who just wanted to come over and watch us get ready to go out. He was hot, but creepy. He got moved into the Not So Much category. I spent a bit of time e-mailing back and forth with 2 Australian guys in town to sell copy machine products. They seemed cute, friendly, and funny. We agreed. Australians it would be. Once we decided we were actually going to meet these 2 guys, we got all hysterical and excited. âOh my god. Are we really doing this?â âFuck yes, weâre really doing this. Go put on slutty clothes.â We decided to meet them in North Beach, and nervously got in a cab. We were kind of early, so we sat at the bar and drank. Suddenly, in walks this guy that is obviously one of the Australians. He is Kym, and his friend Ben is parking. Ben finally arrives, we all find a table, and start to talk. Theyâre adorable! Theyâre nice and funny and not at all gross. Theyâre incredibly chivalrous, touchy feely, and super cute. Plus, those accents. We hit a few bars before they propose dinner. Um, dinner? Okay. We go to some romantic Italian place and have a marvelous time, with Bonnie and I kicking each other under the table through most of the meal. At around midnight, we head over to Cappâs, and grab some more drinks. By closing time, weâre delightedly drunk and ready to head home. We thank them for a lovely time, kiss them goodbye, hop in a cab, and erupt into hysterics. We could not have had a better time with anyone else. Kym and Ben rock. The next day, the called just to make sure we got home okay. Yeah, guys. Weâre really fucking okay. Viva Australia!",female,26,Arts,Aquarius,1
481621,3751913,2004-08-03,"Bon and I just got back from dinner at Foreign Cinema. We split the cheapest bottle of red they had and ended up having an in depth discussing on sex. We were laughing so hard, I think we offended the next table, but screw them. They were French. Our waiter (also French) was a total asshole, and I think he was silently judging us. Whatever. You can take my dirty plate away now, you frog. I returned home to an e-mail from my friend Christine who was worried that there'd be no blog updates while I'm in China. Fear not. It's the land of technology. I'll be filling everyone in on my adventures near daily. I hear they have a wall there. I'll be sure to tell you guys all about it.",female,26,Arts,Aquarius,1

481624,3751913,2004-08-01,"Last night, I watched Tom Cruise: Inside the Actorâs Studio. Oh. My. God. What a freak.  Have I told you my theory about huge, international celebrities? I maintain, that once you reach a certain level of celebrity, you begin to lose your gauge of whatâs normal and whatâs not. So many people fawn over every little thing you say, you can basically do no wrong, and people always laugh at your jokes. You have no gauge of when youâre being funny or not, when you sound smart or not, when youâre making an ass of yourself to us regular people, because you are surrounded (whether you want to be or not) by people who do nothing but kiss your ass. I have 3 excellent examples of this. 1. My friend Lauren is currently an actress in LA. Prior to this, she was an actress in New York. While there, she appeared as slut #2 in a Ricky Martin video. She found herself filming a scene in a nightclub, squished into a booth with Ricky and some other skanks, and having to talk to Ricky in between takes. He spoke of Puerto Rico and his love for water. At one point, a production assistant piped up and said, âOh Ricky. I love water, too.â Ricky high fives this jackass, and the entire nightclub applauds. 2. While watching a âMaking of The Gladiatorâ on HBO, I observed Russell Crowe (thatâd be Oscar winning Russell Crowe) wandering around the set pretending his sword was a penis. This is in the background, while the director is being interviewed. When itâs finally Russellâs turn to be interviewed, he cracks some off-color jokes to the dead silence around him. He then spits, gets up, and walks away. 3. Finally, we come to the great Kevin Spacey, who has so many gauge infractions, I donât know where to begin. At a televised tribute to the Beatles, he performed âMind Gamesâ onstage (entirely solo), while sweating and dancing around like a drunk uncle at a wedding. I could see him at some meeting months before, coming up with this grand scheme to show off his skills, and no one, not even his closest advisors, had the balls to say, âUh, Mr. Spacey. Perhaps thatâs not the best idea.â Worse, recently, he was cruising some gay park in London at 4am, let some tweaker steal his cell, called the cops and said he was mugged, and then called back and said, nope, actually I gave some tweaker my phone. I lied before. âOh, no problem, Mr. Spacey. We all understand. (snicker, snicker.)â  The point is, at a certain level, you can no longer tell what is acceptable behavior and what is not, because you have an entourage of 27 people who give you a standing ovation every time you take a shit. Tom Cruise has reached that point. Last night, on Inside the Actorâs Studio, I became so embarrassed for him, I was forced to change the channel. I took notes. Hold on. Iâll get them. Fist of all, heâs taller than James Lipton, which letâs you know how fucking short Lipton is. Interesting. Tom has trouble answering direct questions. When asked about childhood financial hardships early in the interview, Tom goes off into this diatribe about how those hardships build character and gets all philosophical, to the point of not making sense. Shut up, Tom. We just wanted to hear about how you had to gut fish or clean train station bathrooms. Save the propaganda for the Q&A. And talk about father issues. When asked why he changed his name, he practically hit James Lipton for suggesting he wanted to disassociate himself from his father. After 10 minutes of ass kissing and coddling, Tom says he changed his name because he wanted to disassociate himself from his father. Hello? Every question sent him off into some intense personal place of incoherent justification of god knows what. He rambles and pontificates and never comes to a point. (Yeah, I know, I know. Shut the fuck up.) Of course, they touch on the movies that Tom wants to talk about. Sure, thereâs no mention of Losinâ It or All the Right Moves. But no Cocktail? Come on! We spend 45 minutes on Vanilla Sky, and no fucking Cocktail? Thatâs a bunch of malarkey. The thing is, even though Tom Cruise is practically from another planet, itâs not really his fault. He became a superstar at 21, and as we all know, 21 year old men are very, very stupid. So, people have been telling him heâs a genius since then. Plus, look at him. My god, heâs glowing. They showed all kinds of baby pictures, and Tom was a strikingly good looking toddler. Heâs gorgeous, and even though he makes no sense and can barely function, heâs so fucking beautiful, you just smile and nod along with everyone else. Keep talking, pretty boy. We donât care about what youâre saying, we just want to see those teeth. I would just like to take this opportunity to say that you fine people have no problem telling me when Iâm making an ass of myself. When Iâm a huge, international celebrityâ¦you can all kiss my ass like crazy. Iâm going to dress like a drag queen and publicly sing and pretend my sword is a penis. Why? Because I can, thatâs why. Isnât that the whole point of being famous?",female,26,Arts,Aquarius,1

481627,3751913,2004-08-01,"Yesterday, Alex, Kelsey, and I saw The Village. And today, I went to an 11am showing of The Manchurian Candidate. Hereâs what I can report: We had heard that the Village is pretty predictable. Everyone always expects M. Night Shyamalan to have some big twisty surprise ending, and he did. Yeah, I called it half way through, but none the less, it was still not horrible. We expected to be scared out of our wits and as we walked into the theater, Kelsey asks the movie staff if the movie is scary. âOh, not as scary as if I were to rip your head off and drink whatâs inside.â Nice. I think I can speak for Kelsey and myself by saying that the highlight of The Village is Joaquin Pheonix. I just want him to come rescue me from perilous situations. Heâs dreamy. The Manchurian Candidate sucked. Seriously. Iâve always been a Liev Schreiber fan (see Daytrippers. Heâs hilarious.) and I truly worship Meryl Streep. One of my favorite things is seeing a movie alone as early in the day as humanly possible. I have never seen the original, so I had nothing to compare it to. I was in the mood for a good thriller. And Jonathan Demme directed one of the greatest movies ever made, Silence of the Lambs. I was anticipating a solid 2 hours of seriously good film. I was totally let down. Keep in mind, I hate Denzel Washington, based mostly on the fact that he was a dick when I saw him on Charlie Rose. And Iâm not a science fiction kind of gal. But this thing was the most anti-climactic experience of my life, and thatâs saying something. I want my cash back. Iâd rather give it to the hobo so he can buy some tuna.",female,26,Arts,Aquarius,1

With one swing of the bat, Barry has inched even closer to yet another one of Ruth's records.  Bonds crushed his 35th home run of this season, 693th all-time in Sunday's game. Earlier today, he was given ""National League Player of the Week"" honors with higher than a 1.5 slugging average, .700 on base percentage, and hitting .600 in the time span. Truly remarkable. Tip your hats, you guys.  You are in the presence of a legend.       Okay so some updates about the   non-legandary   me.       Last Thursday Night, one of my oldest friends and his sister came over to spend the night and ended up staying all day Friday too. It was really cool, almost like ole times. Since we only see each other maybe 1-2 times a year, I really value the time I get to spend with the guy. Some funny stuff. Friday night, my grandparents came over, and my friend's parents and we all had dinner together. That also was pretty cool. After they left my dad put on this hindi movie, Lakshya. It was pretty good(at least for the part I watched). One of the songs really struck home.       Saturday, I cleaned my desk. Watched the Giants. Watched the Niners. Slept.       Sunday, we went school shopping and to the temple. I think I saw Sapna in Walmart. lol. At night, I went to my grandma's house to spend the night, and ended up meeting one of my aunties. So another little family reunion there.       Today, I spent the morning running chores for my grandma and trying to avoid my grandpa. Now it's not like I don't love him or anything, I do but sometimes I don't have the strength in me to put up with him. How my grandma does it, I have no idea.       Then around 1, I went to AHS to pick up my maze day packet. Turns out that the office doesn't open til 1:30. So I was just waiting there and I ran into Adrienne. That was cool. lol. We talked and walked a little and then we discovered that Mrs. T was in her room! So we walked in and talked with her for a while. This world needs more teachers like Mrs. T, seriously (not to say there aren't other good teachers at AHS or anything). Frankly, all my classes have had their own story, some good, some not but now that I look back at it, I have no regrets. Okay, so after we hung out at Mrs. T's, I had a ASB meeting to go to concerning primarily major club status for next year. No offense to anyone who might possibly take offense to this, but the meeting was a complete waste of time. I have no problem against major clubs, but at the same time I realize that the chess club will never become one (as a lot of people choose to make fun of during the meeting). Heck for the record, the AHS Chess Club/ Chess Team is   #1   in the Golden State of California. How's that for major?! Laugh all you want. Okay, back to point, major clubs ( or rather having incentive for clubs that do well) is a good idea but the way that it will be implented leaves a lot to be desired. If you do well in the previous year, you will get privledges the next year which you don't necessarily deserve at the time. Lets say for example your the world's best club in 2000, doesn't mean you'll continue to be that great in 2001 but now you have extra fundraising weeks, cash etc etc. I have no problem with clubs duking it out for the title. People seem to forget that this is high school, and we will be   gone   in 1-2 years.  Oh well, not my problem.       What a wonderful world...         Anyways, after the meeting, I was just hanging with people, talking. It was a moment of realization for me.

I mean not only cuz of what happened lately but just because he was one of the people closed to me that i could actually talk to. and now thats not even an option. today, my dad came home was being stupid and usually i just call jason but i really couldnt. :( then my mom came home and they started to fight again. but now im sitting here with nothing to do? so i thought id blog again.

527053,4126520,2004-08-04,"Tonight was the worst night of my entire life. OMG I hate my life it totally sucks so bad. And I messed it up even more. Jason and I had been arguing for a while now and things were getting rough and so frustrating. I've cried my eyes out, screamed my head off, sat here and thought about whats important and what's not. And maybe me and Jason weren't meant to be ya know maybe things just didn't work out the way I planned. And I'm so sad and upset right now. My face burns from crying and my nails are bitten down to the skin, I feel as if I just got pushed down and kicked in the stomach a thousand times. :( I feel like crap that's a good way to put it I guess. I mean I love Jason so much and we had all we needed. It was so awesome; I loved him, he loved me, we loved each other. He was my best friend. He is my best friend. And right now I regret breaking up with him, maybe it will help us both in the end? I hope....I pray!?  I mean I lost everything I cared about everything I loved. I gave up on what little we had left. I didn't know what to do. I was scared. I was lost. I was so confused. And the worst part of it is I don't think he even trusted me when I told him I loved him. I mean it truly hurt me....So bad...So deep. It feels like the world just stopped or life just ended. I mean it sounds stupid I just truly genuinely love him.

I don't get points if you go to their site, or money or a special autograph if you buy their CD.  They are simply a really amazing music group.  This is my last pre-vacation entry, so it better be good, eh?  I don't want you to think of me as a loser for the next month.  First off, it's important to wish everyone a Happy Birthday who I will be missing while gone:  Kryzilla, Sam, Josie, Lexi, Courtney, and everyone else.  I love you, I miss you, and I'll make y'all banners when I get back!  Secondly, I got invited to the beach by a hot guy!  Haha, I was at work, eating a strawberry starburst.

Did the color orange or the fruit orange come first?  Depending on which one did, does that mean that the tangerine was named for the color?  Or the color was named for the fruit?    Now that I've confused everyone, I'd like to show you a picture of the shoes I'd like:      I saw these shoes at Famous Footwear today, and I need them.  Really. Bad.  But, I didn't have any money, and my mom wasn't going to give me a cash advance.  I never seem to remember whether I paid her or not when she does that, and most of the time, I think I pay her back twice.  Not fun.  But, I'm getting a paycheck two days after I come back from vacation, and I should have around 16 hours on it.  Which is nice.  And then I'll go back and buy them.  Because I seriously doubt they'll be sold out.  I showed them to my grandma, and I could tell she thought I was joking:  ""Grandma, look!""  This is Cindie, trying to bond with her Grandma.  Yes, I shouldn't have picked shoes as a topic, but so?  ""Oh?""  ""Don't you like them?""  ""Do you?""  ""Um, yeah.""  Can you feel the air coming out the bubble that just burst?

533704,3697773,2004-06-20,"I can't think of a creative title for this one.  Maybe it will come to me as I write it.  My dad is watching ""The Others"" right now.  He's had it on every time its been on.  Considering the fact that it's been on TNT about 460286082 times in the past week, it's a pretty safe assumption to say he's seen the whole thing.  Yet, he watches on.  And yes, this  is  coming from the girl that has watched bits and pieces of Miracle for a record eight days straight.  Oops, I'm a hypocrite.  I finally told the last person I wanted to tell that I'm going away on vacation.  I feel incredibly stupid doing so, but there was no way around it.  So I made up some crap story about my aunt staying over my house for the month, so that she doesn't go tell all her friends ""Hey, Cindie's house is empty for the month, lets party, crash, and take all her music because we're  evil "".  Fun.  I can see it happening too.  The Mets are on.  They are over .500, and I'm so proud of them.  No, I don't know any of them personally, but I hate seeing them lose.  And I know that when you're a fan, you don't want to see your team lose, that kind of goes hand in hand, but its always heartbreaking and I wish I could do something about it.  So, yeah, its good that they're winning now.  I wish other people would just shut their mouths about them now.  Hmm, I guess I should mention the fact that HPB is down, again.  It'll more than likely be up again in July, but I won't be there, so that kind of annoys me.  I don't want to miss a months worth of things, I don't want to miss any games, I don't want to miss SSW.  But, there isn't a gosh darn thing I can do about it.  I'm just mad I can't get online to switch my signature so people know I'm gone, and that I haven't abandoned the boards.  Hopefully they'll be able to figure that out on their own, though.  We're a pretty smart bunch ;).  While uploading songs onto my iPod, I've discovered a whole bunch of music that I don't listen to anymore.  Take Rubyhorse, for example.  I can't remember the last time I listened to that CD.

533705,3697773,2004-06-20,"Important Note:  I wrote this yesterday night upstairs, so yeah, its all past tense.  I'm not crazy.  My dad got his GPS system today, and so begins the love affair that tears my family apart.  For example, he is now, downstairs, on our family computer, downloading maps and spazzing out on a message board about it.  Cough, no, I don't  spaz  on message boards.  But then again, I don't go on fun ones that deal with global positioning devices.  Did I mention he's waited two weeks for this thing?  And that he was so obsessed over getting it, he went after the FedEx truck that turned down the other street to get it?  It turned out it wasn't in that truck anyway.  So, he called and complained, and said ""UPS always gets me my packages fast.""  Ouch.  He had to drive me to work today, and he's only gotten it an hour or so before.  They sent it out on another truck.  Thank goodness, because I think if we had to wait one more day, he would have exploded.  The whole thing would have been very Harry Potter of him.  Maybe, if I'm lucky, and it does happen, a funky Knight Bus will come and rescue me from the insanity that is my family, and Commack in general.  He decided this fun, new, GPS system was much more important than his worn out, tired daughter, who needed to get to work in one piece, if possible.  He brought it in the car, because he doesn't drive me to Michael's  every other day , so he couldn't possibly locate it.  He kept staring at it, and finally I took it, hid it on the other side of me, and he couldn't look at it.  Forgive me for wanting to remain alive in the ten minute car ride.  Apparently that is too much to ask.  When he picked me up from work, I was less than happy to see it sitting there, staring at me.  Yes, it won, we know, enough.  And so, its all ""I got it to work!"", and I'm kind of exhausted from standing around doing nothing for half an hour because CJ won't let us leave.  Standing still is more tiring than walking, it's been scientifically proven.  But I have to sit there with this ugly piece of black machinery (with color LCD display!), and follow us home on it.  Joy.  One good thing did come of it, however.  On the way home, we discovered the name of the street that has no name.  Yup, its all out of that U2 song, or whoever ripped off Bono's voice.  Not sure if it is actually U2.  This street has one house, really deep in the trees, and no one ever goes near it.  For all we know, no one lives there.  But, apparently, it has a name.  And this name is so important to me that I forgot it already.  Something with an M.  Righty-o.  I also came up with a stupid idea in which I'm going to use on this new, fun, funky, uberly awesome blog:  a weekly column highlighting the randomness of me.  It'll be called ""The Row"", because that is a fun name for a column, and yeah, it'll be fun!  Watch for it on Friday.  It might involve cars, it might not.  It will involve scrapbooking wizards, which is always fun.  And, more than likely, there will be the mention of hockey.  Brace yourselves.  Who cares if the season is over?",female,17,indUnk,Pisces,1
533706,3697773,2004-06-20,"Yes, thats right, I do consider myself a fangirl.  Not in all respects.  I know I went to the world premiere of PoA, but I wouldn't have gone had it not been for the fact that I also wanted to meet up with people.  I am, however, incredibly and publicly obsessed with Michael Mantenuto.       Yes, I'm cool like that.    Anyways, to get on with my story, I decided to watch the commentary on Miracle.  Its between Gavin O'Connor (the director) and two other people who aren't important enough to remember.  So, they're talking, and we get to the scene where its Jack O'Callahan (aka Michael Mantenuto, der) and Herb Brooks on the big Olympic ice rink.  And they're talking, and he flashes the smile that makes me die, and the commentary is as follows:  Yeah, Kurt was trying to make him give off that sort of ecstatic response, so when he started talking about Michael's daughter, and his face just lit up, we knew we had hit it.   WTF?  A daughter?   So, my excellent detective skills led me to IMDB, where I never really looked at his page because it didn't have any pictures.  And I looked through all the trivia, and found out some pretty interesting information.  His nickname is ""Manto"", which is the cutest thing.   Ever .  And yeah, I scroll down farther, and whoa, they have their cute little ""IMDB message board"".  Wow.  It's the most horrible thing I've ever seen.  I thought I was pretty bad, but these girls are incredibly stupid, and I can picture them sitting there typing madly, crying that he has a daughter and that they'll never ever ever get to sleep with him.  ::tear::    But apparently he's engaged.  Whether that's to the mother of his child or not, I'm not sure, and quite frankly, it really doesn't matter all that much.  But gah, talk about pathetic.  They're all like ""Well, as long as he's happy"", yada yada yada, but you could tell right behind their sugar-coated replies they're like ""DIE DIE DIE"" to the future Mrs. Michael Mantenuto.  Not that I can blame them, but it was quite ridiculous.

533707,3697773,2004-06-20,"Yes, it is I, Cindie, back in familiar territory.  My own personal blog includes ""blogspot.com"" once again, and until you look around a bit, it looks like sophomore year all over again.  The important question:  Why am I here?  It's a question that I asked myself last night, and I think I can finally answer it.  Warning:  Slightly long-winded explanation ahead.  First off, I guess its important to point out my history with blogspot, and with online journals in general.  I started my old blog (link will intentionally not be provided) in May of 2001.  I was a freshman, and I didn't feel well, so I came home from school early.  What scary things a mind can think up when sick and idle for a few hours.  Long before anyone was posting on all of those other sites (or so I think, otherwise that comment is very conceited of me), I was happy with my little home on the web.  Eventually, I learned how to customize it, and I had music, marquis lyrics, and an NHL sportsticker.  Wow, I was the cat's meow. Rawr.  After a year of this, however, the world caught up to me, and everyone (and I mean  everyone ) had a Xanga.  I jumped on the bandwagon.  It lasted all of one month.  Not that that month wasn't eventful, however.  My Xanga outlasted the entire Dave saga.  Dave?  Eh?  If you don't know, don't ask, it's not pretty.  In fact, its partially the reason why I left, and entirely the reason why I deleted every entry I had on there.  Boy am I fun!  So, back to my trusty blogger!  But I was soon dissatisfied with its lack of fun features.  The 10 layouts I had to pick from just weren't enough.  And so, when Liz introduced me to Diaryland, and Beautify, with all of its gorgeous templates, it was a match made in heaven.  I quickly packed up and moved.  But it was Summer 2003, and I had already been given a taste of Livejournal, thanks to dear darling HPB.  LJ icons?  Moods?  A comment system?  It was everything I could possibly want, and more.  IocaineSparrow was born.  However, it was inevitable for Blogger to receive a revamp, and that it did.  When Lauren talked about one of my old, dead blogs last night, I checked out Blogger again, and wow has it changed!  I can have comments, and all that other fun stuff.  All of a sudden, its much better than it used to be.  And, well, here I am!  But, but, didn't you want a paid LJ?  Yeah, I did.  But, when it came down to it, I realized I didn't need it, nor did I have much use for it.  I like making icons, but I'm pretty much content with the three I have.  I don't use the mood function, so I have no need for mood themes, and as far as adding things to the layout, well, I just did that here.    And what about the Friends Only thing?  Yeah, well, I'll have to give it up.  I kind of want my Commack friends to be able to read it.  And, if certain skeeves who shalt not be named (although its pretty obvious of whom I speak about) happen to stumble across this, well, then its back to the old LJ, no harm done.  I'll have to keep my old LJ, of course, so don't remove me from your lists!  I love reading everyone elses, and it makes me feel special to see the ones with the lock on them, muahahaha.  And yeah, there will be occasions when there are things I don't need the whole goddamn world to see, so I'll use it then.  Kudos to y'all who actually read this entire thing.  I'm hoping to stick to this one like I did the other.  So, excuse me while I go change my profile on the 4860369830863 sites I belong to.  molto amore > Cinds  P.S.  My icon journal,  urlLink Color/Blind Icons  will still be open and fully operational.  /shameless pluggage P.P.S.

So, I live in apartment, and for the most part I love it.  The massive problem last year was the frat across the way, literally 10 ft. from my bedroom window, loved to play basketball.  Or as I came to call it ""Bounce bounce F***!"" because every other 10 seconds I would hear two dribbles of a basketball, a clang of the rim and some sort of profanity.    I was increadibly overjoyed to find out the frat house is being torn down.  (PS If you have issues with me calling a ""fraternity"" a ""frat"" do the world a favor and depledge from your house by finding out if you're allergic to bullets.)  But, I found out that the frat lifestyle moved below me.    I wasn't awake for this conversation, but I'll relay the story my roomate told me.    Late one Sunday night, my roomate was up late playing videogames in his room when he heard yelling from outside his window.  He sat up in bed, pulled back his curtains and could just barely make out a group of guys calling each other assorted slang terms for gay people.  He decided to go downstairs to get a better view of the proceedings and ran into our rather favorable neighbors downstairs.  After introducing themselves, meathead 1 and 2 began the conversation:  MH1: Hey, if you guys ever have a problem with our music, could you just call us instead of calling the cops.  We had a lot of problems last year with people calling the cops on us. Roommate: Ok MH1:  This is (introduces MH2).  What bars do you go to around here? R:  Murphy's mostly. MH1:  Cool.  If you ever want the hook up, I work at CO's and this guys a manager at Kam's R:  Right, I'll see you guys later  For the record, Kam's is the bar of choice for dudes that like to use ruffies as their pick up line and women who will do anything to be around jocks.  Kam's also has been shut down on various occations for allowing 13 year olds into the bar, and most recently has been closed for encouraging drinking games by rewarding those that drink the most with more free shots.  Classy joint let me tell you.  I made a pact with my roomate at the beginning of Freshman year never to set foot into that place and I'm proud to say neither of us has ever been.  Cut to Thur. night   In between the VMA's and Cubs blowing another lead in St. Louis, at about 9PM Meathead 1 and 2 decided that we wanted to feel their music.  Not just hear, feel.  Our floor began to reverberate and eventhough our TV was at about 3/4 as loud as it could go, we still couldn't hear the TV, less than five feet from our ears.  I decided to give them a half hour of Techno blasting until the cops were called and 3 min. before the self imposed deadline, the thumping mercfully stopped.  I don't want to get into a war of calling the cops on each other with these two because once my roomate gets his half stack working, he'll be loud too, but jesus, techno sucks.  And I can handle loud music, but when you are shaking the entire floor of someone else, its too loud.  Here's another thought to chew on, if you've had problems with the vol. of your music before, take a clue and turn it down.  We'll see how this plays out.",male,23,Student,Taurus,0
554088,1844606,2004-08-02,"Right, so the first week of classes are done with.  Highlights included:  -After discussing all the advances gay right have made in the past few months, my Sex Teacher (sorry Community Health Professor) asked, ""What happened recently in Canada?"" some jackass yelled out ""SARS!"" It drew a laugh, but the sad thing is, I don't know if the kid was seriously answering the question.  -I'm taking a Post Modern 300 level English class (pomo) if you will and my Professor was a trucker.  I'm not talking delivering auto parts NAPA style, I'm talking coast to coast action.  Apparently, he stummbled onto the profession after becoming disenchanted with acadamia and subsequently came running back to teaching after less than a year on the road.  Dude is awesome.  He made a cd for the class containing all supplimental reading for the year and saved everyone about $30, while also being increadibly liberal with copyright laws. Double Bonus!!  After debating himself aloud for a few min. the Professor professed a desire to hold informal office hours at Murphy's ( a local bar) despite possible legal/ethical problems posed by holding meetings with students in a bar.  At the beginning of class, he told us we were free to bring any substances that would help keep us alert and then after seeing several sly smilles creep across our collective faces he tagged on the disclaimer, ""That are legal.""  An audible sigh of disapointment reverberated throughout the room.  Not like I do drugs or anything but I heard the chorus to ""Feel Good Hit of The Summer"" roll around in my head. C-c-c-c-c-cocaine!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! If you want all the lyrics for ""Feel Good Hit of the Summer"" go here:  www.thefade.net/lyrics/feelgood The Professor ended the class saying he's more than willing to share trucker stories with us and enticed us with a little preview.  On one of his first days out training, the instructor for the Professor informed him that he sold illegal handguns out of his truck at truck stops.  Kind of makes you want to be a trucker don't it??  My last class on Thur. could have been dreadful, but turned out ok.  Reading about Restoration Period England isn't exactly high on my list of things to do, but graduating is, so I'm in the class.  At first I thought the Professor was going to be a total hipster cause he was rocking the glasses and black bowling shirt.  However, he's a very regular fellow, except for the fact he lived in San Francsisco and moved to these here cornfields. Newsflash buddy, it goes the other way around.",male,23,Student,Taurus,0

554090,1844606,2004-08-02,"Jesus, did Coldplay win enough VMA's this year?  It was a running joke throughout the procession.  It only angered me when they beat out Johnny Cash and Queens of the Stone Age.    Speaking of the Queens, someone at MTV announced that the band showed up and Nick Oliveri was decked out in a dress and smeared make-up.  Words can't describe how much I wanted to see an interview.  Instead, the heads of programming decided to show Sean Paul preforming some reggae-tinged trash and orignally I thought that he should pay royalties to Bob Marley for all those damn Jamacan flags the audience were waving around, but in the end decided that any connection to Bob Marley would be disgraceful.  Moral of the story, Sean Paul is my new favorite hate.  Things didn't get much better when the actual show started.  Oh wait, Brittney made out with Madonna.  It didn't seem contrived at all.  Millions of guys began grabbing their junk and running to the bathroom within moments of said kiss.    Chris Rock killed and it was worth it.  My two favorite lines from the proceeds were (and I'm paraphrasing) ""The Olsen twins are here, and they had to seat R. Kelly up there (points to balcony)"" (I don't think I'll ever get sick of R. Kelly jokes and/or golden shower jokes about R. Kelly) and ""Good Charlotte, more like a mediocre Green Day.""  How the truth hurts.    In the meantime, 50 Cent looked thuggish and was one of the better performers of the evening, not based on singing tallent, but for the fact he emerged from a Pimp Cup (in what could have been a truly Spinal Tap moment).  Althougth I don't think it was his intention, Mr. Cent pulled off the theme of ""pimp"" well by coming from said cup, and having real pimps on stage.  Bravo.   Better yet, Mr. Cent (how awesome is that name?) had Snoop on stage with his ""spiritual advisor"" Don Magic Juan.  For those of you who don't know, Don Magic Juan is one of the most famous Pimps of all time and used to live in Chicago's West Side, where he drove a teal Bentley.  Nothing like keeping a low profile.  But Snoop's best performance wasn't on stage, it came earlier in the evening when he WALKED WOMEN DOWN THE RED CARPET ON LEASHES LIKE DOGS!!!!!!!! (or bitches if you will).  I surprised N.O.W. hasn't had his head.  Then again, he's Snoop.    Overall, the most entertaining part was the red carpet because of the sheer ludicrisness of entrences made by rappers.  OutKast gets an honorable mention for showing up with a flatbed pickup adorned with a stripper pole and strippers.    Overall, I was disapointed, no Johnny Cash and you would think that a building that holds DMX and ODB would result in something scandalous, yet all that occured was a plug for DMx's new album ""Grand Champ"" coming out Sept. 16.  So important that I marked it in my I Book.  As much as I wanted to see Johnny Cash lay waste to all others, I held hope that Metallica could do something cool.  And they still could, it just didn't happen at the show.  After hyping the fact that ""they're gonna do something special at the end"" all we got was a shitty lounge-actesque run through the riffs of ""are you gonna go my way?,"" ""smells like teen spirit,"" ""beat it,"" and ""seven nation army.""  Didn't even get to see the Trujillo dance.  For the record, Audioslave did a cover of ""seven nation army"" at Lolla.  Anywho, I still held hope, but all Metallica did was ""Frantic,"" the best song off the new album, but that's like getting a cold instead of the clap...that analogy sounded better in my head.  Point is, new stuff doesn't rock like ""Creeping Death.""  I suppose my hopes were raised because while watching the VMA's last year, when I remarked to my roomie that the only way the show could get better was if Gn'R played.  They did, and played ""Paradise City.""  Metallica should have taken notes.  My roomate and I speculated that this year could have been better only if Black Sabbath or Rush showed up.  Neither did, hence the disapointment.  Think that's about it. Wait.  Beyonce drank a Pepsi in the middle of her set, ushering an entirely new low in product placement and advertisment.   And Good Charlotte won a Viewer's Choice, once again proving pre-teen girls know how to effectively dial a phone number and lack any taste in music whatso ever.",male,23,Student,Taurus,0

However, the ever present scream of chainsaws kept me from dozing so I wound up sweating up my bed nicely.

How crazy is it to think of things in historical significance?  Last time the Cubs were in the World Series, it had been a few months after the last Atomic Bomb was dropped.  If I were able to control the outcome of the Playoffs, this is what would happen:  -Red Sox defeat Yankees, sending those overprices asses into two hundred years of mediocrity. -Cubs meet the Red Sox in World Series -Cubs win. -Michigan Ave. has a parade that rivals Boys Town...

Guess its cause I'm tired (or at least that's what I'll blame this shocking honesty on).  While I'm on an honesty kick...I'm gonna stop.  Actually I'll just pose a question.  Have you ever had, what I'll refer to as a ""sex flashback.""  Doesn't necessarily have to be sex, but somesort of intimate thing, where BAM out of the blue, you get a sudden rush of all sensations of that moment, taste, smell, texture the whole nine yards?  Happens at least once a month if not more.  As if my classes weren't boring enough, my senses decide to remind me of a better time, a better place and I'm stuck.  grrrr.  Time for bed.  More dreams to follow.  The one that caught my attention today was multifacited in the fact that I was combining many locals.    At one point I was in Highwood, motoring back from the Hoagie Hut on the chair I am currently sitting on, typing this garbage.  I was heading to Lake Bluff.  When I got there, I entered a friends house, a kid that goes to school here.  I haven't been to his house in about a solid decade.  I walked up his stairs into his room and found out that another friend/roommate was injured.  I came to my apartment, which was more like a loft and walked next door to find my real roommate's ex-gf hanging out with one of my ex-gf.  My ex was clothed, or at least I thought she was because as I went over to comfort her, (apparently she had broken up with her perpetually stoned boyfriend) I realized she was wearing a thong.  Someone else pointed this out and she ran out the door and switched into her yellow colored strawberry adorned pajama pants.  I looked into her face and it was so vivid I couldn't believe it was a dream. K, come to think of it, in regards to scenes involving sleeping, I do use one ex girlfriend fairly extensively as the template for conversations.  Cause its all I know.  And they say you should write what you know about.  So I guess my great novel on Alaskan Moose hunting will not be written this year.  Now its really time for bed, where I'll have a thousand good story ideas run through before I finally succumb to sleep and will be awoken by the froterism fan club downstairs deciding that if they can't be bumping bumpin to techno, they'd rather be banging doors so they can at least feel a beat.",male,23,Student,Taurus,0
554101,1844606,2004-08-02,"Following up on that post (which now that I think of it will appear before the previous post), I always try to stay away from writing about relationships because I don't want to be known as ""that guy/ that girl"" that uses his life straight up for ""stories"" that are supposed to be ""fictional"", but really wind up being a slick re-hash of previous events.    What I do to offset this problem is that I put a little bit of myself into every character, that way I don't identify fully with anyone in particular.  What I really want to do with this story is slam the shit out of all the kids in the class.  It could be so good.  Premise of the story is the narrator is a creative writing teacher and then I subtley dig at all the types of writing I hate.  Such as:  -using stories as a form of therapy.  There are people working hard for degrees in Psychology.  Go pay these people because I, as an Eng. and Rhet. Major, am not being compensated for listening to your trivial little problems about when your favorite pony died when you were a small child. -I'll admit I'm guilty of this one.  I have written, to my count, at least two full stories about relationships I've been in.  The difference/justification is this: I had not been seeing/interested in the person for a max. of 6 months.  This allows perspective, and also lets me write a  story  as apposed to a blow by blow account of he said she said, which let me tell you, can drag on and on.   -People who write about themselves and then  don't   change the name of the protagonist.  Seriously people, if you're going to make me spend time reading and critiquing something, at least make the effort to put a different frickin name down on the page.  My other problem with this inability to not name characters is that it completely ruins the whole ""author is not narrator"" idea that has been ingrained in my brain since I entered college.  It lessons the impact of the story and ultimately makes it come off as juvinial.  If that's what you want, keep it in your journal.  -Don't rant (this is my PoMo ironical point) -Don't write about art, or something related to aesthetic pleasure.  You come off sounding pretentious and if I wanted to look at a painting, I would.  I don't want to read about still lifes. -I'm guilty of this one hard core.  Don't referrence music just because it has sentimental value to you as the author.  It will not have the same impact on you as it does for the reader, thus the author looses control over what he/she is writing. -if you have a crush on someone in the class, tell them, don't write a subtle story about it Shakespeare. -Along the same lines, don't use the stories as a way to pick up women by acting emo.  (I'm kind of guilty of this).  Cause I really want to write my seminal piece ""misogyny rules""  and then do a completely scathing piece on women and their inconsistances.  My second book would be ""Male Assholes.""  Think of it as a compainon piece. -Don't write shit, seems simple, but I'm sick of it -If you're gonna be super critical, you better be able to back it up, cause there ain't nothing worse than someone thinking they are God's greatest gift and then they constantly turn in subpar work.

Wish I was there to celebrate.  Its one of those deals where the friendship seemed more solid than it really was, and in typical slapnutz fashion, I misread it all, said things I shouldn't have said and sometime last March it got to the point where I realized it wasn't worth the time or effort to maintain it all.  But sometimes you wonder.  How things are going, what's new.  But the effort of asking overrides ego.  A year ago today I had been living in this apartment for about 2 and a half weeks.  I knew her birthday was coming up and being in the lowly position of ""cute friend"" was handcuffed by the possiblities of a gift.  Hours were spent in the most unmasculine of stores looking for the ""perfect card.""  After narrowing the choices to something non-mushy and somewhat sly, I returned home and showed my roommate the choices.  They were, in his words, decidedly weak.  Back to Hallmark I went and wound up getting something different.  But ah, what should the gift be?  I wrote a quick note, hyping my culinary abilities.  Quick isn't the best word, considering five drafts were written for a three line note.    Her birthday was upon us.  I went to a meeting after classes and called later on.  Sweat dripped from the point of my nose and hit the phone.  This time it wasn't nerves, but the heat.  I walked over to her place an hour later to drop off the card, and her ""guy friend"" was there.  Talking was kept at a premium.  I claimed work had to be done and made a quick exit.  I hadn't seen her in two weeks but it felt longer.  Talking on the phone was a mixed blessing of comfort combined with an ache of not seeing her.    A few days later on the phone, she talked about new jobs and new guys she was scopeing.  If I knew better, or took off my blinders, I would have seen it all.  But I didn't.  Jealousy, anxiety and a slight sense of desperation shook me.  Beer could not calm me and I found myself lying awake, having to write to get this off my chest.  The beginnings of a great letter never sent lay on the back page of a discarded notebook.  Its themes all too framiliar.  I knew I was in trouble because I now admitted I cared.

554136,1844606,2004-08-02,"Hello readers.  A warning to start off tonight's journal.  I am intoxicated.  Blame Coors Light and my lack of will power.  Admittedly, before I really start in on this stuff, I know its going to be all over the place.  The tips of my fingers feel numb, yet I'm able to type well enough.    Here's the crux of it all.  Yes, once again, in what feels like a never ending cycle of disapointment (some hyperbolie (sp?)) I have once again found out that a girl I've been somewhat interested in, is in fact, interested in someone else.  And as always, I got to meet the guy face to face.  He seems decent enough, so long as you discount the fact that HE IS A TEACHING ASSISTANT IN ONE OF HER CLASSES.  Getting a Doctorite in Communications...interesting.  If I wasn't an English major maybe I'd have some moral or intellectual superiority to judge him on.  But I don't.  I'm just way bummed. Back to negative square one.  I've got nothing except self doubt, but that isn't very fun to cuddle with late at night.    Can't blame the girl, she's super sweet and if she digs this guy so be it.  Things probably wouldn't have worked anyways.   I feel as though I'm lying to people if I don't tell them the truth about my stomach stuff, yet if I do tell them, I fear they'd never want to be around me, especially in a romantic sense.  When the question is posed if I think that someone would be incapable of loving me cause of what I've got, my knee jerk reaction is, ""No, of course not"" because as that question stands, I don't believe it.  But when I think of all the subtle, latent and underlying issues of everything, it becomes readily apparent that I don't believe I can be loved, and moreover that its going to take an extrodinarily compassionate and understanding woman to understand.  I don't want to resign myself to singlehood, cause I don't dig it, but I don't think anyone could handle everything that I really am.  I don't even know what I want.  But I do know I don't want to sell myself short on a one night deal or something short term.  In addition, I also know I feel uncomfortable in any situation when I think there is the possibility of something romantic, and the lack of self confidence I have is utterly astounding.  When I was dumped or rejected in the past, one of the first thoughts I'd get was, ""Their loss""  As of late, I haven't felt that and find it tougher to believe in as the days go by.    Random note:  To add to the perfection of misery, as I was slowly, drunkenly, realizing that she was crazy for this other guy, as her roommate told me as I waited for beer, ""Hummer"" by the Pumpkins came on and I was instantly transported to another place.  Not better, but actually worse.  ""Hummer"" is off of Siamese Dream and I listened to that album incesently freshman year, while as I look back on it now, I was fooling myself with the illusion rather than reality of a relationship.  Anyways, this is rambling a bit more than my usual taste, but ""Hummer"" always seemed to play as I was walking back from the Undergrad library and I would look to the sky, see the sun smiling back at me and I would get goosebumps thinking about the way the end of the solo dovetailed into Billy's exclamation of ""I love you.""  Those lines echoed and I always thought of the same girl.  And now, I can't stand to seeslashtalk to the girl that I once pictured and sadly, I think whatever window of oppritunity I had with Miss ""E"" has gone by the wayside.  Thought she did want me to call her tomorrow about going around as Sid and Nancy.  We'll see.  I just miss (but is miss the right word if no one was ever there in the first place) having solid female friends to lean on when I was feeling emotional/vulnerable.   I have ""Say Anything"" here at the apartment and I would  really love to be able to just snuggle up with someone special, (miss ""e"" perhaps) watch it and for 2 hours feel something special.  The closest I've come in the past few months was some incidental contact from a girl in my ice skating class whose leg brushed up against mine as she skidded into place against the boards.  Her voice was soft and she apologized for bumping into me, and I said it was no big deal.  Her hair is light autumn brown, curly (doesn't that always seem to be the case) and her eyes are very particular and remind me of Kate Hudson...damn it why do the girls I see, and are attracted to fall into distinct catagories?  Well, children, this drunken rambling looks to be losing its head of steam.

We decided to head to downtown, to get far from the post-parade stampeed to cars to our favorite place.  Though it was essentially a hot dog stand situated inside the first floor of a converted teniment, the cobblestone street, small dimensions and quaint heart back shaped metal chairs gave it the feel of something European.  The gold leaf lettering of Left Bank situated between an oversized hot dog didn't hurt either.  The old man's smile was geniune whether it was your first trip in, or if he had seen you grow up before his eyes.  The kid in front of me ordered, and when he moved over to pay, began to dig frantically in his pockets for the extra few dollars.  He was a few bucks short.  I started to paw through my pockets hoping to find some change, but Mr. P cut everything short announcing, ""Don't worry about it, just take it.""  The sandy haired kid promised he'd come back in an hour with the rest of it, but again his offer was rebuffed with a simple ""Just enjoy.""  He moved off with his tray as Mr. P finished ringing up the sale, called out his characteristic ""What can I do for ya?"" and then had a glimmer of recognition and a smile came across his face ""If it isn't Mr. Scott.  How are you my boy?""  Tangent:  He had an old school work ethic and charm to match.  I suppose it came from him owning the place and being around so long, no one could remember a time when he wasn't there.  He was around before fast food and even thought a health conciousness had cut into his business in the past few years, most people would agree it was his charm and cheese dogs that kept people coming back.  Busy days were few and far between in recent times, but on those rare occations when all the seats were filled, the most valued customers got to sit in the back room.

Things are pretty open ended as they stand right now, but I kind of like the poetic vibe I've got (or at least I think I do).  Sandals rhythmically slapping against heals, I follow her down the path.  Weather beaten logs act as steps and in the distance I hear waves crashing and can see the tops of white caps in the distance.  We settle in at our normal spot. The bluffs look like mirror images of the waves, water substituted for sand. Green grass peaks over the top like wisps of hair of a baby. A cove dips into the lake and sunbathers are stretched out as if they are in an amphitheater.  For the most part we are alone except for giggling kids a ways away. Adventurous kids, some who can't read the warning signs, and those who chose to ignore, climb on a man made isthmus of jagged rocks leading out into the waves. Neurotic mothers wave their hands in a helpless sort of way and scream for their child to come back in safely. The kids milk the situation and pretend to slip on the rocks, incensing the mothers and it draws a chorus of giggles from the co-conspirators who are wrapped up in challenging the incoming waves with broad motions with their hands.  Shrieks of children alert all to incoming waves and as they crash against the rocks. As the water retreats underneath the rocks, a slow slurping sucking noise is made sounding much like a belly swollen from drinking too much pop. I used to be one of those kids out there, but freedom ainât what it used to be. * * * The 4th of July used to be about the parades, the spectacle of deafening fire trucks, squad cars and marching bands, water guns, a hammock in a tree and a trampoline",male,23,Student,Taurus,0

Everytime I'm out watching tv later in the evening, I feel the couch vibrate from bass and then I'm chronically woken up and have trouble falling back asleep.  School and life are enough to deal with, I don't need to be tired as well.  On the brightside, I can't wait for Thanksgiving break...I'm going to try and leave here Wed. cause, lets face it, I think I can miss some classes.  My only obsticle is getting my next story done for Rhet class.  Nothing has been written but I'm thinking of doing a big farce on the judicial system with some guy being put on trial for being a romantic.  Opening scene would be overly dramatic, possibly even like Law and Order, and then they read the charge ""Being a romantic in the first degree""  Character then says ""damn""  I also plan on constructing a scene in which a family dog gets up on the stand, and speaks in lyrical verse and basically says that he walked in on these characters having sex and he licked their feet.  A character witness of sorts...  As for grades, they are looking better.  I'm not quite sure how this system works, but by my English Major math skills, it looks like with Extra Credit, I have something like a 101% on my last psych exam-effectively taking me out of the ""C"" dog house for the class. That was a reference to a grade, not some lame ass nickname...if you call me ""C"" dog, expect a Suge-style drive by.  I also did very well on my Sex test, missing only one question.  This weekend I have to write a paper on Why Prostitution should be legal and find ""academic"" sources.  There goes my interview the corner workers method.  Research for 9-11 the comic book is coming along I guess.  I went to the Comm. library the other day and checked out 15 books on comics, theory and the history of comics.  I walked up and the girl working looked at the stack with amazement.  I commented it was research.  Then she saw the titles and gave me a look.  I tried to explain, she didn't get the concept of Spiegleman's 9-11.    Professor and I are thinking about having a visual display to go along with my final thesis at the end of the year. I'm all for it.  I would love to shock and offend the hell out of the people down here.  And maybe a few will think, and question.  And I will have won.

554190,1844606,2004-08-02,"This evening, I watched two episodes of ""Queer Eye"" and though I don't have much ground to speak on behalf gay men cause I'm straight, but I would think some gay guys would have issues with the way they are being represented.  First, a distinction that comes from a gay friend of a friend.  The gay guy hates ""fags"" or his own derogitory term for gay guys who are so flamboyant that they are almost a characture of gay men.  But he enjoys gay guys, basically regular old people who happen to be gay.  I would think that the fashion guy on Queer Eye would raise some red flags in the queer community because he is so flamboyant and constantly makes referrences to gay sex-as though that's the only thing that he cares about.  And that maybe, but its dangerious to have this guy so front and center because it merely perpetrates the myth that's all gay guys thing about.  I don't know, maybe I'm wrong.  Maybe a large part of gay culture is being different and flaunting their sexuality.  Its just from what I see coming across on the screen, the actions further myths and pigeonhole gay men as being funny, into clothes and sex.  Why can't there be just a regular gay guy on?  Like the food guy?  He seems pretty regular and decent and doesn't have to constantly announce his choice of sexuality.  I guess its different because I would be a part of the majority and don't think that I have to use my sexuality necessarily to define my personality, but for gay men or women in general, that is the big difference and in part is what gives them a sense of community.  I realize that I don't have much footing for what is written, but it just seems that while on the one hand it seems great that this show is enjoying so much success, it may ultimately backfire, for the American populous is going to see distinct stereotypes from a few individuals and jump to conclusions.

554272,1844606,2004-08-02,"Yes, I gave into the lust I have for new  good  music and found Wilco's ""A Ghost is Born"" online.  Early attempts were thwarted by a German website and an inability to download the program.  Then, as if the heavens opened, at 3:30am last night, an English version of the page appeared and an hour later I had Tweedy's new opus.  I've listened to the album about 6 times through today and am currently enjoying it via burned CD.  People on various boards have called it a logical progression from YHF but I would argue that it reminds me more of ""Loose Fur"" (and then some hipster would say that was an off shoot of YHF...and at that point I would punch his latte drinking mug).  Ambient noise and fuzzy guitar leads dominate ""Ghost"" and while it proves an interesting listen, Wilco is at its best when putting aside the atmospheric gimmics and gets down to the core of the songs.  ""Late Greats"" and ""Hummingbirds"" stand out as two shining examples of a band playing together with tasteful overdubs.  The 9 min. of noise on ""Less Than You Think"" follows in the vein of ""Reservations"" from YHF with less musicality.  ""Wishful Thinking"" stands as a great synthasis of what the band can do with atmospherics, a regular band mix and moving down to sparse parts.     At times the mix is agitating (though most likely on purpose) as in ""At Least That's What You Said"" as the beginning is barely audible until turning up the volume, and then being blasted by drums.  These sorts of experiments with mix detract from the song(s) as a whole, though would probably sound fantastic live.      For all the minor detractors listed, this is a phenominal album on first (or sixth) listen and stands perched as an album that grows on a listener with time.  Jeff Tweedy's voice cuts through the songs in a clarity not yet heard on any Wilco album and Stirrat's basslines demand attention as an intigral part of all songs.  As for the drums, Kotche's presence is not as up front in YHF, but still solid and dependable as ever.  An attempt to follow up an album the likes of YHF would be nearly impossible for any other band, but Wilco, a band always known for taking chances and changing on every album, is equal to the task and will not disapoint hardcore fans and novices alike.",male,23,Student,Taurus,0

Self confidence, never had a ton, and after SDavenpo's words on my thesis pretty much burned up whatever was left in regards to editing...But every morning I wake up thinking things wouldn't be so bad.  There are some definate positives.  I know this community and can get around pretty well, as opposed to Chi. where if I'm feeling sick I would have to contend with riding the EL to get things done.  Plus, I'm guessing that getting a grand as a paycheck every two weeks wouldn't be too shabby.  But can it buy happiness?  I don't know.  I'm pretty sure I could do the job, but I'd most likely make it way more stressful than need be. Cause I like to be perfect and going line by line looking for grammatical things that may or maynot be there is really disconcerning.  And I'm starting to get these anxiety panic freakouts while going over this test...Probably cause I know there is a lot riding on it but, Jesus I can't calm down. Its the most intense mix of isolation, stir craziness, bordom, and wanting my life to get on with it I've ever experienced.  And I've already got two consecutive summers under my belt of this feeling.  Plus feeling sick don't help much.  God damn this place.  I just think maybe there is a limit of living in this town for four years for a reason.  Uggggggggghhhhhh.  Time to sleep for 10 hours and feel exausted the entire day.

I would get to be creative at some level.  But ethics might be sketchy.  But I could probably deal with it if I was in LA.  A friend advised in an email that I should just move to LA and find a job when out there.  It's tempting but considering I don't ever deal well with change and uncertainty, it probably won't happen.  Though I would at least have an assemblance of a network of friends in LA with a certain Sliozi.  Sad to say that after 4 years of school, I have two or three aquatances and I haven't hung out with anyone in the three weeks I've spent down here over the summer.  But the question comes down to whether I continue to repeat past mistakes and pass on the sure thing in front of me or wait hoping something else will come up.  I'm leaning towards being conservative and telling myself that in three years I can go anywhere I want.  I half believe it.  Cause by then I'll probably be tied down and unable to move to Cali, learn to surf and find an awesome lady.

Obsessive fans are a lot like overprotective mothers; they don't want to share their loved one with anyone.  Both bands and children alike have to grow and by the time the band grows out of adolescence (or playing clubs) fans begin to cry foul.  Fans and parents need to learn to accept change.  Yes it sucks that you can't score tickets for when the band does do an one off club show or that your child moves away, but know that these changes lead to bigger success.  Ultimately, the early days of clubs or childhood, and the memories that accompany them will mean so much more the further the band or child moves on in life.    idea for book.

Not that I'm a big stickler for PC stuff, but after Fez on That 70's show, I think it has all been played out. Two, it was positively brilliant to make a film about a dork and the preppy kids in high school. Never been done before or better. BRILLIANT. Three, there is a thing called ""plot"" and generally some ""character development"" in stories and movies. Both were lacking. Finally, relying on a kid's goofy looks for laughs for a full length movie gets old. I will also say that the viewing was somewhat spoiled by North Shore copycat mallrats decked in A&F with glowing cellphones and fake tans.   Oh yeah, I predict, if it hasn't happened already, that this will be the most quoted (rather misquoted) film for the next, let's say, 3 months.

554313,1844606,2004-08-02,"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOMMMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH  I'm pretty psyched about the trade.  I like both Boston and Cubs, but speaking from a Boston fan, jesus, what the hell were you thinking?  First, way to go with alienating an All-Star and fucking the situation (""trading"" for A-Rod) up so badly that you trade him for a couple of sub .250 hitters and some minor leagures.  In regards to Theo Epstien, how exactly is the problem ""fixed"" as you put it?  Defense might be better and you may have rid yourself of a ""problem"" by getting rid of Nomar, but you could have at least gotten equal value for him.  But maybe something is better than nothing.  If Nomar was slighted by your team President, GM, and sometimes 1B, maybe he had a right to be displeased. Rumor has it, Nomar was getting so fed up in Beantown that he considered sitting for 3 weeks while recouping from his achilles problem.  Nomar might be showing signs of slowing down after missing most of a season a few years ago with a broken wrist and is now hobbled by an achilles,  but no matter how you slice it, he is a massive upgrade over Gonzo.  On the other side, as of now, the trade can only be seen as an absolute steal.  Who knows what the prospects the Cubs gave away will become, or even if Nomar will stay past Oct (all indications are he would like to) but unless Beltran turns into the second coming of Dontrell Willis or any number of other Cubs pitching prospects that have been shipped away in recient years, this looks pretty solid.   Lets face it, Bartman was not the only reason the Cubs blew game 6 last year.  Anyone remember the ole job Gonzo pulled?  The man that was hearlded for his defensive prowless.  Yeah.  Garciaparra's bat at the top or middle of the Cubs lineup will give it some much needed consistancy and baserunners, and his defense is still solid.  If Sammy wasn't a puss he'd accecpt moving to the 5th or 6th slot in the line up and let players who hit move up and have him see better pitches.  He should also realize he's not putting the ball in play and be man enough to ask for help with his swing cause it ain't working.  More middle relief for the Cubs would have been nice, but the possibility of a waiver trade is there for the next month or so and everyone is coming back from injuries.  Once Wood and Prior are able to go 6 or 7 solid innings, the bullpen will get some help as well.  That being said, the closer job is still very loose, but I'm glad the Cubs didn't go after Urbina or Jose Mesa because neither have been consistantly reliable in the past two years.   That's my take on baseball.    PS   Moving out in 90 heat sucks massively.",male,23,Student,Taurus,0

600488,4095054,2004-07-31,"so ive spent the day researching and what not,  ive found my points target is 28 which is fine! ive done that before i can do it again.  along with that there are 35flexpts to use over the week... in a way i hate having the 'yay i can eat more' feeling but they are kind of nice to have around in case im in a restaurant and am nto sure of the total pts of a dish. anyway! i have a qestion about activity points... if anyone might be able to answer it (not sure if anyone reads this LOL so i might figure things out on my own eventually) the most exercise i will do is:  30min walk OR bike once a day.  and about 3 days a week doing strength training.  from time to time i'll pop in a video or do some floor exercises  but overal what is the rule about calculating activity points? is it basically 100cals of exercise = 2 activity points?  as it is with the food?  im not quite sure but anyway i'll do some more research :) so, i guess i will start with seeing how many pts ive eaten! im still trying my best to learn portioning as well... thats been a big problem for my lazy ass. always!  breakfast: 1 apple & 1 glass of cranberry juice = 2.5pts lunch: 1 slice of bread with 2 slices of turkey = 2pts snack: 1 glass of drink yoghurt = 1.5pts dinner: small steak (about 130g?)  100g oven fries with vinegar &salt, spinach salad with apple & 2 tbsp honey apple vinaigarette.   hmmmm......   thats 4pts for the fries, 0 for vinegar & salt... 0 for spinach, 2 for the vinaigrette, 0.5 for the apple... aaanndddd  i think about 3 for the small steak!  so  =  9.5pts for dinner movie snack:  4 oreos = 4pts 1 glass skim milk=1pt   6 cups airpopped popcorn = 2.5pt  1 tbsp butter = 3pt. seasoning = 0  caffeine free diet coke = 0  there. i had 24.5  thats too far under....   maybe i could make extra popcorn?? makes it 26pts. hmmmm 2 extra.  oh! i'll have a kiwi  for 1pt  aanndddd ummm that makes it 27! thats pretty damn close, not bad for a first day!  although since i only have popcorn  like twice a week and only have movie snacks once a week i'll have to eat A LOT of fruit and such during the week to make up those extra points! no worries though it will all work out! im feeling confident it will... not overly confident that always ended in disaster in the past but im doing alright! now off to grill that steak!  steak au poivre! easypeasy :)",female,23,indUnk,Gemini,1
600489,4095054,2004-07-31,"well, here we are again.  WW for the third and final time, the only plan ive found that i can do forever & actually works for my situation. i would love to use the flexpoints plan but its not available here so i will do what i can to the best of my understanding of flexpoints! last time i did this was with winning points and i lost about 20lb (i had more than that to lose but those 20lb took me a whole year so lets not get into that)  im at 104.5kg (230lb - 16.5st?) while just a week ago i was 227 (103kg - 16st) 3lb in 1 week, surely ive gained more than that in the past but its still a shock from time to time :)  lets see. stats. im 23, 230lb, 5'7"" although i think ive shrunken to 5'5!! no no, lets keep it at 5'7.  i know nothing about how to make these blogs my own, put sidebars in & add links and all those fun things that everyone in the universe seems to be able to do... which is ok, im no computer genius. im married to one but i am in no way computer savvy. i have no kids & plan to keep it that way, my cats are my babies & eventually my dogs will be too!  the first time i went on WW was in 2000, i weighed 198lb which i got too by going on herbalife when i was 187lb. i used to be 150lb -- actually not too long ago, 5 years actually. then after high school i moved on and got a job in a movie theatre. MISTAKE. gained 30lb there, no exercise, cheap theatre food, late night drinks... i also smoked like a chimney. sometimes 2 packs a day ( i quit jan 2, 2002) so i started popping diet pills -- knew nothing about nutrition, what good eating was about, so it was a downhill process. the second time i went on WW was 2002... i got the cd rom, its all in dutch & the dutch systems are different, i dont like it as much.  so here we are today! 80lb to go! well 75, i will see how i feel at 155 then if i choose to, will go on to 150.  who knows, maybe i will bow down to society and push myself to 125lb?? NAH screw them, they can keep their ideals. ive always been confident & secure in my own flesh, even now. i just dont like the bigger clothes. theres nothing cute & sassy here like old navy or lane bryant or anything along those lines (i am Canadian living in The Netherlands) and of course Europe is known for fashion... if you are 8 feet tall and 100lb. i find the occasional cute thing which i buy in every colour & jeans have never been a problem. but i long for fashion that doesnt come in my size. amongst other things, i want to be healthy again! well i wasnt fit at 150lb so that will be different this time around. i want to ski with ease, burning lungs are NOT my friend.  anyway, thats enough blabbing for 1 post, i need to get on with the program! get things sorted & started. flex points. do share... everything you can. tips, suggestions. anything, im like a sponge, i suck up information! without the smelly spongy thing those sponges have going on :)",female,23,indUnk,Gemini,1
600490,4095054,2004-08-20,"im no perfect weight watcher, i dont know many people who are... everyone has their ups and downs but ultimately we all strive for our goals in the end despite the obstacles that pop up along the way. now maybe i havent quite understood the whole flexpoint thing...  maybe someone can help me out here? my pt target being 28  and having 35 Fpts for the week which means on average 5 per day to play with IF its necessary. is it that IF that im getting wrong? are those points just mostly for decoration and educated guesses when it comes to dishes weve never encountered before? if we do in fact eat all 35 of those points through the week does that mean we maintain? gain? i was sure that even with the extras a loss must still happen.... otherwise why would they come up with a plan like this?  anyway,  why does this happen... you all know what im talking about, you sit down in the morning with your breaky and write out a meal plan for the day and vow to stick to it letter for letter and it might be 2 or 3 points under your target? well come evening time you say 'well i still have a couple pts left' so you go on to eat them and a few more?! what is this about? is this just my PMS madness? it happened almost everyday this week! (my week starts at weigh in sat. morning- ) even last night. i said ok i will not eat anything after this salmon dinner because i wont need it! i started to get antsy and needing something, its almost like my body was screaming for protein again -- its a common occurrance come this time of the month. so i had some bread with peanut butter - 12 points worth! WHY is peanut butter so high? jeez. anyway, then later on i had some plain lowfat yoghurt with a small handfull of mixed nuts & dried fruits. ok sometimes i feel this behaviour justified because 1- im in the week up to my period. 2- im not bingeing on chocolate, chips, fries, fatty meats, take outs, candies etcetcetc. its just regular healthy food. of course, that doesnt change the fact i take in more than i PLAN on taking in. i planned on 23pts (ok, still under my 28 target but i felt it ok because i had some flexpoints the night before) yet ended up eating 33.5 which is 5.5 of my Fpts right there.  well, i suppose only the scale will tell the truth and that will be saturday morning. im still strangely positive about the whole thing despite feeling bloated and the beginning twinge of cramps. i just feel a wee bit lighter... albeit bloated and fat ... but lighter nonetheless.  *sigh* whats a woman to do?  oh! i did get 804 steps yesterday... nothing close to my former glory of 1500 but im working on it :)  im still proud of my progress thats for sure!",female,23,indUnk,Gemini,1
600491,4095054,2004-08-19,"so yesterday i mentioned some differences ive noticed between the flexplan and the dutch plan (points plus) hummus is 1 of my favourite things, when i make it i keep it smooth, spicy & very garlicky. minimal added points. i add a couple TBSP of plain lowfat yoghurt, lemon juice, 5+ cloves of garlic, cayenne pepper & a squiggle of sesame oil because i cant find tahini here. so in all thats 1.5pt added to the chickpeas. i grabbed a can of chickpeas out of the pantry and entered the values. cals, fat, fibre. before i added the fibre into my flexpoints calculator it was 7pts (which would make just over 1cup of hummus) but low and behold because of the high fibre content (14+g per can) i ended up with 4points. so add the extras and i have a 5.5pt lunch with a ton of raw veggies which fills me up for 5+ hours im in such ecstasy right now over this that i cant even sit still. i was counting it as 4pt before and then after reaslising a whole can went into the hummus that i thought i would never be able to eat it anymore because the point value would be too high YAY FOR FLEXPOINTS! im so thrilled its only 5.5pts for a lunch thats SO filling and so incredibly healthy -- garlic is the best thing in the world, next to chocolate but of course chocolate & chickpease doesnt sound overly appetizing :) so! i shall go on to eat at least 2 days of hummus per week becuase 1- its my favourite and 2- a ton of garlic means never being sick. and i hate being sick. i was sick A LOT in high school. in 2003-today i was sick for a grand total of 3 days. thank you healthy food! i do love you!  oh, another fantabulous issue... i not only reached, but exceeded my step goal! i made 1,503 steps yesterday! thats 0.75km... and i shook the damn thing to see how far i needed to get to reach 1km and it was 2000 steps. still a ways off then but i now know that jumping around while i prepare meals & marching -- especially after drinking a lot--back and forth from the bathroom to the living room certainly helps! im very pleased with this, yes indeedy.  so todays menu goes as follows  breakfast: fruit'fibre, all bran plus & skim milk = 3pts lunch: tomato toast (thick slices of tomato on 2 slices toast sprinkled with salt & pepper), tea with honey, apple = 3.5pts snack: 1 boiled egg on toast = 3pts snack: plain lowfat yoghurt, honey & 1 chopped nectarine mixed in = 2.5pts dinner: 1 salmon filet baked with tomato sauce & grated parmesan, veggie salad with vinaigrette = 9pts snack: 1/2glass cranberry juice, celery - 1 stalk with tbsp pb. 1 stalk with tbsp philly light = 4pts  total: 23pts .. i think this is alright because ive used 11.5 flexpoints already this week, its good to find a balance from time to time especially since the more flexpoints i use the less weight i seem to lose. lets just go on that theory for now :)  im hoping autumn is on its way, i do miss the beautiful colours and crisp cool air... i long to be breathing it in, walking through the forest without the threat of a bazillion bugs & scorching sun. oh how i long for autumn... winter... i wonder what we are doing for our anniversary this year. last year we went away for our anniversary (dec. 20) and spent the x-mas week in a cottage. it was nice but i dont think we will be able to afford that this year since our main goal is saving to move back to Canada a.s.a.p. i do miss my Island, i do i do (Vancouver island -- i do lurrrrve Vancouver yesyesyes its the bestbestbest) LOL anyway.... off to make lunch before i get so hungry i eat one of the cats.",female,23,indUnk,Gemini,1
600492,4095054,2004-08-18,"i know that this is the day i step on the scale to decide what to change depending on which way the number has headed BUT ive also decided its not really necessary anymore.  Maybe it's because i stepped on this morning to see a +400g problem or maybe its because ive been thinking about this for a couple days and it honestly seems unnecessary? maybe its a bit of both!  Either way im +400g despite staying in my points everyday like last week. last night i did eat 7.5FP but i should still be losing even if i get all 35 in the week right? anyway, somethings not right and i decided to do some research, this is what i found.  1. the dutch program says 1 pizza is 14pts. the american says 1/2 pizza for 16pts  2. the dutch program says unlimited potatoes for 2pts. the american says 2pts per potato. 3. the dutch program says fruit is 0pts (except bananas, grapes, plums etc. for about 1pt each, plums are 3 for 1pt) the american says 1pt per fruit period, 2 for bananas. 4. the dutch says 4pt for 1cup hummus. the american says 4pt for 1 cup CHICKPEAS (1 cup of hummus can be 1 whole can of chickpeas) 5. the dutch says 11 pts for 1 restaurant portion of grilled spare ribs.  the american says 8pts for 4 single ribs. 6. the dutch says 1 muffin is 4pts.  i dont know how many they are in flexpoints, i havent finished researching yet.  so, the list goes on but you see i have to switch my thinking to the american flexpoints completely... the whole year the dutch program has been ingrained in me -- which wont be easy to change-- could be causing me problems on my new plan. considering i didnt lose more than 20lb on the dutch plan anyway.. its a wonder how any of the dutch people lose weight. well of course they never need to lose more than 20-30lbs anyway so its probably not a huge issue for them. i need to go home to Vancouver and everything will be perfect, i dont want to be here anymore everything is WRONG! hehe i just need to go. period. Marcel has said if i can secure a job then he would let me go... i suppose i can try to do that, i did all the calculations for living expenses & saving for a house etc. and i would need to make about 500$ per week (canadian) to get where i want to be... it shouldnt be overly difficult to find except for the fact that i have no training, no experience and no degrees. im a grade 13 grad and thats about as far as it goes. im open to any training programs of course i just dont know what i want yet. what 23 year old does. unless they are freaks like my husband whos known what hes wanted since he was 7 yrs old.  anyway, rant done. im going to REALLY go for 1,000 steps today! wish me luck. and 28pts, no exceeding. if i get a horrible pms craving to eat a loaf of bread in 1 sitting i will chug bottle after bottle of water until im completely water logged and have to roll myself to the bathroom :) i suppose i wont be losing 5lb this week to reach my first goal but i WILL lose those 5lb eventually, just not on the date that i planned. does anything ever go to plan anyway?? please, if someone out there has met EVERY single goal ON the exact date they planned it then kept it off forever, do message me! id love to hear your story because you are not even remotely normal and im all for meeting people whove accomplished awesome feats of absolute perfection.",female,23,indUnk,Gemini,1

600495,4095054,2004-08-15,"its good to plan ahead.  yesterday i sat down and wrote daily meal plans for today, monday & tuesday.  tuesday i will carry on with the rest of the week. its hard to believe im actually going to start exercising...  i honestly despise it but im in lust with how it makes me feel after im finished. getting going is usually my greatest battle and hopefully iwth this pedometer it will help encourage me.  im still figuring out out hte best sensitivity because it either works too well and i end up with more steps than i took or not sensitive so i end up wiht say 11 steps when ive taken 25.   so its still a work in progress. right now im going to enjoy my casual sunday by taking a looooong hot shower, reading outside on the balcony then later in the evening very possibly going for a walk!  im going to list my food plan for the day because i feel like it :)  breakfast: 2 slices of toast with jam, 1 glass cranberry juice, cup of coffee with milk & sugar = 6pts snack: glass of skim milk with nesquick = 2pts lunch: tuna sarnie (1/2cup tuna, tbsp plain lowfat yoghurt, diced pickles on 2 slices toast) = 6pts snack: glass of skim milk with nesquick = 2pts dinner: subway 6"" turkey on whole wheat with all veggies, extra jalapenos, no sauce. 1 oatmeal raisin cookie,  1 can diet coke = 10pts (5.5for sub,  4.5 for cookie)  snack: glass skim milk with nesquick = 2pts  total: 28pts!  not normally as much fruit as i would like but 1 glass of cranberry juice counts as 2 servings of fruit so i guess its not too bad.   and i got 3 glass of milk! WOOHOO!   oh, if anyones wondering why i put nesquick in my milk its because i was raised on powdered milk and forced to drink it even though i hated it (gagged my way through at least 1 glass everyday -- thanks a bundle ex-stepfather)  so since then ive absolutely hated the taste of ALL milk and can only drink it with a small spoonfull of chocolate powder, and even then i have to chug it!  i hate milk but i hate the thought of brittle bones more so i do my best and if that means using 3extra points per day just for 1 small spoonfull of nesquick per glass (3 glasses per day)  then so be it :)",female,23,indUnk,Gemini,1
600496,4095054,2004-08-14,"i love spiffy new toys, dont you? well ive been thinking of ways to get exercise into my day and a pedometer always seemed like an excellent way for a couch potato like myself... so, i did some research and decided on the omron fit bug pro. well, out to the store lalala no omron! ok, so M. decided the next best thing would be the oregon scientific PE316PM and i love it... its small & kidney shaped, a funky turqiois colour, it has pulse control (a little strap thingy you stick your finger in, it takes your pulse, clever little thing) and as long as you find the right sensitivity for you it can be quite accurate -- im still trying to figure that out... on the least sensitive i can dance in my chair as i usually do and it doesnt seem to have too much effect on the little thing! the only really sucky thing is how hard it is to open, the grated button has made my thunb raw & red but other than that i have zero complaints! its so small and light i dont even know its there. it doesnt fall off when i go to the bathroom & it has everything from distance travelled, steps travelled, calories burned -- you should input your weight. and they have a little maths key in the instructions on how to determine what your stride is so you can run with it walk with it, whatever you want! all the way up to a 135cm stride which i assume is flat out running or for a reeeeaaalllyyyy tall person since my stride is about 45cm (im a slow walker though so that might also have something to do with it ) so yes! im quite happy! after searching around they say you should aim for 10,000 steps per day. today is my trial day, im going to see how many steps i average (not much im sure) and then work my way up! itll be quite a motivation to see the number and push myself an extra 500 steps just to be proud of an accomplishment, ive always been a very visual person. graphs, charts, numbers! i love it all. so we will see how things progress in the next week or so!  also i reviewed my eating journal the past couple weeks and i noticed a few things. when i lost 1.4kg i was eating between 26-28pts per day and didnt eat more than 8flex points. this week when i lost nothing i was sometimes eating 16pts & ate 33 flexpoints in total. also before i was drinking 3 glasses of milk per day and 1 full glass of cranberry juice while this week i managed 100g of yoghurt & a bit of milk in my cereal & 1/5 glass of cranberry juice at best (i use cranberry juice to get my daily vitamin c allowance, its very high) also this week i ate SO much fibre but didnt drink nearly as much water so i think that posed a teency problem on more than 1 occassion. i'll spare you the dirty details ;)  this weeks goals  1. check steps & do my best to start out to 5,000 steps (its a good start, half of t' recommended) 2. drink 3 glasses of milk per day 3. drink 1 FULL glass of cranberry juice per day 4. get some fresh air at least once 5. go easy on the fibre rich cereals & when i do, be sure to drink at least 1 extra bottle of water on that day.  there. i think those are perfectly achievable goals & considering my period is due in 6 days i have to be sure to eat regularly... not too long between meals or i will get uber bitchy & ravenous and want to eat the world in 3 bites.   *****UPDATE*****  im taking off the pedometer for the day... ive walked 328 steps! i clearly have a lot of work to do to reach my first goal of 5,000 steps. maybe i should start with 1,000 LOL",female,23,indUnk,Gemini,1
600497,4095054,2004-08-13,"after chatting with E.  she made some very valid points about me not weighing this week because my periods due in exactly 6 days and im feeling fat and crummy overall  but i decided i need to be an adult and face the music so i stepped on the scale this morning. not a single thing lost, not a single thing gained. i stayed EXACTLY the same. the numbers didnt even flash up or down for a second. 3 times stepping on gave me the exact same number everytime. so thats that. my plan of losing 2.5lb this week did not work despite doing everything right & having 2 flexpoints left over. im not sure how i will manage to meet my 222.5lb goal by next weekend because thats 5lb, i just wasnt counting on this to happen but i suppose when it comes to a lifelong weight changing decision a woman must be prepared for these times along the way. so, no hard feelings.  i thought maybe it was because i ate almost all my flexpoints while last week i didnt eat a single one. or did i??? i would have to read back to find out. maybe i ate about 8 but certainly not 33. so this week i will make an effor to eat many more veggies & again, when im hungry not according to schedule. i hate eating on a schedule, i'll just eat when im hungry. that seems to work best. also continue on with my portion control because im feeling very good about my progress in that area. my measuring cup is my favourite thing these days. i havent used the scale in ages, this works perfectly. 1 cup of cooked meat/fish, 1 cup of cooked pasta or rice or couscous, 2 cups of salad.  yes, im loving it indeed! :D  well, ive decided the greatest problem right now is my lack of exercise. i want to get a pedometer & see how many steps (km's) i make on a regular day then just go from there. im sure it will also be motivation to move more.  so i'll wear it to the gym when i go on the treadmill together with my heart monitor and keep my heart rate in fatburning zone about 150-155 . well the thoughts are all jumbled in my brain so im going away to think about it some more and figure out what im trying to say :)  happy saturday! movie day! woohooo! i dont feel like eating anything particular this evening so i probably wont eat at all -- movie snack that is, usually its a very specific craving, right now im not having anything at all so i'll leave it at that. ciao darlings xox",female,23,indUnk,Gemini,1
600498,4095054,2004-08-13,"well not too many as im alotted 35per week.  flexpoints that is... but i used 15 last night. met my 28pt target then went 15fp in. i see ive written down that i ate the leftover noodles from dinner, a couple pancakes, 1 slice more of bread than i planned. and 8pts in nutella which i really didnt want but its the only chocolate in the house other than my nesquick. of course after M. saw me getting into that he sneakily disposed of the nutella while i was in the shower. maybe he just knows me better than i know myself. again, this ongoing struggle with being honest to myself & everyone else is taking its toll and i feel im slowly going slightly insane.  i suppose slightly is better than fully.  isnt it?  please? someone?  *squeak*  really though, im not doing terribly, perfectly within my point range & flexpoint range, i have 2 for today IF i need them... im veryvery curious to see the number on the scale tomorrow because as id planned on a 1.5lb loss i highly doubt that happened especially considering what i saw on wednesday! and even despite me doing everything right with tracking every morsel & accounting for EVERYTHING its a tad frustrating if it happens that way but all i can do is stay positive and if the scale doesnt show me what i want to see then buckle down, ignore the heat and get my ass on a bike.... or the treadmill. today im going for a walk since its dark and rainy, windy and cool.  the perfect weather for walking on the treadmill!!!  :)  although, if there is no loss or a gain even, i will be quite mad because i did do everything right AND it is only my 2nd weigh in since beginning! its supposed to go so easily in the beginning. i refuse to lose 200g per week ... i wont do that again, i cant, i will end up on medication and bouncing off padded walls at the funnyfarm.  see, please. tell me what is wrong with this  ***Update... after reading around a lot of weightwatchers places, ive realised that going under 28pts despite using all of my flexpoints, really is not a good idea, ive tweaked it to make my 28pt daily target.  breakfast: allbran plus (0) fruit&fibre (2) skim milk (1) orange juice (1.5) = 4.5 lunch: 1 cup homemade hummus (4) raw veggies (0)  cup of tea (0) = 4 snack: 1apple (1) snack: yoghurt (1)  blueberries (0.5) honey (0.5) = 2 dinner: 1 cup couscous (3) prawns (3) raw veggie salad with olives & feta (2) = 8 snack: 2 cups cubed watermelon = 2  ADDED: 6cups popcorn & almost 2tbsp butter = 6.5pts NEW total: 28pts!  total: 21.5pts yes im aware my target is 28 but i ate 17fp over last night! icant bring myself to eat more... maybe ill have a glass of milk with my watermelon... im just too frazzled over this, i need to relax a little. i feel the threads of angst in my stomach and its not pleasant! i dont want to fall down this hole again.",female,23,indUnk,Gemini,1
600499,4095054,2004-08-12,"i did have one yesterday... it was most unpleasant.  despite it being our anniversary i just wanted to be alone & was happy M. was out almost all day doing his computer thing, getting it all organised and ready to be sold etc. i broke down more than a couple times, had moments of utterly dramatic despair...  felt like nothing in the world would ever allow me to lose weight, i would be stuck in this country forever, we would be homeless.. you name it i thought it.   thankfully today the PMS monster has left, im doing much better & by the time dinner rolled around last night i was much better & able to enjoy our anniversary with M. without dragging the whole mood down into my puddle of misery. so now all is well with the world, that brief pms encounter was just a preview of rocky days to come which im REALLY not looking forward too but hey, its something ive got to deal with every month so COMEON lets get it over with!!!!!!!  today with some planning & a very clear idea of what i wanted to eat for dinner, i was able to hit my 28pt mark without any problem!  i always feel proud & angsty at the same time when i do that. proud because im doing what im supposed to be doing. angsty because it feels like if i dont lower my intake at least 1 pt per week i will never, in a million years, lose any weight which is bloody ridiculous but i cant help thinking it, the destructive thoughts just squeeze into my head unnoticed...  i think my inner fat girl is trying to get revenge for me wanting to lose weight. shes trying to sabotage my progress...   i wanted to lose 1kg this week but something tells me its going to be more like 200g  despite me being completely honest, tracking every single morsel & still having 19flex points left over PLUS 1 whole activity point.   sometimes i just dont get it. but i will keep at it.   ALTHOUGH if doing this the right way i fall back into that measly 200g per weekpattern i did while i was lying & cheating my way through before, im going to be THOROUGHLY pissed off and self hating & want to give up in the end.  *sigh* seems the monster is sneaking in... im going to leave while im still in one piece....",female,23,indUnk,Gemini,1
600500,4095054,2004-08-11,"as i mentioned, i do love a lot of healthy foods and although the drool factor is not AS high its still pretty high because these things can be damn tasty...  Favourites  Fruit: mango, all varities of melon, peaches, nectarines, apples, kiwis, all varities of berries especially raspberries, mandarines, grapes (purple more so than green), bananas. basically its safe to say if its a fruit i will indeed love it .... except figs... they freak me out for some reason.  veggies: if its raw, cold, clean & fresh i will love it. if its a veggie that must be cooked to be eaten i usually dont like it. i love tomatoes, cucumber, all peppers, carrots, fresh peas in the pod, spinach, most lettuce except iceburg, broccoli, celery, radishes,alfalfa... it would probably just be easier to say : if its cooked, i will hate it :)  fish:  if its fresh & from the sea its all good...   im not a fan of saltwater fish with the exception of rainbow trout.  well i do love a lot of healthy foods but im not that great at thinking of them right now...  hummus is great! i love it....  anyway, today is validation wednesday and im exactly the same as i was on saturday which means that 700g i lost by monday must have been the dehydration (i dont usually drink anything on sundays, its a bad habit im trying to fix) combined with the super salty meal i had last night im still positive there will be a loss come saturday!!  last night i was so desperate for protein it was unreal!!! i managed to eat 28pts for dinner alone, i had 2 pieces of cevapcici & 1 large pattie... that combined with the 2 big handfuls of fries & the tzatziki sauce i raked in 28pts using 11 flexpoints for the day.  i think the most important thing is im actually being honest about it & recording/tracking everything. just 6 months ago i would have ignored half of what i ate & not recorded it AT ALL because, well, if i cant see it written down & people dont know about it then it obviously didnt happen. i hated it about myself & dont want to be like that anymore. ive changed a lot in the past 2 months, i just feel... raw... if that makes any sense. its difficult to explain, maybe the best way would be to say im evolving and im in a raw stage right now and instead of lying and medicating myself im trying to be honest & accountable for everything. ive journaled more in the past few weeks than i have in my entire life it feels. i have 2 online journals & 2 paper journals. not to mention talking to people outright like ive never done before.  its a process.",female,23,indUnk,Gemini,1
600501,4095054,2004-08-10,"on the weightloss front im doing alright! im doing a challenge now to meet my 28pts everyday!! yes, very important and today ive met it! feels good to do that although i feel a little sceptical that any losses will happen because ive eaten under for so long :-$ damn im so paranoid sometimes. and its an unfounded paranoia, everything will go well! yes! it will all be fine.  today i wanted to list some of my favourites... junk food specifically. what i eat when things arent going well. maybe by seeing this list as one big pile of junk i will be more careful about ever overdosing again, that is the plan anyway.  favourites  icecream!! ben & jerrys' cherry garcia.  haagen daazs' vanilla swiss almond. baskin robbins' maui brownie madness. i also love chocolate chip mint from most brands & any icecream sandwich will do. when i was about 13 i would devour the oreo cookie icecream sandwiches, about 1 per day they were HUGE. of course, i was skinny back then :-P  popcorn!! of course, ANY popcorn will do but theatre popcorn is my favourite. as well as the white cheddar popcorn from the grocery store  waffels!! again, any cakey thick waffels.  i love them blegian style with high piles of whipped cream.  KFC! i eat the skin off the extra crispy and throw the chicken away, then i'll eat a whole tub of gravy with the fries.   FRIED things onion rings (anything onion & deep fried) deep fried prawns, fries--poutine with lots of gravy, the chinese pork balls with sweet & sour sauce  cookies! anything soft& chewy was a comfort to eat.  my fave was chewy chips ahoy & soft chewy oatmeal raisin.  *k starting to strain to think of things now....   chocolate.  of course this is a given but more of an indulgence than a binge, i love really nice bonbons & truffels.  fudge.  not a common occurance but i did love a bite or 2 of good quality tasty fudge.  pizza. lots of toppings, extra cheese. i did this about twice a week. sometimes more since where i worked i got a huge staff discount & it was cheaper than buying groceries.  doritos/chips type things. the cool ranch flavour is my fave, i also loved ketchup lays and salt & vinegar and i vaguely remember a crunchy ring of sorts... an onion flavoured ring chip type thing. i did buy those quite often but cant really remember them. oh and real canadian cheezies. those were a HUGE weakness of mine. they gave me the worst heartburn but i loved them.   ok. i think that about covers it. reading back over the list its almost embarrasing but i must realise that i didnt eat all those things in 1 sitting. it really doesnt make it any easier though... i feel like a huge porker, in a funny way :)  when it came to restaurants i loved the Keg, the steak & lobster. i would leave my steak & order a second lobster half :) then maybe a few bites of salad but id usually be too full after the whole lobster. i loved olive garden. i just love all italian food, we'll leave that at that. i loved chinese restaurants because of the fried foods, i loved japanese restaurants for the sushi, i loved vietnamese restaurants because i love vietnamese food.... sometimes i loved to eat a hamburger from mcdonalds! with a shake! and usually an apple pie becuase i loved those crispy warm little apple pies!  sometimes i would buy a whole box of tim hortons timbits and eat them in the dark of my bedroom after work. sometimes i would sit in tim hortons drinking 1 cup of coffee after another eating my favourites - bear claw, long john & old fashioned cake donut. occassionally with a lemon jelly wiht the white powder.  i would smoke 1 pack after the other of matinee extra lights, dipping my hand into a big box of quaker granola cereal at 4 am while i chatted away on my computer.  i knew nothing of nutrition, portion control or felt the need to have self control in teh slightest.  oh well, those days are over... its not even nice to think back to how unhealthy i was. im going to have some tomato toast & watermelon for lunch now :) tomorrow i will counter this with my favourite healthier choices these days!",female,23,indUnk,Gemini,1
600502,4095054,2004-08-09,"well, i guess that would be me wouldnt it? yes. the horribly awful slacker that is me. no excuse, i just havent reached it! yesterday anyway. yesterday after planning dinner and everything i ended up with a grand total of 12 (of 28) soooo i thought of different ways to increase that! oh! oven fries instead of rice! thats 2 extra, i will bread my fish! thats another 1pt, use an eggwhitwash first!!! 0.5pt OOOO and a dollop of ketchup for my fries! another 0.5! so i actually ended up with 16 instead of 12 which isnt the best improvement but its a start. actually, i didnt finish all my fish *sigh*  another day though! today is that! another day indeed!!! and so far i have 14pts which leaves 14 free for dinner because these days in the heat when nothing is clean and turning on the oven or stove increases the apartment temp no less than 10 degrees its awwwwful. so! dinner is actually a spure of the moment thing. so with 14 dinner pts available thats enough for a pizza! or what have you... it probably wont be pizza because wednesday is pizza day -- pizzas are 5.50 euros on those days :D cheaper yet would be frozen pizzas in the oven, but weve tried that and they just arent as tasty and satisfying as the italian style deli pizzas! i love me some margherita. rowr. this wed. i will ask for a margherita with pineapple!!! last week was funghi maybe i can convince them im worth some pineapple YUM.  anyway enough rambling about pizza.....  overal its just been great for staying on plan these days... my pill packet says the PMS monster is due to rear its ugly head in the next week and a half or so, im not looking forward to it but i will do my best to accomodate whatever mad crazy craving is thrown my way.  also, i stepped on the scale this morning out of sleepy curiosity and im down another 1.5lb since saturday... of course nothing is official until saturday but im pretty positive, as always!",female,23,indUnk,Gemini,1

Marcel is happy for me he just wants me to keep my goals realistic which im trying hard to do.  3.88lb in 2 weeks is realistic isnt it?? almost 2lb per week?  i think its quite doable ...  the PMS monster is not due to hit for another week or 2 anyway so i feel secure & safe in my goal setting!  so a recap on the week....  i stayed within my points everyday, sometimes being a teency bit under but trying to compensate with milk or juice here & there. i used 8 of my flexpoints, leaving 27 over which is alright in my book. i tracked every meal in my notebook, did my best to compensate for the heat & lack of wanting to cook -- one day we had mcdonalds.... i got a grilled chicken salad & used only 1/4 of the dressing -- the amount of dressing in those packets is phenomenal!!!! id like to TASTE my salad thank you very much, not drown it.   it was tasty & satisfying & had lots of veggies!  so while M. had 2 mcchickens & a mcolympic greek whatever it was, i stuck to my salad & then we shared a couple wee donuts!  it was wonderful!  gilette satin care melon splash shaving gel.... dont eat it no matter how good it smells and it smells like candy...  like it belongs wrapped in bubbalicious paper   i leave you on that note.",female,23,indUnk,Gemini,1
600504,4095054,2004-08-06,"so tired... oh so so tired.  i cannot explain the feeling of exhaustion taking over my body.  its overwhelming! i lay awake until 2 or 3am then finally doze off, wanting to awake at 8 so the cycle doesnt continue. but i cant uncement my eyelids until 10! unbelievable. not that this has much to do with weightloss. well, maybe it does because come autumn/winter, im awake a lot more & therefore have many more hours in the day to contemplate food. summer just drains me completely, its very very unpleasant. its at least 80 celsius here today it must be! i cant imagine it being cooler than that :P anyway, enough complaining about the weather!  im looking forward to weigh in tomorrow, i think about a 5lb loss maybe more is on the table and im going to celebrate with some caffeine free diet coke. yes, maybe even TWO cans! im such a rebel.  my eating has been a little wonky lately i suspect because of the heat... i have no energy, no appetite.. everything is just BLAH but im getting my 2 litres of water so im pretty sure those pounds lost is not water weight. even when i started losing weight for the very first time ever about 3 years ago, i never lost that famed water weight everyone talks about... back then i was drinking 4 litres of water a day. of course i realise now i was really crazy back then and should pay no attention to those fanatic type habits.  today i made my points to 27.5! yipee! this is getting easier! still 0.5pt under but i might have some melon slices after dinner which should compensate.  when the weather cools down i want to start making exercise goals... i hate exercise *whine* but i have a gym membership thats good till about april i think & its costing 55 euros a month... i could freeze the account but they wont allow it for less than 3months at a time. and well, it'd better not be that hot for that much longer or im moving to the arctic.  so today i had a fab lunch, light & simple, low in points and utterly delicious especially with the heat! 4tbsp lowfat yoghurt, 1/2cup frozen blueberries. squirt of honey. 2pts. frozen yummy goodness ohhh it was fantastic. when i make frozen yoghurt i would throw those ingreds. into a food processor but that would have taken time which meant standing sweating in the kitchen which just didnt appeal, so i ate it like that! delish!  so if i tell you a secret, promise not to tell? ok then i stepped on the scale this morning. honestly i thought it was saturday ... THATS how tired i am and it wasnt until Marcel came home that i realised it was friday because he had some internet installation to do on friday. PHEW so anyway, the scale said 102.9kg which is 226.38 lbs which means 3.62lb lost since saturday. im very pleased! and thats why im pretty sure i'll be almost 5lb down come tomorrow morning!  such a great boost for the beginning of the journey. i'll be soooo happy to be 155lb again, honestly! and there is only 71.38lb to go! i can do that! my first goal is to hit 222.5lb and i want to do that by next weigh in... not tomorrow, but the saturday after that!  yay! although my inner fatgirl is nagging me & saying i will only lose weight this week because every week i have to decrease my food intake until im not eating anything at all to lose poundage. and that the only reason im losing weight now is because im not exercising and my body is eating all the muscle and eventually im not going to be able to walk from lack of muscle tissue, atrophyyyy she screams... atrophyyyyy. stupid ridiculous inner fatgirl. damn you. i will keep doing what im doing so shut up. hear me??? you will no longer have power over me or my decisions!!!!!! believe it :-P pppfflltt so there. hmph.  heh.",female,23,indUnk,Gemini,1
600505,4095054,2004-08-05,"mmm the silky creaminess. decadent. sensuous.  i would love a little piece right about now!  they do have fudge here but its not good and i wont eat it unless its the best and the best comes from a little place i used to know but never knew the name of!  odd, since i went there once a week for a little sample.  my mum sent M. a nice chunk of canadian maple fudge for x-mas and he loved it! i have to admit the few bites i had were exquisite indeed.  oh how i dream of the rich creamy fudginess *shudder* so sweet it burns.  just a taste. nothing more. -- i could never eat vast quantities of sweet--  chocolate is a different subject all together.  well i have to say when the fudge came to me in my dream last night i was more than happy. i swear, i could taste it when i woke up. the maple creamy wonderousness that is the maple fudge :)  ok, enough about that before i start to lose my mind.  i always said when goal weight hit (155lb) i would never ever eat any 'bad' stuff because i would not want to ruin all my efforts  but please, who am i fooling.  those things, although not required for my exsistance, are special.  and a wonderful treat from time to time.  when i was younger i would secretly buy lots of junky food with my babysitting money and sneak it into my room to eat from under my pillow in the evenings. there was a strange comfort that came along with my ritual.  being curled up on my side with a good book, sneaking chip after chip slowly out from under the blanket or pillow, trying hard not to crinkle the bag yet feeling oddly satisfied when a little crinkle came with the chip i extracted.  it was always doritos. cool ranch flavour.  if i needed something sweet it would be peanut m&ms or oreo double stuff cookies. but mostly it was the doritos.  i remember an event specifically that happened about 6 months ago? i dont remember the date exactly but i remember the event. i had purchased a bag of the cool ranch (here they are called cool american but they are still the same flavour)  to eat on saturday night while i watched my movie (bags come in 150g)  anyway, M and i had had a fight the night before, i never remember what we fight about but it was probably something petty & stupid as it usually is (although a rare occurance thankfully, i value my peace)   so after we fought, he left to do some work i grabbed my bag of cool ranch and crawled into bed with a book.   AND put the chips under the duvet cover.   im not quite sure why... i was alone. and besides, M. has worked hard to unteach my hamster behaviours because i still caught myself doing it from time to time -- that he found out about during our relationship. there was no need to hide.  so what compelled me to fall back into that pattern? i can only imagine it must have been the comfort.  *sigh*  sometimes i just dont get it.  anyway, im doing well with points. i must have used about 8 flexpoints since saturday which leaves 27 until friday night, not too bad for my first week i must admit! im quite pleased with the whole process. everything feels different this time around.  last time i lost about 19lb in 1 year (which i gained back in a matter of 2 months)  but honestly, i wasnt being true to myself or the program. i would think -- no no i'll just eat that and not count it because if it doesnt show up on paper where i & everyone can see it, then it means i didnt actually consume it.  i scoff (instransitive) at my former pathetic self.  and i never want to go back to that again, i feel very angry right now for cheating myself out of the progress i could have made.   for the summer i might have enjoyed for the first time since i moved out of Italy.   ANGRY!  i cant even talk about it.  im at boiling point and its not because of the 40degree heat enveloping me. although that certainly doesnt help.  scoff.",female,23,indUnk,Gemini,1
600506,4095054,2004-08-04,"yes, its wednesday. that time when i require a little midweek boost (or kick in the ass whatever the case may be) so i tend to step on the scale to see which direction my weight is going. lets just say this was certainly a boost! im at  103.3kg (227.3lb) which is a 1.2kg (2.6lb) drop from saturday. now by this time anything can happen by saturdays official weigh in but im feeling pretty positive! ive made it again today to 28pts without much trouble which is a wonderful thing!! it seems to be getting easier once im back into the swing of things! WEDNESDAY NIGHT PIZZA NIGHT ok you might be wondering (or not) why i want to have pizza when i just saw that fantastic review on the scale but honestly, thats part of my routine. and besides, i had such a horrible headache last night from teh heat that we ended up eating the pizza last night and tonight i'll make the chicken. so there, that was done and still not too much damage done. i had an italian style pizza funghi which is one of my faves. next to margherita. sure i do love american style thick crust heavily loaded pizzas from time to time but truth is its not that readily availble in my opinion as it is so much more expensive. besides, the lighter fare = the lighter bum and thats what im all about these days. and who can handle all that grease anyway? id be running to the bathroom all night long!! oh, was that one of those TMI moments? heh. anyway, its almost 13:30 i really must get my hummus made! yes, homemade hummus for lunch, with a couple cups of raw veggies!! i keep my hummus quick & easy, although i dont know how it can be any other way!! 1/2cup or 1cup chickpeas (garbanzo beans) couple tbsp fatfree plain yoghurt, few ( i like 5) cloves fresh garlic, cayenne pepper, paprika, lemon juice. whizz in a food processor and VOILA tasty, filling,spicey lunch that keeps vampires away... whats not to love!?!? :D",female,23,indUnk,Gemini,1
600507,4095054,2004-08-03,"YAY! first day, while i was eating breaky i sat down and wrote out everything i would eat today -- a plan if you will then, after tallying up the points i hit 28! my daily target! without having to rack my brain and figure out where to add things to make it :D im very pleased with this...  breakfast: fruit'n'fibre with skim milk = 3pts snack: smoothie: instant coffee granules, bit of yoghurt, bit of milk, ice = 2pts lunch: tuna sarnie: 1/2cup tuna,1tbsp mixed mayo & yoghurt, 2 slices bread, cucumber=7pts snack: 1 3/4 cup strawberries, 1 apple = 2pts dinner: honey pineapple glazed chicken with rice, grilled pineapple rings & raw veggie salad=9pts snack: 6cups popcorn, 1tbsp butter & shaking of popcorn seasoning. caffeine free diet coke = 5 pts  total: 28!!!! wooooowoooooo finally! :D i have used about 5 flexpoints since saturday, with the odd snagged oreo cookie here and there which ive written in my notebook but not mentioned here. but yes, i have indeed had an oreo here & there.  im feeling pretty good! positive... of course that all usually changes when the pms monster takes over my body but hell im going to enjoy all the time i can while its not here !! i'll do my midweek validation weighin tomorrow as usual so we will see whats happened in 4 days, hopefully itll be a preview of good things to come, im definitely positive thats for sure.",female,23,indUnk,Gemini,1
600508,4095054,2004-08-02,"so im having a difficult time coming up with all my points for a day, even now that i count fruit as points!   i never seemed to have this problem in the past, maybe its just the heat is making me lose my appetite?  so far i have written out  breakfast: apple = 1pt brunch/lunch:  bowl of fruit'n'fibre with all-bran plus and skim milk = 4pts snack: tea with tsp honey & 1 kiwi = 1.5pts snack: 2 slices toast with thick slices tomato = 2pts dinner: 120g cooked prawns over 1 cup cooked pasta with 2tsp olive oil, dash of chili sauce & herbs.  2 cups raw veggies/salad with 1tbsp apple honey vinaigrette = 9pts snack: glass of skim milk with nesquick = 2pts  total: 19.5pts  :-$  eep  thats 8.5pts under...   i could have 2 glasses of milk with nesquick, that would make my daily calcium requirement. so that adds another 2.  = 21.5pts.  ummm.  1 glass of cranberry juice will bring me to my daily vit.c requirement... thats 2pts added on. =23.5pts  hmm.  would it be terrible to stop there? i honestly dont know what else to add.... i could say i'll add another cup of pasta which would bring me to 27.5pts  but im REALLY trying to get my portion problem under control  and thats my biggest priority at the moment. 1 cup of pasta is 1 portion.  not the 2-4cups i used to indulge my lazy ass in.  i hereby pronounce myself finished for the day.  4.5pts under or  not! because i have that right and my fatbutt needs to learn what a proper portion is.  so in winter my appetite increases but i exercise like MAD as well so im hoping all this will balance . why am i so thoroughly affected by the elements. great goddess i havent a clue. but im one happy camper these days despite the heat :)",female,23,indUnk,Gemini,1
600509,4095054,2004-08-01,"i clearly have no idea what im doing...  and although i live with a computer genius hes not a webdesigner so he couldnt help me put the sidebar on the LEFT side.  the only other template i actually like that has the sidebar on the left im using for my other blogger page.  obligatory porridge.  well i want this page with the dewy leaves & dark green colours but the damn sidebar is on the right :P oh well,  there are greater problems in the world.  everythings going very well for my 3rd day on ww flexpts.  im enjoying it quite a bit actually! and although i would never admit this in public *shh you didnt hear it from me* im actually looking forward to doing some exercise when the weather cools down!  sure i can floor exercise in the airconditioned bliss of my living room & possibly some light cardio in the bedroom *winkwink* but my treadmill & bike are in a part of the apartment that is NOT airco'd and thats well... thats just unbearable!  i have no clue what to make for dinner tonight... normally i make shellfish on mondays but 1-my kitchen is a sty because im too hot & lazy to clean it. -- poor excuse considering i have a dishwasher LOL ok ok i'll get the dishes going. but that doesnt help problem 2-lack of groceries. ok thats easily remedied but it STILL doesnt change the fact that im too lazy to cook when its hot *whine* PHEW now that ive got the whine out i feel much better and ready to cook.  yes, this is just the madness you will encounter along my journey!  once i was debating whether or not to go to the gym, i stayed in bed and whined and cried and kicked my feet for like an hour with Marcel my husband tugging on my arms & saying encouraging words.   finally i got dressed and stomped & slammed doors and pouted and whined all the way to the gym. i stayed there for 1.5hrs and had a kickass workout.    go figure.  anyway! off to get those dishes in the dishwasher!!",female,23,indUnk,Gemini,1
600510,4095054,2004-08-01,"this is something i used to suffer from. quite badly actually... i used to step on about 2093569824365 times per day in hopes of seeing some minor changes. of course there were changes and not just minor but i would gain like 6lb in the course of a day! *gasp* it was so pathetic.... well thankfully now iv gained some sort of realistic views of the whole scale situation and no longer have a driving need to step on so often. once a week is usually enough although i do enjoy having some validation half way through the week. weigh ins are first thing saturday morning, naked of course. yesterday i weighed in at 230lb which is almost my ultimate high point... which was 237.6 and not too far away from where i am now. although i know theres not much that can happen overnight in the form of a loss, i feel slimmer already! just the choice of getting something accomplished again... tracking my day, its so difficult to explain but that little purpose has given me a reason. i want to succeed! all the way this time. i have no halfass feelings. i want to live a normal life with activity and healthy foods and the occassional sunday night chinese or wednesday night pizza. and of course everyone has their down moments. i fully expect them to happen from time to time. i turn into a raving crazy lunatic about 4 days per month. the 3 days leading up to my period and the day after it begins. why not the day it actually begins? well that day my cramps are at their worse so i cant tell the difference between hunger pangs & period cramps so i usually end up eating about 1 slice of toast & 1 cup of tea through the day. but those other 4 days? BABY WATCH OUT i will eat YOU if you are standing in front of my beloved waffels with chocolate icecream. or whatever my weird monthly craving might be. so 4 days of the month i try my best to plan accordingly & when the days hit im not lost. i plan, for example this month i wanted to OD on chocolate, NOTHING was helping. so, i stuffed a wee chocolate muffin into a bowl then scooped a couple balls of belgian double chocolate chocolate chip icecream over it then i melted a few squares of black pure 70% cocoa solid type chocolate in the microwave and poured it over. i swear, its not a lot of food but you feel SO incredibly satisfied after that you dont need chocoalte for an entire month!! which is actually the point :) anyway, my cravings vary in both intensity & madness and since i have a few weeks to go i wont dwell on them!  on to other things it is still too hot to do anything so i figure even though exercise DOES help, being as tubby as i am now its possible to lose quite a bit of weight focusing just on the eating aspect. so i figure by the time it cools down i'll have lost quite a few pounds and will be ready & willing to teach myself to enjoyyyyy exercise. said with the most enthousiasm i can muster considering exercise is the bane of my exsistance. honestly. i dont hate many things but sweating is definitely one of them. unless its sauna induced... or sex. cause, well... thats just one of the fun bits!  so! considering its sunday & veryvery hot im doing quite well point wise.. its 3pm and ive used 12 which is actually a typical sunday for me! so i have 16 left to use the rest of the day to make my target. M. was edging towards chinese since we still have those cupons to use. let me see how many points in babi pangang & steamed rice.... ooo 16 for a serving of both!!!! fantastic. well, it says 1 cup of sweet&sour pork is 12 points which is more or less what babi pangang is except there is less than 1cup in 1 serving here. its more like 1.5cups for 2 people. i guess these charts are all about american servings? well i'll just adapt everything.. count a few less points. or have a bit more rice to even things out. i'll also have some soysauce which is 0 and some cold slices of cucumber which is 0. caffeine free diet coke is 0 also. it works out.  i need to drink more water! i used to drink 4 litres a day and had the best skin. now im lucky to make 2 litres and my skin hates me. 4 was too much though.. i'll focus on making 2 a steady habit then add half a litre so my bladder can have time to expand accordingly. because you know, a woman jumping to use the toilet every 5 minutes? not that attractive... and im ALL about being attractive. unless chocolate is involved. then its fend for yourself & stay out of my way!",female,23,indUnk,Gemini,1
