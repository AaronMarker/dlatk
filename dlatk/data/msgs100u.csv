3215,4088894,2004-07-30,"I have been a member of the Dragonswood site for quite a while now & am pleased to say that recently, I was asked to write a regular column for their magazine (which, incidentally, is now available in some shops over in the USA & even NZ, as well as quite a few here in the UK). My first column is in the latest issue (out for Lammas & Mabon) & *puffs out chest with pride* is one of the featured articles mentioned on the front cover. I'm pleased as punch over that, I have to say, as this is my first professional writing venture (I've only ever written items for Triptych which I produce myself before now). Anyway, I thought I'd pop the article up here too & provide a link to the Dragonswood website, where you can order the magazine direct from them:  urlLink http://www.dragonswood.org.uk/index.php    THE ARTICLE:  Simple Witchery By Mabon   What is Simple Witchery?  As long as I can remember, Iâve always liked to keep things as simple as possible â I never saw the point in taking a complicated route if a simpler one presented itself to me. This isnât laziness, just common sense, from my point of view. Itâs something that has bothered me for a long time, this need people often seem to feel to complicate things which neednât be so hard, and so I set out to boil things down to their barest components, take out all things unnecessary & just get things done.  This is, essentially, what Simple Witchery is all about; leaving out all the extraneous information & implements, taking advantage of what we have ready to hand, & simply enjoying the flow of things. I hope that with this column, I can share some of this with all of you, & perhaps even get you thinking of ways to simplify things in your own, unique way!   Why Simple Witchery?  When you lift out all the superfluous items, you are left with the most important element of the Craft. Which element is that? Earth? Air? Fire or Water? Perhaps Spirit? No, none of these. The most important element is always YOU; the person living it & experiencing all it has to offer. When you learn to rely on yourself & your own abilities, you learn that nothing is impossible, you can do anything you set your mind to. Thatâs what itâs all about; setting your mind to something & getting it done.  For example, I donât use a wand in any or my work. Yes, I own one â a very ornate & beautiful one which was given to me by a very close friend â but I see it as purely a decoration for my home & it sits on a cherry wood stand atop my bookcase, where I can see it whenever I look up. It has never & will never be used by me or anyone else. Why? Because it doesnât need to be. I have no need of a wand when I have myself. Besides, what if at some point I had to cast in an emergency & found myself without my wand, what would I do? Panic? Well, thatâs not really very sensible, is it? Iâd do whatever needed to be done without my wand & it would work every bit as well as it would while using a wand!  Basically, all you need to get yourself started is focus of will & energy. Once you get the hang of that, thereâll be no holding you back & no end to the things you can accomplish. Over the coming issues, Iâll be exploring more of Simple Witchery &, hopefully, taking you along for the ride. I really hope youâll find it fun!   Tâis the Seasonâ¦  These are some very simple rituals for the coming Sabbats â ones I use myself. I hope youâll enjoy them.   Lammas (1st August)  Lammas is the first of the harvest festivals & celebrates the beginning of us reaping what we have sown earlier in the year. It is traditionally a time for feasting, having fun, & preparing ourselves for a little more hard work before the harvest is done!   On the Altar:  Large beeswax candle Lengths of green & red cord Wine, bread & honey   The Ritual:  Cleanse and cast the circle.Light the beeswax candle. Knot the piece of red cord and pass it over the candle, circling the base. Think of all that is passing and the sacrifices you have made. Give them up freely as you pass the red cord over the flame. Knot the green cord and pass it over the candle to lie on top of the red cord. This represents the achievements which will be built on your sacrifices â your harvest. Consecrate the wine and drink in honour of the Sun's power and your own achievements. Consecrate the bread and honey, and take them to the four corners saying:  'This is my offering;   This is my sacrifice.'  (Move round the circle deosil (clockwise) starting at North) Spread the honey on the bread. Eat and drink, communing with the season, saving some to put into the Earth as an offering later. Close the circle.   Mabon (22nd September)  Mabon is the Autumnal Equinox; a time of balance between darkness & light. But after this, the days will begin to grow shorter & the nights will draw in earlier. As the second of the harvest festivals, we celebrate it with the many orchard fruits which are now in season.   On the Altar:  An ear of corn Dried leaves A deep purple candle Wine & bread   The Ritual:  Cleanse and cast the circle.Light the purple candle and think about the meaning of the season. Name the dried leaves for anything to be swept out of your life. Drop them deliberately to the floor to be swept up later (keep them to scatter into running water). Pick up the corn and say:  'The God has descended into the land.   Now he makes His journey into the Underworld.   Days grow dim, nights grow long, but we do not weep,   For behold, he has left his seed as a promise of his return!'  Take the corn and bread deosil (clockwise) round the circle, stopping at each corner and saying:  'This is the seed and this is my harvest.'  Direct healing thoughts towards any part of the world where there is famine. Eat the bread and drink to the Lord and Lady. Close the circle.   Seasonal Project:   Goddess Eye  A Goddess eye is said to watch over & protect the home, & makes a wonderful gift for a like-minded friend. Making something yourself means it is very personal & the effort put into it gives it that little bit extra power. Hang it in the window to catch the light.  Materials required:  2 sticks on roughly equal length Yarn or embroidery threads of various colours Scissors (to cut the threads of course!)  Method:  Make a slipknot on the end of the thread you will use for the centre of the cross & slide the loop over the 2 sticks. Once the thread is centred, pull the knot tight & spread the stick arms out into the form of a cross. Wrap the thread diagonally over the centre twice for each side (NW-SE, then NE-SW) Start wrapping the thread around the sticks (moving deosil around the eye). Start at one point, move the thread over the stick, come round the back crossing over the front & move onto the next arm, keeping the thread tight. When you want to change to another colour, hide the knot at the back of the stick so the ends can't be seen. When you're finished, double-loop the thread over the last arm. You can decorate the ends of the arms with leather, beads or feathers â however you like. To hang the eye up, add a loop in the same colour as the thread nearest the outer edge, by pushing the ends through the eye (about an inch or so down the arm) from the front, then pushing the ends back through to the front again higher up, then tying a knot to form a loop. This should hold the eye upright when it's hung up.   Kitchen Witch   Herb Scented Flat Bread  This flatbread doesn't contain yeast, so it's quick and simple to make. You can substitute your favourite herbs for the ones suggested. A delicious recipe to use for ritual or any time. Makes 3.  Ingredients:  1 cup plus 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon finely chopped fresh sage 1 teaspoon finely chopped fresh chives 1 teaspoon finely chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley 2 1/2 tablespoons vegetable shortening 3 tablespoons milk 1/2 teaspoon coarse salt, for sprinkling 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, for brushing  1. In the bowl of a food processor, combine the flour, baking powder, salt, sage, chives, and parsley; process for 5 seconds to combine. Add vegetable shortening and process until well combined, about 15 seconds. Add milk and 2 tablespoons water, and process until the dough comes together, about 7 seconds.  2. Transfer dough to a lightly-flowered surface and knead for about 1 minute, forming it into a ball. Cover with plastic wrap and let stand for 30 minutes.  3. Heat the over to 200Â° with a baking sheet set on the rack. Heat a medium cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat until very hot. Meanwhile, cut the dough into 3 equal pieces and form each piece into a ball. On a lightly floured surface, roll one of the pieces of dough out into a very thin circle (it should be less than 1/16 inch thick and about 6 1/2 inches in diameter). Using a fork, prick the dough 7 or 8 times. Lightly brush one side of the dough with olive oil and sprinkle it lightly with salt.  4. Transfer round of dough, with the oiled side down, to the hot skillet and reduce heat to medium; cook until surface is covered with golden to dark-brown speckles, about 1 to 2 minutes on each side. If the flatbread begins to burn, lower the heat and continue to cook.  5. Remove bread from skillet and transfer to the baking sheet in the oven. Repeat the rolling and cooking process with the remaining 2 pieces of dough.  6. Cut the bread into wedges with a pizza wheel or sharp knife, and serve warm."
3216,4088894,2004-07-30,"Well, this weekend is going to me quadrupally special for me: Not only is it a full moon tomorrow night, but it is also a blue moon (the second full moon in a calendar month). Then on Sunday it is Lammas (one of the eight Sabbats in the Wheel of the Year) AND my first wedding anniversary!  Yes, one year ago, Dale & I both stood up in front of a bunch of our friends & family to say words along the lines of ""I do"". Where has the time gone? It's quite literally flown by so fast that I can scarcely believe it. It certainly doesn't feel like a year already. It was odd enough last month when I realised that my best friend, Sarah, had been married a whole year (there was a whole spate of weddings last summer, you see!) & now it's MY turn. I can honestly say it's been fantastic so far, but people keep asking how it feels to be married & all I can say is that it doesn't really feel any different to us than we did before! We were already living together & both knew we wanted to spend the rest of our lives together - it was just a case of formalising it & making it legal. Perhaps I feel a little more secure now, but other than that, it's exactly the same. Just as well I was happy enough before, isn't it?  So, Dale & I are returning to the hotel where the deed was done, for dinner & an overnight stay, with breakfast in bed, to celebrate.  Anyway, other than our anniversary, I have the other important celebration to think about - Lammas! A little information is possibly called for here, I suppose. Lammas is the first of the three harvest festivals (the fifth of the year as a whole) & is generally held on or around 1st August. It celebrates the harvesting of the first crops as well as the first fruition of projects begun at the start of the year - we reap as we sow. It is also known as Lughnassadh (pronounced Loo-nah-sah) - the feast of the God, Lugh, who is sacrificed as he is cut down with the corn & reborn as the bread, providing food for all.  Some traditional associations are:  Traditional Foods:  Apples, Grains, Breads and Berries.  Herbs and Flowers:  All Grains, Grapes, Heather, Blackberries, Sloe, Crab Apples, Pears.  Incense:  Aloes, Rose, Sandalwood. Sacred GemstoneCarnelian.  Special Activities:  As summer passes, many Pagans celebrate this time to remember its warmth and bounty in a celebrated feast shared with family or Coven members. Save and plant the seeds from the fruits consumed during the feast or ritual. If they sprout, grow the plant or tree with love and as a symbol of your connection with the Lord and Lady. Walk through the fields and orchards or spend time along springs, creeks, rivers, ponds and lakes reflecting on the bounty and love of the Lord and Lady.  I've never been much of a one to go in for long rituals, so the one I use (when I use one at all) goes along these lines:   On the Altar:  Large beeswax candle Lengths of green & red cord Wine, bread & honey   The Ritual:  Cleanse and cast the circle. Light the beeswax candle. Knot the piece of red cord and pass it over the candle, circling the base. Think of all that is passing and the sacrifices you have made. Give them up freely as you pass the red cord over the flame. Knot the green cord and pass it over the candle to lie on top of the red cord. This represents the achievements which will be built on your sacrifices â your harvest.  Consecrate the wine and drink in honour of the Sun's power and your own achievements. Consecrate the bread and honey, and take them to the four corners saying: 'This is my offering; This is my sacrifice.' (start at the North then move round the circle deosil) Spread the honey on the bread. Eat and drink, communing with the season, saving some to put into the Earth as an offering later. Close the circle.  I don't think I'll be performing a ritual this year, so I'll probably just spend some time outside, somewhere green, & meditate a while instead - the Lord & Lady seem to be happy enough with that arrangement, so it should be more than enough.  I wish you all a special Blue Moon celebration & a fruitful harvest this Lammas! Blessings, Mab."
3217,4088894,2004-07-30,"Well, I've never run a blog before, but I guess a wee introduction would probably be the best place to start, so here goes:  I'm a 27 year old married female who happens to be a practicing solitary Witch & have been for around 13 years now. I've forged my own Path along the way; a Path I call Simple Witchery. So, what does that mean, exactly? Well, I boil everything down to its barest components & take out all the extraneous bumf & hooha, so that what is left is the barest of essentials. I don't go in for big, fancy rituals & ceremonies - most of my magick takes place in the kitchen or the bathroom & is very firmly based in the mundane - it's a part of my everyday life, not something I do on the weekends or a couple of evenings a month. I am very much interested in spellcraft - the science of magick - & also the artsy-craftsy side of it (ie making things to use as part of a spell, such as poppets, amulets, talismans, or just the little things like a bag to put all the components in!). I'm also very interested in the use of herbs in healing.  Outside of my Craft interests, I am an avid reader - everything from horror to fantasy, comedy to biography - I just devour them all! I also spend a fair bit of time writing, not just calligraphy (which I love), but I edit a small local Pagan newsletter (Triptych) & also write a regular column for Dragonswood magazine. Music plays a huge part in my life - my husband plays guitar & sings, while I just sing - we spend a lot of time listening to rock & metal music (our favourite band is Dream Theater). Movies are another shared interest - just about any genre you care to name is represented in our DVD collection.  And that's a brief introduction to ME. No doubt as I write more, more will be revealed..."
3218,4088894,2004-08-20,"Well, I've attempted, several times lately, to make an entry, but for some reason, the net seems to see me as the enemy lately & keeps booting me off without complying with my meagre requests!  Karl has begun work on the site construction for Lone Witch, so Esk & I will be getting together with him tomorrow night to work on the design & layout some.  I can hardly wait to see these first stages complete & then move onto a working version so we can get started!  It's going to take quite a while to transfer all the existing files from the old Yahoo group to the new site & get all the existing members over there & settled in.  Then we have to wait for the new members to start arriving...  Watched aprogramme on the Aberdeen Witch Trials this evening.  Although it didn't give much more information than I already knew, it was quite interesting & I've recorderd it for a pal in America who has a connection to Aberdeen & the whole Witch Trials thing (that was how we met online, actually!).  I think he'll find it quite absorbing...  In between all this, I've begun a new regime - in an attempt to shift this last half stone to get to my target weight, I have started a fitness routine.  I originally decided on swimming twice a week & visiting the gym once a week too.  Unfortunately, my gym plans have been scuppered for now, as they aren't giving any more inductions for the equipment till the new term starts (so I'll have to wait a few weeks till all the students get back).  Anyway, I've been swimming twice this week & have realised that the only reason anyone LIKES exercising is that it feels so good when you STOP!  I never realised how blissful a shower could feel - sinking into a bath is usually my choice, but after a hard sesh in the pool, the shower feels like paradise!  ""So, why don't you just use magick to get rid of the flab, Mab?"" I hear the cynics cry!  Well, it's like this; I've always held that real Witchcraft is knowing when to use magick & when not to.  For instance, if I decided to just try & magick away the weight it couldn't work - you have to put in the effort.  Magick always takes the path of least resistance, so if you cast a spell to lose weight but then pig out, it ain't gonna work!  If, however, you put in the effort, cut down on the fat & do some exercise, then cast a spell to help keep you focused, enhance your willpower & boost your energy, then you'd be onto a winner.  This is exactly what I've done & let me tell you, I'm feeling better than I've felt in a VERY long time.  I'm already feeling more energetic & although my arms ache from all the swimming, I'm already feeling healthier & satisfied that I'm doing what I can to get into good shape.  Although it doesn't half get you knackered!"
3219,4088894,2004-08-13,"Well, that was my first week back at work & I discover the senior secretary is pregnant, so come February, I'll have even MORE work to contend with! Been rushed off my feet all week long & am SO glad it's Friday night now & I have the whole weekend at my disposal. So, what shall I do with my time?  Well, this Witch has decided she's getting a little flabby & could do with some toning up, so I've decided to check out the gym facilities at the University along with the pool there. I'll be dragging poor Esk up there to check it out with me too. Have decided on an action plan: I will swim twice a week on Tuesday & Thursday nights after work, & go to the gym on Saturdays. That way I'll be nice & trim by Yule & able to wear a slinky little number for New Year - HURRAH!  ""So, why don't you just use Magick to fight your flab, Mab?"" I hear the cynics sneer! Well, I've always thought that Witchcraft is about knowing WHEN to use magick & when NOT to. The thing about Magick is that it follows the path of least resistance, so if you're not willing to put in the work, you'll get nowhere very fast! So, I'll go to the gym &amp; work my butt off & maybe part way through, when I'm getting bored & sick of it, I'll do a little something to strengthen my resolve & give my willpower an extra boost - THAT'S the most effective way to do it (from my own past experience, that is!). Plus, this way I get to buy myself a new swimming costume & a cute little work-out outfit too - LOL!  I'm going to ask Karl about doing a session on the new site tomorrow night too. I'd like to see how we're progressing & get an estimate on when things should be ready to test out. Reckon Esk will want to come round for that too - we're both just so excited about the whole project!  Then on Sunday, I think I shall have a rest - kick back & watch a movie on our new wide-screen TV & shiny new DVD player with Dale, & generally do nothing much at all. I reckon I deserve a rest after the week I've had!  Another thing today was the discussion over at Lone Witch about it being Friday 13th - we're any of us superstitious about it or did we feel more unlucky on that day? The resounding answer, overall, was a big ""NO!"". Personally, I've always rather LIKED Friday 13th! I've always been rather fond of the number 13 anyway & Friday is practically the weekend, so what's NOT to like? So, I've never felt more unlucky on Friday 13th than any other day - I see no reason for it.  And I'm not afraid to walk under ladders either - LOL!"
3220,4088894,2004-08-06,"So, Esk came round this evening & we discussed our plans for the new Lone Witch site with my hubby & bruv-in-law, just throwing around our options on how to include everything we want to be part of the new site. Ended up with both of them saying they'd have a go to see what they could come up with, so we'll have a choice to look at - hurrah!  It's all getting rather exciting now, knowing that pretty soon we'll have a site to call our own. Of course, all this means that we will effectively be going ""back to school"" to learn how to maintain the site & sort out all those little problems that are bound to crop up. Really, it's going to have to be the simplest possible format as we're both complete thickies when it comes to the net (kind of strange that 2 such techno-inepts should decide to build their own site!).  Anyway, after being friends for 15 years now, Esk & I are discovering that we really DO think alike & are coming up with the same ideas at the same time & kind of freaking out the boys a little by completing each other's sentences & speaking at the same time. Well, after that amount of time in each other's company, I suppose this kind of thing has to be expected really. We've started looking at styles of layouts & ideas for artwork now - by the time we're done, this site is going to be HUGE!!!  Better think about getting some sleep as tomorrow will be a very busy day in Aberdeen - the International Children's Festival is on, it's Tartan Day, the International Market will be there, the circus is in town along with the God Squad down at the beach. And Esk & I are also going on one of the Haunted Aberdeen tours tomorrow afternoon, so all in all, a pretty packed day full stop!"
3221,4088894,2004-08-03,"Well, I've registered a domain name for Lone Witch & building of the site will commence as of tonight!  Esk & I have wanted to do this for quite some time, but now that the domain name is registered, it feels a lot more 'real' - like it's actually going to happen at long last.  No longer will be have to put up with the finicky Ya-hell!  We'll be setting up forums, files, calander, database, etc, & it will be all-singing, all-dancing!  A whole new beginning for the Lone Witch Group - we'll be able to expand & do anything we please with it.  I'm so excited I've practically been jumping up & down non-stop since last night!  It'll be a hard slog, but worth it in the long run, I reckon..."
3222,4088894,2004-08-03,"Well, after a lovely weekend celebrating so much, here I am, back at my computer once more. The Lammas/Mabon issue of Dragonswood magazine is now on the shelves in our local Pagan shop (I've had to buy a spare copy to send to my mother as my 1st column appears in it &, to my delight & surprise, is credited on the front cover!). So, now I have to begin work on the NEXT column in time for the Samhain/Yule issue. Well, I say 'being', it just needs proof reading & tightening up a bit & it's good to go!  I've updated the Lone Witch sister site  urlLink http://www.lonewitch.blinks.net/  & also my own personal site  urlLink http://www.mabon-online.blinks.net/  ready for Mabon which is the next holiday on the Wheel of the Year, & now I must get cracking on the Mabon issue of Triptych so I can get it on the shelves at Kabbalah in plenty of time.  Kabbalah is our local Pagan shop, run by Elaine & has many wondrous goodies for the discerning Witch in Aberdeen. Actually, its the only shop of its type in the city at the moment & it has everything from herbs & incense to books & altar tools. Not only that, but the staff are wonderful too - always ready for a friendly chat on any subject under the sun. I remember interviewing Elaine for an early issue of Triptych (back when it didn't have a name & was just the Lone Witch Newsletter) & she said she didn't think they'd do an online shop at all, but now, things have changed, & she has a lovely little site for ordering all the things you might want online:  urlLink http://www.kabbalahshop.co.uk/   Lastly of all, I have prepared for the coming Sabbat (which is my namesake) by creating a whole new look for myself. Gone are the long blonde locks - replaced by a short, choppy crop with which I am delighted. So, now that my head is no longer bogged down by the weight of all that hair, perhaps I shall be inspired to write something really special for Triptych!"
8926,3673762,2004-06-25,"I brought them both home with me this evening. (Technically last night, since it is now well past midnight.)  Pippi was waiting for me in the children's section of my local Big Chain bookstore. I had sat at the kiddie table to flip through Ed Emberley's drawing books. Pippi caught my eye from a discarded stack of books across the table, when I paused to sip my Starbucks coffee. I loved her when I was a kid, and my hand automatically reached out for her cheery face on the book's cover.  I had forgotten she is the strongest girl in the world, has her own house, and is an orphan. Just like ME! I'm tempted to dye my (graying) hair red, but I'll compromise by wearing pig tails now and then.  Pippi had me reminiscing past joys, so I sprung for a compilation CD of Kitaro's music from the 70s and 80s. I've lusted for that album since a boyfriend played the cassette version in his truck for me, at his farm in Grand Forks, North Dakota, in 1988. We discussed romance to Kitaro's pulsing accompaniment. The music stayed with me, the boyfriend didn't, thank goodness.  Better go beddie-bye before I spill too much information here.  Love ya, Pippi."
8927,3673762,2004-06-23,"With the death of my brother last month, I have no immediate family. I had been trying to call him, to wish him Happy Easter and Birthday in April, then to see how he was in May. I kept leaving messages.  Not until that day in May that a nurse called to tell me he had died a few hours earlier, did I know he had moved twice this year. I try not to be angry...""If only someone had called me back to let me know he had moved, I could have talked to him one last time...."" I immediately got on a plane and flew to where he was. I buried him near my parents. Thatâs about all I have the emotional stamina to say about it tonight.  With his death all my immediate family are gone.  So for a while I holed up. I read, wrote, and wallowed. It makes no sense to me that I should be w/o family at such a young age. I've done everything right as a loyal and compassionte being, and it's no joke that most people who meet me like me. I like people too, hence my profile, ""loner who likes people."" (More on that in a future post.)  And as I've learned well, each time there is death near me, a friend or two or three, will drop from the radar. I've had enough practice not to take this personally. Meanwhile, others have stepped forward in unexpected support and generosity. The last two afternoons I was treated to coffee and chat by new acquaintances. I doubt these will become serious friendships, but I am glad to learn once again that when some fall away, either in death or because they don't want to be around a person who is hurting, there are many angels willing to step in.  I almost gave up again. I decided to become a hermit, far beyond my usual loner self. Yet that pebble of courage that always grinds into my heel when I take a step kept prodding me. For a week, at least, I'm trying to play in the friendship game again.  A funny part of my coffee dates with these two women was that I listened to them talk about their love lives. Hearing their joys and sorrows, and offering ideas as asked, made me feel alive and hopeful; for love, even lost love, is the breath of life. We talked little of my situation. For me, that was a relief; a mental vacation. I told them so.  My life is changing. I have always been a loner. I want to be different than I've been in that regard, but I think the programming is hard wired. I prefer it.  This book perks me up when I start telling people off in my mind for what my emotional center registers as abandonment:  Anyway: The Paradoxical Commandments:  Finding Personal Meaning in a Crazy World   by Kent M. Keith  People will leave in various ways. I'm a true friend anyway. Others stay, and love me no matter how life turns. I am grateful."

I believe in the afterlife, I sense you watching over me in your way...I hear you laughing your silly laugh and saying, ""Be happy, Baby Girl. Don't worry about me!""     You suffered a lot with heart disease, cancer and other illnesses. You had looked so forward to age 65 so you could get your Social Security and still work part time without being penalized. But Death had other ideas, and took you in your 65th year.     I miss you every day. I saw families laughing and smiling today and wondered, ""Why can't that be me? Why do I have to be an orphan at such a young age?"" There's no answer.     So I'll follow your advice, and continue to live the happiest life I know how. I went to church, then out to lunch with those people. After that I made a bowl for the Empty Bowls charity event this Fall.

The Oscar-winning film, released last year, was based on the true story of Aileen Wuornos, a serial killer in Florida in the 80s and 90s.  What does this have to do with Google? Photos of Aileen. Her famous, chilling, brown-eyed stare was captured by actor Charlize Theron in the movie, and it was  scary . Wanting to know if the effect was movie magic, or real life, I looked up Wuornos on Google.  After reading several articles on her, I clicked the Images feature just above the search text. Let me tell you, I was not disappointed. Take a look:  urlLink   Brown Eyes      See Rome and Die  Who said that? Iâll have to search later. But Aileen inspired me to remember the quote. Really though, want to see all manner of photos of the Eternal Cityâeverything from Bubbaâs vacation to pro shots for tourist publications? Type âRomeâ (quotes not needed) in Googleâs search box, click Images above the box, and pages of photos of ruins and rocks from various decades, maps, old documents, and happy cappuccino drinkers are yours to ogle. Take a look:  urlLink  Rome     Ogle for the Dead  Thatâs not for me, but I suppose if you searched Jack the Ripper, youâd see shots of Mary Kelly, his most gruesome kill.  My brother died suddenly last month, which is why I havenât been here in a while. A friend told me after Iâd buried my brother, that itâs now possible to arrange everything via the Internet. I told my friend, âNo way, there are laws and agenciesâ¦.â He explained a friend of his who was terminally ill paid in advance for it all, and it was âdirt cheapâ (pardon pun) to the tune of $600 USD, including picking up the body. As Iâd just paid thousands, I found the idea appealing. Iâll leave it to you to search for that one, and I donât recommend looking for images. Unless they are of âHappy Acresâ.   Ogle and Goggle with Google  So many images, so little time. To add to your viewing and surfing pleasure, click the Images item on your usual searches. Along with the textual information, youâll gain a visual. I just typed in âTuxedo Catâ and I can tell you none of those cats are as cute as my darling. I better get busy with the digital camera.  If youâre in the mood to surf, search for âgoggleâ images. Wild.  Note: Rarely, clicking Images doesnât execute the search, and you have to click Search after clicking Images.   Coming soon: Touching, dancing, and playing lab rat with Google ."

8933,3673762,2004-08-04,"Today's mail held a large envelope from The White House. Inside was a certificate signed by George Bush, President of the United States:  ""The United States of America honors the memory of (my brother). This certificate is awarded by a grateful nation in recognition of devoted and selfless consecration to the service of our country in the Armed Forces of the United States.""  I have been surprised how quickly the gov't has taken care of details pertaining to my brother's death in May. I find myself wondering if this is because we're at war. Also, I didn't know family members got these certificates--we didn't get one for my dad, that I recall or have found in the family papers, but he didn't die in a military facility, so perhaps that's the difference.  I am thinking prayerfully of other families who have lost relations, and get these certificates. It is so sad to get mail for dead people.  I never thought I'd be without family at such a young age. Time to write!  I have a great life, despite the losses. Missing my family compels me to live fully."

10206,3958944,2004-07-17,"First off, I decided to make a blogger account because everyone else I know is either using livejournal or xanga, and quite frankly, I don't want to be like everyone else.      Secondly, I've quite possibly had the best week ever.    As of last Sunday, my mom and I have been house sitting at her bosse's house due to the fact that they're in Utah for a softball tournament, and the two dogs that they have need to be taken care of.  I figured this would be a good time to invite Allie over, since I hadn't seen her in the first two weeks she was in AZ because I'm an idiot.  Here's the basic run down of week:    Monday - Nothing too interesting.  The oh-so original sit on your ass and do nothing day.    Tuesday - First day with Allie.  We went out to an Italian resturant (the name of which escapes me at the moment) first, and then headed out to AZ Mills, where we spent about two hours, despite the fact that we only went into two stores.    Wednesday - Movie night.  We rented Butterfly Effect, which was suprisingly good.  Since when could Kutcher act?  After the movie, Allie and I sat and talked for two-ish hours.  Needless to say, that was much fun.    Thursday/Friday - See Monday.    Today - Woke up, walked the dogs, and then got ready for a whole day with Allie.  Picked her up around eleven, and then went out for breakfast at Dennies.  Afterwards, we went to the mall again.  However, this time we went to Superstition Springs instead of AZ Mills.  I think she was mad at me for a bit when I bought her a book she wanted, even though she had the money to pay for it, though.  I do what I can.  We had planned on going to Polar Ice; but with Dennies and the mall, there was no time to get there for public skating.  Instead, we came back to the house and swam for bit.  Then I got to spend some quality time with my one and only until she had to leave.    Now I have to wait until Wednesday to see her again, and she leaves on Thursday... I really don't know what I'm going to do without her.  There'll be next summer, though.  I'll be heading out to Europe with Allie, my 8th grade social studies teacher, and a group of some other kids that I don't know for three weeks.  That's still a long way away, though.  Ah well, I'll find some way to last until then."
19981,3016686,2004-07-05,"BLUE NILE   finally  has a new CD ready! It's been  ten years  since the last.  The new one is called  High  and is due out on August 30 on Sanctuary Records.

Well, mom's bf didn't like the cat and mom decided she didn't want it anymore so instead of working to get it a new home, she dumped it at the Animal Shelter where it will probably be put down or traumatized further for being abandoned. It makes me so mad.  You know, mankind domesticated an animal, there was an implicit promise that we would take care of the animal as we made it impossible for that species to take care of itself sufficiently, especially after we declaw (or whatever) the poor thing. For me, a pet is like a member of the family. God, you know, it makes me wonder if I had been a willful child if she woulda dumped me off somewhere. Once you take the responsibility for a living thing, you MUST see it through! I don't care if we are talking about a fricken guppy!

(Terry Pratchett, Interesting Times)  Again, this is quite true. You see it happening all throughout history, exspically in wars where the USA is involved. The guy at the top is always at the rear where he is safe from everything while the footsoldiers are at the front getting shot, stabbed, cut, crushed, burnt, blown to bits, posioned and what have you. And in wars nowadays, the soldiers have to obey the guys above them even though the overmentioned people are totally useless. And at the end of everything, it is those same morons who gets all the glory and honour and medals and Purple Hearts and what not. All this while the people who risked their lives get hurt - even dead! - and they don't get much of anything unless they get wounded, in which case they just get a worthless Purple Heart! Those guys've lost arms and limbs and watch they friends die just to protect their country and the people living there, and when they come back, they get looked down on and spat at by the very people they've laid down their lives for. And this is because the bloody civilians are trying to get the war to stop but they have no idea what goes on in the fields of fire.  Haiz, those poor soldiers...lets now have a moment of slience for the warriors who have fought and have fallen in battle.....  Well, i've sure typed a whole bunch of stuff without intending to. lolz. Yeah whatever. See you around."

You see, it is 10:30 now and in a half an hour, I would be lying soundly in my bed, dreaming whatever it is that I would be dreaming. lolz.  First of all, my little sister enter this National Story Telling Competition, and for some strange reason, actually came in first. After think about this unlikely incident, I have come to a few conclusions: 1)Her school bribed the judges. 2)There was a mixup in the prize department and the top prize was given to them by mistake. 3)She really was that good. O.o Go on, take a wild guess as to which is the correct reason. :P In all likelihood, you would be able to read about her in the newspapers in the days to come, so do keep an eye out. :D  Aww, darn! I'm almost out of time! So here is a quick quote, this time taken from Scott Adams, the author of Dilbert.  "" I don't know why everyone says poverty can't be eliminated. The solution is obvious to me. All it takes is what bankers call the :""miracle of compound interest."" This requires a long-term approach to the problem, but its fairly foolproof if you're patient. All you do is give each poor person a dollar. There are only about 5 billion poor people, so this is quite affordable as a percentage of the worldwide GNP. That dollar is deposited in a special bank account for each of the poor people with the idea that it stays there for generations collection interest. The number of poor people doubles every twenty years, but the value of money doubles every ten years, assuming it is well invested, so the gap will close. In 4000 years, the descendants of the poor people will be allowed to go to the bank and asked for their money. The bank will inform them that the dollar was taken in fees 4000 years ago, and the balance of all their accounts is zero. At this point, the poor people will kill the bankers and steal all the money in the bank, thus ending poverty completely.""  -Scott Adams, The Dilbert Future.  Okay, its now 11. I got to go now, but should come back soon in order to tell you all about the days events. Bye for now."
28947,3739297,2004-08-14,"Hello people! A lots of things has happened in the last few days, and I'm really glad about it! On Friday,  I went to watch ""The Spook Show"" with Mark. A most unexpected person came along too - Renee! I was really surprised that she was there. Anyway, back to the show. ""The Spook Show"" isn't bad to watch...The tricks the magician made were quite predictable, but nonetheless entertaining. There is, of course, always a trick involved, but yet we humans still watch a ""magic"" show to see a trick done well. It is just one of those things that humans do...Even if you have seen lots of magic shows and are able to tell what the next trick's going to be just by looking at the props on stage. :P  After watching the show, I went back home to sleep. Well, duh. Did you expect me to sleep in the streets? Ha.  Well, today we had our mork test on Social Studies and History. I hope that I would do well...I really do...It will show just how good I am....Or how bad I am, depending on how you look at it. lolz.

Try to work harder and score higher next time. And for those who didn't...Weellll, try to harder too. Remember this phrase from dear Mr. Adem, ""I am gifted, so are you!"" You would be able to do well, I'm sure. Just give it everything you've got, and best of luck.  And now the next important thing of the day...So important that it affects the whole nation of Singapore. It's a day of great joy, one in which our country would receive a new leader...If you haven't guessed by now, it is the signing in of our new Prime Minister, Mr. Lee Hsien Loong...Well, I've just told you, so you have gotten it. If you've watched the live telecast of the whole event, I suppose that you would have noticed that Mr. Lee was extremely nervous when he beening sworn in...So nervous that he placed his hand down before it was done! I imagine that he must be so embarrassed! lolz. But, when he came up to deliver his speech, he did it with such grace and tact that even I would be hard-pressed to outdo him....Why are you looking at me like that? Was it something I said? *ahem* Right. I just hope that Mr. Lee would be able to led Singapore on to a bright new future, one where everyone in Singapore would be happy, at ease will themselves, and most of all, rich. :P Lets hope that Mr. Lee would be able to job as good a job as Mr. Goh...Only time will write the story, and history will tell it.  Okay, this is one very long post...I would love to type more, but i have to study for my SS and History test on Saturday.

28949,3739297,2004-08-09,"Ahhh....I've just finished watching Gundam Seed...It's quite a nice show...Gets really touching at the end...So many ppl died...Felt like crying. Those who shouldn't die died, while those who should die also died. As it were. Hard to believe that the almightly Freedom Gundam would be so badly damaged in battle. Really a nice show...The begining is a little boring, but it gets better as it progresses. Long live Gundam Seed!!!  Ahhh, didn't do much today...Spent the whole day watching Gundam Seed. The are a few loopholes though. For example, when the Aegis Gundam attached itself to Strike and blew itself up, how did Kira get to Lucas's house at PLANT? And the ArchAngel...It was able to defend itself so well in the begining of the series...Then, after it was repaired at Orb, its hull could be torn apart by a single missile. lolz. Oh well. :P  Today is National Day!!! Yah!!! I love National Day...Cuz I need not go to school for today and tomorrow. lolz. Try to catch the fireworks, people.

May all your wishes and dreams come true in the following year. :D  As for Mr. Anonymous...Yes, is possible to load your own songs from your computer to your blog. But first you must find a server which allows you upload your song to your site so that it can be played. I'm using Tripod to upload mine. Then you must decide on which file format your want your song to be...I've converted 1000 Words into a Flash file using LAME software. Then by messing around with HTML, I've placed the file into my blog. Yup, that's about it. Yeah. Hope this helps....The URl from which I uploaded the file is  urlLink http://stifler-leonheart.tripod.com/jade-words.swf .  And here is the quote of the day:  Ridcully was to management what King Herod was to the Bethlehem Playgroup Association. His mental approach to it could be visualised as a sort of business flowchart with, at the top, a circle entitled ""Me, who does the telling"" and, connected below it by a line, a large circle entitled ""Everyone else"". -- (Terry Pratchett, The Last Continent)  Yeah, nothing much to type liao.

Alvin Inc. apologies for any inconvenience caused by this lapse in duty. :P  Right! Yesterday, my school celebrated National Day. Mostly what we did was watch the uniformed groups march into the quadrangle, after which we sang the National Anthem. Then the uniformed groups marched off, after which the Girls Brigade performed a complicated drill. They pulled it off quite well, though a few missteps did pop up here and there. I suppose that this is to be expected. After all, they are only human. :P  Now take a wild guess as to what happened next. Yup! Got it in one. We started singing the national day songs. Every year it is the same old story. Every year we do the same thing on National Day. Wonât it ever change? Oh botherâ¦. Anyway, we had our Thanksgiving Festival today. All in all, its not badâ¦Though it got quite boring in parts.  :D The band played really well, in my option.  Shuyi did a great job singing in the choir. I canât even begin to imagine the amount of guts it took for her to stand there and sing like it is nobodyâs business. Nicely done, Shuyi!  Haiz, next week we would be having another mock test...This time it is Social Studies and History...Again! Apparently, the school feels that we aren't good enough at our combined humanities, so they are trying to give us lots of practice before the Prelims and the Os. Haiz...  Another thing I've noticed...Why do we always say ""The school"" this and ""The school"" that when what we really want to say is that the people in charge of the school is the ones who came up with the decision. The school is just a building, a pile of bricks and mortar all placed in a fashion which would allow it to support the weight of all the students. It is not a sentential being. It does not think. So why do we always say that it is the school which came up with the decision? Even I am guilty of doing this. I don't know...I suppose that it is just one of those things.  Okay here is the quote of the day:  In fact, the mere act of opening the box will determine the state of the cat, although in this case there were three determinate states the cat could be in: these being Alive, Dead, and Bloody Furious. -- Schrodinger's Moggy explained (Terry Pratchett, Lords and Ladies)  Ah, too bored liao.

Its one of my favorite songs of all time. And like any most of my favorite songs, it is an FF song. Final Fantasy X-2, to be exect. I just love the way it starts off slow at the begining and builds up to its climax at the ending. Isn't it beautiful? No? Oh well, that's too bad. One man's meat is another's posion, as they say.

Haiz, I've been asking Victor to pass me a little for, say, about two weeks now. And everyday he will say something like, ""Tomorrow, tomorrow! I will bring it!"".

Okay, here is another quote:  It is a universal fact that any innocent comment made by any recently married young member of any workforce is an instant trigger for coarse merriment among his or her older and more cynical colleagues. This happens even if everyone concerned has nine legs and lives at the bottom of an ocean of ammonia on a huge cold planet. Itâs just one of those things.  -Terry Pratchett ( Witches Abroad)  And here is some interesting stuff to know:  Correspondence of Demons to the Seven Deadly Sins (According to Peter Binsfield, a Jesuit, 1589) Lucifer- Pride Mammon- Avarice Asmodeus- Lust Satan- Anger Beelzebub- Gluttony Leviathan- Envy Belphegor- Vanity and Sloth  BTW, did you know that the name Lucifer really mean Bringer of Light? Its kind of strange that such a nice name is changed to mean the same as that of the Devil himself. Well, its a weird world. Truth is usually stranger than fiction.  Ah well, nothing to type anymore.

Does this mean that my anscestors were Nazis, and treated my anscestors horribly, and  as such I should hate myself for my anscestors treatment of...themselves? No, this makes no sence, and I find that these...honestly I can't think of a word to call them... are just trying to get an advantage rom their fore-father's strife. And as we all know, the Africans wouldn't even think about selling their brethren into slavery... the Europeans just swept over and conquored the place... I hate people sometimes ... they can be stupid, and naustalgic. And another thing, why is it considered rascist for me to say the ""N"" word, but they can call me a ""Cracker"" all they want? GOD!!! It just doesn't make ANY SENCE!!! You know, there was a guy who was walking in the Bronx at night with his friend, when two black guys woth knives started walking towards him. His buddy, the smart one, ran. He, however, felt it would be rascist if he ran. His body was found in a dumpster, behind a bar. Funny..."
47030,3371255,2004-05-17,"I find it Ironic that our society is willing to accept blame for the ills of the world...and from those who poison it! If you have ever been on the west coast of the US, you will find that many of the people actually SIDE WITH THE TERRORISTS! WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU THINKING?????? If I came up to someone, and punched them in the face, would they blame themselves? NO! They would punch me right back! You know there are SERIOUS problems with a society when they feel that they are to blame for EVERY LITTLE THING! 2 1/2 years ago, we had a 2 planes fly into the World Trade Center...killing 3000+ people, and now, all we can think about is a few ""Tortured"" Iraqi soldiers? As I recall, those who died in the Trade Center were not exactly beligerant...they were TRADING. but let's not even mention the men and women in the towers, crying out in vain as fire consumes them, or those who jumped out from 80+ stories onto the pavement to escape such a fate... let's talk about 3 ENEMY SOLDIERS who were ""discrased""...and ofcourse they were never planning to bomb our military bases in Iraq, never ever ever ever trying to KILL our troops...My thinking is, if you are going to attempt to attack those who are liberating you, then you had better be ready to face the consequences. Let my rant be a lesson to society... for many of the ills in the world, we are not to blame. We are the ones who prevent the ills of the world...or at the least TRY to.           *cough*France,Germany*cough* Grrr..."

47566,743739,2004-08-02,"So let me see how much of my trip I remember; at the same time recording it for future generations.   Thursday (July 22)  All day spent traveling.  We ended up in Flagstaff AZ, the most expensive hotel city in American.  Ok, probably not, but when did the truth matter here?  Friday  Hey look, another driving day, but this time with flair.  After buying cheap gas in Kingman AZ, we headed north to see Hoover Dam.  This was also our first time to drive through a security checkpoint.  Apparently we didn't look like we intended to blow up the dam, and was allowed to drive across.  This was also the day to see Death Valley.  All I can say is appropriate name. Hey, did you know there are no roads going across central California?  Not even minor ones like we guessed there had to be.  So, we got to go north all the way past Yosemite and take a road that looks nice and straight on the map.  On the map.  Stupid map.  So its 11 pm and we are winding through curves going up and down mountains amazed that we haven't passed a town with a gas station in a long time.  a long time.  And yes, for those of you who can guess where this is leading, I can now say that I have been stranded for 2+ hours in a national forest in California.  Special thanks to Daniel Lions for helping us out there.  Saturday Ok, so really that last think carried over into Saturday and we got to Oakland at 9 in the morning.  The baseball game was an afternoon game so we took a short nap and then proceeded to Network Associates Coliseum.  Yes, the stadium is as awful as you have heard.  However it was nice to see other A's fans.  Also it was a 6-2 Oakland win, with Kotsey hitting 2 home runs and Dotel pitching the ninth (three straight strike outs).  More importantly, I am now a 1989 World Series Champion and I have the ring to prove it.  Take that, San Fran Giants.  Oh, also I burnt my head during this game.  Not Fun.  Sunday Church at Harvest something in Fremont CA.  Good praise and worship.  The pastor delivered a good message, but is younger and still needs some polish.  All and All a great experience. After church we headed over to Fishermens wharf.  Pier 39 I believe.  Let me tell you, I have never seen so many shops crammed into such a small space and the crab was amazing.  Yes those of you that I talk to often will hear about the crab, then hear about the crab, and possibly hear about the crab some more.  OH, I almost forgot.  We took the Bay Bridge to get to San Fran (where the wharf is).  Awesome experience, out of the three bay bridges we took, this was my favorite.  Of course I am bias by memories of the quake hitting this bridge during the 1989 World Series (which I won). After fishermen's wharf, we drove over the Golden Gate Bridge.  This was nice, but the fog was heavy.  This kinda made it cool, but also made it impossible to see the top of the cables supporting the bridge. Heading north, we crossed back over the third northern bridge that I can't remember the name of.  Awesome.  This bridge was huge.  Yeah, thats all I'm going to say.  Monday If I was as cool as Willie Nelson, I would sing about being on the road again.  Instead I will just relate that we drove through Sequoia National Park, giant trees and nice mountains, on the way to Phoenix.  Another late night as we arrived at the hotel at 3am, I believe.  Tuesday Tuesday I slept.  Oh yeah and ate TCBY yogurt, losing that was the worst thing that ever happened to Stillwater.  Wednesday Umm yeah, more sleeping and TCBY that night.   Thursday Ill let you use your imagination, and yes, more TCBY.  Friday Mexico Day.  Yes, a quick jaunt into Mexico.  Also we saw the cacti at Saguaro National Park.  And driving, ended the day in Las Cruces New Mexico.  Saturday So driving through NM is boring.  The day ended in Amarillo Tx.  Some good bar b q and TCBY led us into bed time.  Oh yes, also I got to listen to the A's beating the rangers on rangers radio, that was fun.  Sunday Trinity Fellowship Church in Amarillo.  Rodger Hodges church, and if you don't know who Rodger Hodges, shame on you.  BTW Martin, he is the worship leader there.  So of course great praise and worship, Good message, then a 5 hour drive home.   So all in all it was a great trip.  Phoenix was a disappointment, my only plans were to see Bill Heaton, a local youth minister I once worked for, but our schedules never worked out for that to happen.  I must say it is great to be back home.  Even though the month started with two youth camps, only one was with ""MY"" group =), so I'm starting to feel separated from them (not necessarily saying that is bad).  Well, goodnight and remember, same bat time, same bat channel. (the really sad thing is that I continue that joke even though I doubt the target reads this.)"

What does this day have over any other day of the school year? I say there are only three instances where the day is different: 1. any day before a holiday 2. the last day of school 3. the day of an exam or report card. Why would anyone think the first day of school as an exciting day. It signals the start of going back to school for 180, or less, days. To me the first day of school is just like a Monday.

I welcome Death's soothing gaze,  The metal He binds around my neck,  Is the most comforting feeling,  Of which I never want to be unbound."

105336,3670229,2004-06-28,"Ok, I'm gonna write this one in english, just in case a fellow American comes here.  I have seen the last movie of Michael Moore yesterday but before commenting directly on that I would like to talk about a converstation I had Saturday night with some American friends. In Seattle, most people I know and see are ""liberals"" and so they definitely want to get rid of Bush in November election. Hence, they were telling me things like ""I don't know if I am gonna see this movie, I know already that Bush is a complete asshole etc..."". I imagine they don't want to hear again about some of the stories the film talks about, like the 2000 election and Bush's ""coup"". And they said they don't think this movie was going to change anything on the way people are going to vote in November.  Then, I came to see that movie the day after (yesterday), and I must say I don't think they were right about the movie. I think it can definitely change the way one sees Bush, and the American political system as a whole, also. I was really hurt by that movie, and I am not a particularly sensible person. I already knew of many facts the movie talks about (like the Carlyle group or BinLaden's and Bush's families relationships). I had seen, when I was still in France, a documentary on that, which was more documented and precise than Moore's movie but much colder and far less moving. But Farenheit 9/11 is not only about facts, even if it states the most brutal ones, it is about men in war, men that decide of wars, and men that actually do war, basically the young and poor unemployed people of the United-States.  It reminds me of this Bob Dylan song ( urlLink Masters of War ), which seems to be fairly naive when you listen to the lyrics. Go and see Moore's movie, and you will find those lyrics are far from naive ...  Finally, before seeing that movie, I did not understand why it has won the ""Palme d'Or"" at last Cannes Festival, now that I've seen it, I definitely understand the decision of the jury. When a film can move you as this one has moved me, it deserves that kind of prizes and that many many people go and see it."

Okay wishful thinking on the last one, but I'm allowed to dream. Gabe sent me an email :D :D he misses me, I'm excited. Anyway, my friend Carol is in New York, and the terror alert there is red now... and I'm a little paranoid. Kinda creepy, one friend is across the world and the other across the country and we have a red terror alert, not good. But my friend Collin is now home safe and sound for good. I've spent the past two nights doing nothing at his house, it's always good. Music in the park is tonight and I'm going with the girls. Alex maybe too. I'm not really in the mood to go yet tho... Hopefully later, we will see. The scabs on my feet are all better, I'm really glad. I have some beautiful scars instead tho. Justine got pictures back from the yearbook retreat and Grafitti. They are really cute! I'll post them when I get a chance. I love my friends, we are so cute!

118234,2938302,2004-06-08,"Been feeling moody ever since I came back from my doctor's appointment on Wednesday. My eyes are getting from bad to worst. Most shocking news that the doctors told me..my retinals are weak, there is a very high chance of getting retinal detachment. So I asked the doctor what could be done to prevent this from happening. The doctor then told me to go back on 7 July 2004 to see another doctor who specialised in retinal detachments to decide if it is advisable to go for an op to prevent it from happening. Upon hearing that, I lost all my mood by hey I know retinal detachment is not really rare. I know it happens to people like me who has high mypoia but you can't help feeling worried abt it because its my EYES that I'm talking about here. And if you have been to see an eye doctor before you will know how terrible it feels to have those strong bright lights shining right into your eyes. Its just so..so..glaring and you have to follow the instructions and its so tedious..""look at my right ear..look upper right, extreme right,..bottom right.."" all these instructions I can even memorise them. And its not just doing one time on each eye. I have to do two times for each eye..and worst still sometimes more than that. Yea I know I got to be patient, but its really glaring and painful.

Haven't been one before so I was really amazed by the performance. All the clowns, dogs playing soccer and the cowboys with the whip etc made me went wowowowowowo...ahahha  My student cancelled her tuition today so I had a chance to sleep in on a Sunday morning..its been ages since I last did that. slept till 12 and woke up with a bad headache..haha..after my late breakfast I started to read..I've got to finish my books from the library first before I can start on my newly acquired book from the bookshop on Saturday. I've got the book ""The Present"" by Spencer Johnson..the same guy who wrote ""Who Moved My Cheese"" I like that book very much. Not really because I learnt from it but rather I'm impressed with how the author made one understand the meaning of life with simple things like Cheese and Mice. It was for the first time I could really relate things in books to life :) I seldom read non-fiction books. I'm a sucker for novels...yea..give me all the novels and love stories..I can finish them all in a weekend like today. Everytime when I read, I always dream that I don't have to work and just stay at home and read non-stop how good will tat be!!  Anyway, I haven't been going to the gym recently because of the bad cold and all the work that's piling up. Feel damn guilty manz..I betta start going again. Meanwhile, I will just continue reading and reading and reading and reading.  oh yea if you are reading this, do you have any good books to recommend? I've got some borders gift card and I WANT TO GET A NEW BOOK AGAIN!!!!   hahahahaha"
129573,3424020,2004-05-22,"all my relatives were quite proud of when i decided to stop the nasty habit. but i have definitely felt the need to relieve myself, and since i have quit growing pot, smoking seems to be the easiest, legal way to pursue my human drug abuse behavior. 1st fag - things tend to increase in complexity and the always present feeling of strangeness within me is getting stronger. sometimes i like to use the notion of being out of sync with reality.  currently my diploma thesis fills every hour of my day, even when i am not writing. it is about dsp algorithms realized with dedicated floating point hardware, and the goal is to do it as generic as possible in a hdl of my choice. although through most of my university time vhdl has been the dominant hdl, verilog has been present since the early 80s, however the inflexibility quickly led me back to vhdl. my field of interest can be described by hardware/software systems engineering, and considering my grades i am a first class hardware geek. One of my dreams has always been this one big bang scientific thesis to end my studies and begin my diversified work in a renowned high tech company. dreams tend to fulfill themselves the way they want, they develop their own personality along the way.  2nd fag - when i did the necessary research for my thesis i skimmed through every possibly related book in the library of our institute. needless to say i read the majority of them already during the past 3 years. because one of my co-workers is a registered ieee member he has web access to all scientific papers related to computer science. this was the material i desperately needed: thousands of papers directly dealing with floating point hardware. concisely presented, fascinating material - i already envisioned my big bang thesis.  3rd fag - now what could possibly irritate me in a way so that i start smoking after all this time? it is my personal insight that with my current scientific knowledge i wont ever be able to produce a thesis competing with the papers i have read on ieee. i always experienced that mankind's knowledge was hard to grasp as a whole, however now, trying to implement the already existing mathematical facts into high performance silicon, it just seems impossible. along the way of this perception process i must have lost my motivation and now deadlines concerning my thesis are closing in and i am thinking of packing in on my scientific career. metal bands like amon amarth have strengthened me, but now their lyrics raise the wish to just run off into the woods and live like a human being is meant to live - hunting for food, basking under the blue sky, not fearing death as it is the natural effect of life.  4th fag - i am 23 now and when i just continue my life the way i did, the feeling to be out of sync with reality will inescapably increase. science and politics are more connected than i originally anticipated. every society tries to breed a scientific elite to prevail in future conflicts. perhaps all these new opinions of mine evolved by reading ""The Selfish Gene"" by Richard Dawkins which explores the relatively new field of memetics. every idea, every opinion, every kind of art represents a meme spreading itself throughout the human race infesting our brains. the ultimate impetus of such memes is, like genes, domination through reproduction. in my opinion the ongoing search in every human being for a sense in life is obstructed by the complexity of the currently circulating memes. when every meme occupies a certain amount of brain capacity according to its complexity, then the individual search for truth is somewhat limited. the more we allow foreign memes to infest our brains the more we adopt to foreign truths making them our own."

130038,4094511,2004-07-30,"There are funnier things in life than those that last comics stand with. The real joke of living, is getting along. Rodney King, is not my hero, as so I hope he is not yours. His message, however a ringing bell in the backs of our ears, just behind the eardrum. The bell begins to take shape at birth, and eventually in life, as the Liberty Bell it cracks. Why can't we all just get along? Honestly, why?  I am not a genius, though my IQ argues this with me. Not that, yet also not a moron. Yes, I claim to be a fool, but that is a birth right. I can easily see why we do not get along, will not get along, and cannot get along. We have different ideas of love, religion, philosophy, art, entertainment, and even pet peeves o'plenty. This in itself is not such a bad thing. It creates our diversity, which in many ways simply just makes life all the more interesting. We, however feel this blustering, ecumenical need to trample, crucify, and destroy the feelings of others.  Scenario: You think that love does not exist. You want to live you life and bed whomever, whenever, no strings attached. This does not give you the right to approach in desire to obstruct the life of someone who believes in love, and is in love. That being said, you figure that everybody should feel as you do towards the idea of love, so in turn you are doing this ""lover"" a favor by destroying his hopes. You spoon feed your conscious on empty words from a bad episode on Beverly Hills 90210, or some sleazy soap opera. Well, maybe is life were rehearsed, edited, shot for time, and scored you would be doing us a favor. Ultimately, however life is not a movie. If it were, might not you be the villain? Do you like being the villain? Have you always had fantasies about being Bluto when Popeye never finds Spinach? Does this entertain you? Do you need to create a website, where you bed wed mothers? Is that hour (if you are lucky) of pleasure which is not supreme to the million other hours you have done this, worth crushing the spirit of some young husband, who would be a better husband has his wife not read a Harlequin Romance novel and could not measure him to Bartholomew David Anglosberg (the stud from the book). Do you even know what the word Harlequin means? With Webster, and Doubleday by my side I certainly do. Harlequins are clowns, or buffoons. Your assumption has surely made a harlequin out of you.  Another scenario: I personally find atheism to be a very inarticulate, unlearned, lazy, and egotistical way to believe. I am a Christian. If I tell you that your beliefs make you a buffoon (there is that word again), I will be strung up to the proverb's post and burned like Joan of Arc. Though, you personally as a ""non-conformist"" (also known as someone who conformed to nonconformity which basically makes you conform anyway...hmmmm), decide that any faith is a joke. You find it amusing to trample persons of faith with your uneducated and Xeroxed approved rhetoric. This time however I am a villain, because you are speaking with a unique tongue (or so society would proclaim). Unique, give me a break, most of the atheist approach is an overused series of arguments formed by people who's knowledge then, would make yours now, look as if it couldn't fill a hollow water melon seed.  Then there is abortion, cloning, gun control, death penalty, and several other life philosophies. On each side of each argument are more uneducated esteem juiced beef cakes to make the head's head explode. We call people on the opposite side of us ignorant. Yet, the very definition of ignorance is a condition of misinformation. In this case I have to ask.....How does one know which is being played. We all come to our conclusions based on the knowledge we have. Who is to say which knowledge is truth? Couldn't we all be brainwashed to some degree? If one man reads ten books nine of which are fictional, and another reads one book of nonfiction, which man is more informed? Think about that. A degree from Yale, could ultimately be a degree of dung that money has made into fertilizer. Therefore a degree from Crustation Corner High School, may be fertilizer, though people keeping stepping in it, and calling it dung.  Ultimately in everything all we really have to go on in all opinions, beliefs, and ways of life , is faith. Faith is all we have. Face it, we may all be fool of dung, our faith is what fertilizes us and makes us grow. So in this, should we not respect the faiths of others, and discuss our differences, yet tread lighter on theirs.

130039,4094511,2004-07-30,"My first blog. I am not sure exactly how to do this, so I am going to try and wing it. The Replacements sing ""Bastards of Young"" and Jack Kerouac wants me to sell my rug. Life is grand, the fool is galloping through a life, where his debts are yet repaid.  I had a conversation with a man today. We both spoke the universal language of beauty. He asked me how my love life was, and I told him of my gorgeous treasure. I asked him of his, and he told me of a gorgeous diamond. Jaded, as I usually am it was today that I understood, all me are struck by beauty. While beauty comes in many different shapes and sizes, and is truly in the eyes of the beholder...the beheld are almost gods or goddesses (depending of your preference) to our small worlds. Which leads me to another point, it's really not a small world after all. The world is only small when we make it so. When we surround ourselves with beauty, love, laughter, fresh air, and hints of God, the world is huge. The air is so abundant that we can't breathe enough. The trees are so green that they take on an unnamed color. The sky is so blue, that heaven seems to be a calm and peaceful ocean, that we all dare sail.  We are the sons of no one? Not quite, we are the sons of this world, its creator, and even its bad seed. However, we are bastards of young. Fatherless to the thought of aging. For life is indeed eternal, even to the atheist.

The latest in the series did not attract the number of people as its predecessor. Leaving the site to run on itâs own. I progressed to other things, such as a small, simplistic portfolio page and making a website for the Ise Lodge United Football Club Under 15 Girls. This was the project that I chronicled for you in this record, sadly this will be abandoned as no-one at the team is able to run the site, or provide me with any information to put on it. Now, I am bored. I have no current project. Soâ¦. After seeing the that other sites belonging to other people combine multiple aspects together in a single site, I am inspired to emulate this. And since thinking about this, I have had an idea. It will work, and Iâm going to do it.  I'm going to enjoy this.!"

148015,4194617,2004-08-16,"The Oregon Zoo, to which my lovely wife and I are members, has a couple of good things to do to beat the summer heat. One of our favs is the Polar Bear exhibit. On a hot summer day, they're likely to be swimming, and it's a hoot to watch them from underground. They are great, hairy, graceful behemoths in the water. Kids tend to crowd the windows and bang on the glass, which their idiot parents freely allow. I don't let that bad behavior to spoil my experience but as a result, I do find myself planting myself in front of windows and other views with no guilt, even though I block it for others for a brief time- it's just a self-defense thing.   The other fav of mine is the Lorikeets, whom you can feed for $1. They are colorful and noisy, and not afraid to take what they want. They'll also poop on unsuspecting bystanders so you have to watch out. People love to give small children food cups for the birds, only to watch the more timid kids wail in fear when the birds dive in for the food.   Kids are also frequently frightened by the Himalamazon thrill ride, which is kind of a movie/roller coaster combo. I like it because it is air-conditioned excitement - we went with my brother in-law yesterday and because the kid beside him cried and his seat had to be stopped, we all 3 got another free ride. Wahoo!   In the cool bat cave, the fox bats will happily dine on fruit and broccoli, as well as try to mate. I saw one male try to move in behind a female and mate with her, but she reached up between her legs and nipped his little balls and put an end to that. I had to laugh - she plainly said, ""Take that, you impudent little bugger!""  Some people say the zoo is for little kids, but my wife and I disagree. It's plainly for adults who love animals and nature and for older and braver kids."
148016,4194617,2004-08-15,"Nothin' tastes better than cold microbrew on a hot day, and that's what we got at the Bite. The wineries were also out in force doing their pretty good thing, and even Budweiser was there claiming it uses Willamette Valley hops. I stuck to my favorite Widmer all the same. We took the venerable Yellow Line down to Waterfront Park and joined the throngs for some excellent King salmon in Pinot Gris huckleberry sauce, some fondue in a tiny bread bowl (from a German restaraunt called the ""Berlin Inn"" that claims it will hosting ""Barktoberfest"" in a few weeks), some very tasty Marionberry pie and some excellent zydeco. It's all about ""Brand Oregon"" this year, and berries were represented very well. It's so good!   I swear I've never seen so many Hawaiian shirts. Don't know why other than this is an attempt to suggest it's party time. I wish summer here could last forever."
148017,4194617,2004-08-14,"Last night my sweetie got off early from work and we celebrated by going to the ""Lovely Hula Hands"" restaraunt off super trendy Mississippi Avenue. It's a remodeled house kind of not near anything, really - hard to find unless you spot its bright pink exterior as you happen to be driving by on the way to somewhere else. It was lovely food, don't know whose hula hands prepared it.  Then we drove out into the Gorge on the Old Scenic Highway, which is still scenic even at night. We stopped at a small park up a few hundred feet elevation from the Columbia River called ""Women's Forum Park"" (odd name), because it had a low-lit spot for looking at the stars. It was just 20 miles out of Portland, but what a difference it makes to be away from all that light pollution! We lay on our backs in the grass and snuggled as we watched the meteors zip by, and tried to keep over over-excited dog from barking at everyone else.   Our sweet dog is a 70-pound, gorgeous chocolate lab mix from the Multnomah County Animal Shelter. We love her dearly. Although she gets taken to Portland Parks routinely, she almost never goes out at night, and the spookiness of the dark brought out her inner watchdog. She just wouldn't settle down and shut up. After a spell of trying to amuse herself by lying on her back in imitation of us, she grew bored and kept standing over us and goofily looking down in our faces and blocking our view as we tried to look up at the stars, walking on our heads and other body parts, and tangling us up in her leash. She finished her evening banished to the back of the car.   Nonetheless, it was most romantic and a wonderful August evening."

It was hard to get any news coverage given that there were a few other fascinating things competing, like Mighty Hurricane Charley in Florida, a resigning and newly out governor in New Jersey, and the opening of the Olympic games in Athens. Oh, and that pesky situation in the middle east.   Anyway, for those of us actually paying attention, we enjoyed a very interesting juxtaposition of styles. Bush played to a small group of invitation-only small business owners in Beaverton. Kerry held a huge rally in Portland's Waterfront Park to which anyone could come. There were lots of body blows, hair pulling and illegal chair usages. Although I didn't hear much new on either side, I have to award my vote for the winner to Kerry for style - hands down!"

148020,4194617,2004-08-11,"Today is the second day of a ""severe smog alert"" here in the City of Roses. I could see it, taste it and even feel the weight of it on the drive home from Salem - a brown haze that obliterated the views of the mountains, reminded me of L.A., and caused me to want to drive like some kind of crazed fiend to get out of it and stop contributing to it. The sick thing is, our air quality is still rated ""good"". Compared to what?! I shudder to think.  Nothing sours my psyche more, because I've always felt a slightly smug little spark of joy knowing that the air quality here has always been better than most other places I've lived in my life. It is due in part to a series of 90+ degree days - another thing people don't think about when they imagine Portland. But, an arid desert we do become each summer. It is normally a coolish green city with lots of trees and fresh air and more than its fair share of misty rain.   Simultaneouly, and perhaps even more frightening, global warming is being blamed for the new dead zone that covers an alarming range of Oregon coastline. Everything in its path is killed due to oxygen depleted cold waters that creep up from the deep. It's kind of like all those deaths caused by earthquakes near ancient lakes that are filled with toxic gasses trapped near the lakebed an held in place by algea.   Yuck. I've got to find a job that allows me to walk or bike to work."
148021,4194617,2004-08-11,"When my lovely lesbian wife and I first moved to the Rose City, we lived in a trendy NE neighborhood. It was, by PDX standards, a pain in the ass. Too crowded, too noisy, piggish neighbors, and way too much traffic. Given that Bridgetown is one easy place to get around, that's saying something.  Soon, we came to our senses and moved to what is rapidly becoming another trendy neighborhood. Now we live in hot hot hot Overlook. We are rather pleased with ourselves for picking so well (although we still have some piggish neighbors).  Yes, we lucky denizens of NoPo (that's North Portland to the less hip among us) get to ride the newly opened Light Rail line, a line colored yellow for cheerfulness and optimism. The line has all sorts of cool art embedded in it, on the stations, along the sidelines, in the accompanying new businesses, and there's even poetry on the inside of the trains. It gives us something to look at while we are trying to avoid making eye contact with the crazy/drunk/hostile homeless person sitting across from us.  It is the yellow line of hope that will take me down to the Waterfront on Friday to see John Kerry stumping in Stumptown. I understand such luminaries as Jon Bon Jovie and Leonarda diCaprio (or ""de Craprio"" as someone once called him) will be joining the party. I'm happy to have them join the dogpile and all, but neither of these glam fellows exactly appeals to the prototypical Portland dweller's sense of style. We're quirky here and we like things a little dark around the edges; not too easily accessed; not too marketable by the mainstream."

This blog will chronicle my observances of life in the mildly moist city I have chosen as a current roosting spot.       There are many oddities and wonders here, starting with our peculiar habit of referring to the place as 'Portland, Ore.', rather than simply 'Portland, OR.' as our more efficient neighbor states do.

Look what this trip is doing to me, but more importantly, the ""us"". I can't recall the the last time that I hugged him or how it felt but I have a picture of him in my head that is seen clearly. I was at a stop light and he went right infront of me. I cried so hard on that trip home, It was just hitting me that I wouldn't see him for that long! I arrived home and was glad to see my mom home because I ran into her arms and received and much needed hug. I think it was the first time I hugged my mom in awhile. It just goes to show that no matter what, moms really are there for you and I appriciate that. I can't remember the first time I talked to Bill because at that time I was talking to probably nine or ten people that I kinda liked at that time. I can however remember the first time I saw him in person, there he was sitting so patiently for me. I love that kid and...

148314,3820228,2004-07-03,"Today was such an awesome day! Much Better than I thought it was going to be! I went to ""Blues Fest 04"" that was taking place in Portland today and just being around good and fun people was enough. It was was my first time that I was flirted with (by a guy;) His smile was the cutest feature. Then, soon after that, I was walking the other way now and I caught this shirt-less, muscle man wearing a cowboy hat and an hot tan! Ugh, I love being in a big city!! Ya don't get this in Bay City! People that are gay in Michigan are either flamers or just plain ugly (well, the ones in my city). I gotta hand it to Michigan though, there are some hot mo-fo-ers here (Like my guy:) ...OH, and I was standing in the crowds minding my own buisness and all the sudden I get beer spilt on my leg! I look down and all I see is this older dude lying on the ground. Then I look back and notice that the older dude fell because these two chicks tripped and fell over the damn guy! I look down at the girls to make sure they're all right and they were laughing then turned and started macking right there!! It's just that it was done so... randomly! I couldn't belive this all happened in like seconds! sheesh! It was fun, then I actually had a cute guy walk up to me and started talking to me but my dad was right there! The one time that he is (ofcourse) Ugh! Anyways, I'm out! Later Bro!... and you too."
148315,3820228,2004-07-02,"Where did everyone go? The cell that I use to call my ppl back in Bay City has free weekend minutes. So I call them.. well, at least try to anyways! No one was home except for 2 people (Jewlzs and Jena)... I tried calling other peeps buuut they weren't home so, what can ya do? I dunno... I'm gonna go get ready for a concert now though. K? K!"
148316,3820228,2004-07-02,"Today was more eventful that normal. My grand-rents actually wanted to do something rather than sit around my dad's place all day! First, we went to Fred Meyer and I tried on these really slick pair of skateboard shoes by ""NSS Preformance"". I don't know how to skateboard but these were tight! They looked hella-good on me too! :) Mmm, what else? Ooo, there was Starbucks! the last Starbucks I was in, was in New York City back in April. Yuuup! Got the ""Strawberry&Creme"" Frap(Veinti size) w/whipped creme atop! Mmm, OH and there are some hot sales happening at Old Navy and Gap! I just got a HOT pair of boxers from the Gap though (arn't ya proud of me?!) Yeah, then I am going to a ""Blue, Brews and Barbques"" festival on the Willamette river in Portland. It should be a good time. Next Sunday, I'm going back heading back home (2 weeks earier than expected) but I'm not gonna tell anyone this news so I can suprise them. It will be six weeks that I was gone rather than eight weeks. Ehh, I miss some people there. This is a good chance to come back an improved person! I think I'll do that. Not judging everyone even if they'll find out or not and such... Yeah, that's the plan. (Not to mention, coming back a tanner man!)"
148317,3820228,2004-07-01,"I dunno, I just seem to have this problem with being in a rather large city and not being out with freinds. I'm from Michigan, visting my father here in Portland and I bet there are some good hang-out spots here! I wanna just take my grandpa's keys there on the table and be off for the night!... My dad is too much of a light sleeper. He'll find me gone and you'll find me dead! Heh heh, that was funny! :) Oh, if ya wanna see some pics of me click  urlLink here ! Ugh, I'm feeling different emotions right now. I know that I want to get back to Michigan and see Bill but everyone else except for a few selected, I don't care about. Above all though, If Bill wasn't there, I would finish me two remaining years here without a doubt!"
148318,3820228,2004-07-01,"I was down at the pool just as the sun was going down today and I went into the hot tub. There he was, the guy that was always giving me this look that said ""Hey, your pretty cute"". Well, I'm not sure if I know how to give that one but I was wondering if I did when he followed me into the hot tub. Then I got to thinking how BAD that would be if my dad walked over to check up on me if I started doing any kind of flirting. Ugh, not only that but I have a boyfrind back in michigan who loves me! I don't know what to do with these young hormones of mine sometimes. I love Bill too though and I wouldn't do anything anyways. But, sure enough, my dad came stollin' in! Ehh, it's alright!"
150796,4235817,2004-08-16,"Man today is teh boring....The only thing I have done that is the remotest thing to anything fun is download some music and some Invader Zim  episodes...I might go to my Aunt's house to spendthe night, which is always fun. Im probally not going to sleep tonight and get drunk off my ass... Ttyl"
150797,4235817,2004-08-14,"Today was was teh fun... We (As in Alfred, Jeff, and I) went to Munjal's house for a few mintues after Jeff was being a fscking dick and not giving the proper diredctions and making my Grandma CraZy... We stayed there for like five mintues then we all piled into Munjal's Mom's minivan. Alfred and I were talking in teh back and Jeff kept tell us to shut up... but i didn't see teh reason:). We arrived at our destination (which was teh Computer Fair)  at about 11:30. There was a Cheerleading Compitition going on or something because there was ALOT of Cheerleaders(about 500-600). Munjal and Jeff got lucky and didn't have to pay the $8 entrance fee but me and Alfred weren't so lucky. Once we got in the fair we walked around the booths and noticed there was a Adult Section, we were tempted to go in (no one was looks and i think no one cared either... What a country!!!) We walked around somemore.About 12:00 i made my first purchase, which was a 450 watt power supply(Which is a vast improvment over my old 300 watt power supply). After about 15mintues of more walking and mulling around we went to the other building (hehehe). I kept telling Alfred not to mess with the Asains because you never know if they know Karate or some other Marital Arts to kick your ass with. Then Alfred thought of asking all the salepeople if all the prices were in American Currency, it was funny for a while then it got kinda old (but funny nonetheless). I found a table where they were selling Tri-flame lighters, I was pondering whether or not just to take it and walk away but i deicided to be a good kid and pay for it (besides it was cheap any ways,$3!!!!). So me and Alfred walked outside because Munjal and Jeff went to find a Dual-layer DVD burner. Then me and Alfred went to the table were the lighters were and bought Alfred one. On the way back from that raunting trip i found a wire-less keyboard and mouse for $30 but i only had $22, so Alfred was a good friend and spotted me $8 :). After the Computer Fair we came to my house. my Grandma ordered pizza and then we had the bright idea to go to Seven-Eleven which is about 1/4 mile away from my house up a very very slight incline over a stretch of road about 1000 feet it might be yards i don't know...When we came back i took  a picture for his fake Canadian school ID. Then jeff called his Parental Units and had to go home,Alfred went with him:(.....Now im alone talking to you gay peoples... Im outta here, Later......"

158485,4121937,2004-08-04,"In Johannesburg electric fencing seems to be the norm, and I always believed that is was not necessary down here in Cape Town. We don't live in an upmarket suburb, but close to town and houses here are not cheap, but then they aren't cheap anywhere in Cape Town anymore.    We have quite a few families living in our road, with lots of little kids, and the domestics all know each other, go to the park or the local cafe together, and walk to the station after work. So it's not like it's a deserted road during the day which would kind of be more enticing for burglars.    It all started a few weeks ago, the first incident was that our domestic worker was in the house when somebody was trying to kick down our back door. We have great alarming and panic buttons all over, so she reacted fast and the guy ran off.    Two weeks later, same kind of scenario, but she now saw the guy, a person wearing a balaclava and carrying a panga knife. Again she reacted and the police arrived quickly as did the armed response. No sign of the guy though.    Last week it got considerably worse. Our nanny was putting our smallest child down for a nap, walked back to the kitchen to see a man in the house. She screamed, he turned around saw her, started cursing her, grabbed a knife out of his socks or shoes and walked toward her. She ran, screaming, opened the front door, activated the panics, - all the neighbours came out, and actually saw the guy face to face as he ran off down the road. He of course wasn't caught, but I don't even care about that. Our little one woke up in midst of all the screaming and he is still not well, he keeps talking about it and waking up at night. I just get really mad, the bastards, coming into the house like that.    However, we were all truly shaken and made some frantic phonecalls to a whole lot of customers and withing 24 hours we had the whole bloody place surrounded by electric fencing. All modern, connected to alarms, panics, sirens, armed response etc. Doesn't look as bad as I feared, and worth the peace of course.   Haven't bothered putting up warning signs yet, and am secretly hoping someone will come and try climb over the walls again. And it will take me a while to call an ambulance..."
158486,4121937,2004-08-03,"Having grown up in Germany, a country that prides itself on efficiency and cleanliness, living in South Africa, with all kind of bugs being part of life, can sometimes be a bit taxing. Well so I thought, I never realized how bad it can get.   Until   Saturday morning.    We live in Cape Town, and it is winter here, and very cold and rainy. So this very vibey, trendy restaurant in town, decided to hold a Christmas in July charity ball. Beautifully organised, the whole place set out in glittering, shiny Christmas decorations, a marquee in front of it, with a stage and dance floor. Lots of entertainment, magicians that come to the table, body painted ""artists"" twisting and doing yoga kind of movements for you. Music, food stations, everything. Came at a fee, but the proceeds go to a charity for Aids orphans, so every penny was worth spent.    As I'm not very good at doing my own hair I booked an appointment in a salon for a wash and blow dry. Normal thing. I had been a few days before. When I arrived, I saw the stylist look up from her magazine with a more than usual ""I've been waiting for you"" look. Just something in her eyes made me think: what's that about, I'm not late..   Instead of sending me straight to the basin for the wash thing, she said, ""have a seat.""    ""I noticed you have a very dry scalp."" She continued. Then she started examining my hair, putting clips in it, moving strands of hair around and then turning to her collegue, calling her over. The funky purple haired collegue came over, took a look, nodded - and left. Just like that.    I felt my heart beat go up, we do live in Africa and I have 3 children, two of which are at school. And when people start investigating your hair like that, you kind of have an inkling of what the hell is going on.    ""I'm awfully sorry, but you have nits in your hair"" -    Yes,you heard right, nits as in lice! OHHH my God. It all came to me in an instant. There had been an outbreak of lice at one of my kids schools, and we had struggled to get rid of it, I won't bore you with the details. Of course, I never, ever ,thought that I could catch it, and I wasn't sure who to kill first, or if I should just drop dead myself, right there.    ""You are kidding? Nits? That can't be! Are you sure? "" I asked. The stylist continued to tell me that,apparently they had had a problem at the salon, that there had been some kind of lice epidemic, and that a few of their ""ladies"" had been affected. - Didn't believe a word. She just said that to make me feel better, or to try and pretend that this was no big deal. But she didn't fool me. Sweet as she was. She kind of apologized that she was not able to touch my hair and could I please go home and sort it out. I kind of pretended I didn't know what to do, and she filled me in that the pharmacists have special shampoos etc.    I then asked her how on earth I can get up and leave without dying of embarrassment, and she assured me that no-one knew and I could just go. LOL. Another lie. ALL the stylists knew,I'm sure.    Well, I just got up with my messy, nit infested hair and walked out.    Outside I immediately grabbed my mobile phone and called my husband who was at a play center for little kids called Dingy Dungles in our family, better known as Jimmy Jungles in the adult world.    He answered and asked me how things were. I gave him hell, telling him that I was not good at all, that we can cancel the bloody ball, and that I was going to kill each of the three kids, and that it was his fault for having so many kids and that he chose a bad school which was lice infested.    He knows me well, and loves me, he started laughing, and said buy the lice stuff and I'll meet you at home and I will help you get the nits out.    So I bought some lice killing new age plus lice spray, a nailpolish which was on sale, a conditioner, a bubble bath at the pharmacy. On my way to the parking lot I bought a pair of black and silver highheels ( also on sale).    At home, my husband swore I had nothing of the sorts in my hair, while pulling little bits of ""dry scalp"" out..    I landed up putting rollers in my hair and wasn't to unhappy with my appearence in the end, considering the circumstances.    So we went to the ball and it was great, although it was also not what it was supposed to be, but that's a story for another day....   Oh, I won't even bother mentioning what I discovered when I checked the two older kids hair... Fact is, the pharmacy scored when my husband hotfooted it there to do another purchase. :)   I don't know if I will ever go back to that hairdresser though, I'm still trying to figure out a story I can tell them when I go back. Any ideas?"

167922,878542,2004-07-13,"Wearable computers are an interest of mine. I think it's the obvious next step, and I'm just waiting for always-on mobile internet connections before trying to make the switch myself.   Wearables aren't mainstream yet, but a certain kind of mobile computing is, cellphones. Cellphones are general computers and getting more and more powerful every day. Some people think that they are leading the way towards localization of computer and internet access. I must admit, the more powerful smartphones look a great deal like general personal computers. I could use a Treo 610 for.. almost everything except development for my job.   We'll see.   Here is a captured message from a mailing list. Thanks to Eugen Leitl for forwarding it.  ============================================================== From: ""Thad E. Starner""   Date: Tue, 13 Jul 2004 22:40:59 -0400 (EDT) To: wearables@cc.gatech.edu Subject: [wearables] On-body computing outsells desktops + laptops 3:1 (sales stats)  Folks-         Popular Science magazine asked me to write a ""future headline"" blurb for them.  What we gave them was  2015 Intel Abandons Desktop Market (Thad Starner and James Fusia III)  In a surprise move today, Intel announced it will no longer support its processors for the legacy desktop market. Simultaneously, the chip giant announced five new low power processor lines for the wearable and embedded markets.  Since 2003, processors for on-body computers have outsold desktop and laptop processors combined.   Intel was best known during that period for its relatively power hungry x86 desktop processors.  This 3:1 figure for 2003 has become part of my regular talks now.  Popular Science didn't believe the stats, so I had to point to some standard industry sources to back it up.  I thought y'all might find these stats and pointers useful.  Summary: 164M total PCs sold in 2003 (Gartner) 128M desktops+servers sold in 2003 (IDC + Gartner) 36M laptops (IDC) ------- 510M-533M mobile phone handsets (Gartner Dataquest) 24M portable compressed (i.e. computerized) music players (InStat) ------ 10.4M PDA sales (IDC) -------- 600k Tablet PC sales (IDC estimate mid-2003) [DETAILS and URLs BELOW]  Tablet PCs are not doing very well (no surprise, given that the same idea did not do well in the early 1990s).  More interesting to me, however, is that PDA sales are declining from 12.6M in 2002 to 10.4M in 2003!!  Basically, as Brad Rhodes predicted, the road to wearables seems to be through the mobile phone.  Even more interesting, by my calculations, Nokia is now the #1 consumer computer manufacturer in the world (55M handsets vs 28M desktop+laptop computers by HP-17% of the market).  Before y'all get on my case about that one, remember that most of Nokia's phones are more powerful than the highest end desktop in 1990!  Here is an interesting question: How many handsets run the Symbian OS? Or, for shock value, when will Symbian overtake Microsoft Windows as the dominant OS platform on the planet given current growth rates?  No wonder Microsoft is fighting so hard to get into the phone market! Not only is it the only way to continue its growth, but it may be the only way for it to survive as we know it! (Shhh, don't tell them - do you really want to rely on Windows for your phone calls?  Think about it.)  My prediction?:  We will see the phone take over more and more of the usual PC tasks until the PC becomes as irrelevant to the dominant computing culture as the minicomputer or mainframe.                                                 Thad =========================================  Details:  According to IDC desktop+notebook+ultra portable + x86 servers = 38.373M third quarter 2003 (no handhelds).  http://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=pr2003_10_14_151735  Elsewhere, Information Week claims the PC market is expect to improve 13.6% in 2004 to 186.4M units sold using data by Gartner.  http://www.informationweek.desktoppipeline.com/showArticle.jhtml?articleId=22101539  Simple algebra implies that there were actualy 164M PCs sold in 2003.

It was interesting to watch the audience, largely hard-core democrats from the LA area, hoot and clap and root for their boy.   It was shameless propaganda, which I think most people got. But some haven't, and are laboring under the assumption that either the democrats or republicans are actually reporting anything like facts.   Here is a forum discussion started out with a liberal journalist collecting all the deceit in the film. It's actually surprisingly, more than I caught, which bodes badly for more credulous viewers.

167927,878542,2004-07-06,"urlLink Adaptive Artificial Intelligence Inc. - Home   I just uploaded the latest and greatest news post on our company website, and upgraded our opportunities page. We're looking for brilliant minds, know anyone?   My time here has been very happy, and quite productive. In analysis, while my activity in most other areas is severely depressed by my isolation and focus, I am getting more concrete things accomplished than by working on my own. With a the serious plus that I'm contributing to a still greater pool of collective accomplishment, of course.   Also pluses that I know do interesting work full time. Which is actually more stressful than I would have thought. While I found part time work in unrelated fields stressful, I think I may have used it as a way to rest the less developed parts of my brain. Working here has re-introduced me to the pain of inadequate mental performance, having to self-limit work for quality, and etc. It's a good thing, though. I think my performance will ultimately rise permanently as a result of some of the mistakes I've made and learned from here.   The longer I work here, the more I think that A2I2 is really in front of anyone else in this game, and I'm glad I'm here.  I do worry, occasionally, that I'm working the best I can, and being the most productive in the right places. It's not clear exactly what challenges and problems lie ahead, and I occasionally fear that I'll top out, and be unable to contribute usefully past a certain point. What would I do then? I've become very accustomed to following the edge of development, even if I lag behind in the implementation or details, in most everything I research. If I ever found anything to be honestly beyond me.. I can't really say what I would do.   And then the question would arise, what precisely can I do, in order to continue contributing towards my goals, which are currently predicated on the assumption that nothing in my path is beyond me personally. I can't very well expect others to carry me to my own goals. As much as I respect and like Peter, I can't measure by his capability and understanding, it's not mine.   Sometimes it seems like my future shrinks with each year. I can't say that I really even look much past a year from now anymore. When I was 18 I had my whole life planned out. It seems like that was a long long time ago."

174401,3839660,2004-07-15,"Modern society operates under many falsehoods - and one of the larger ones that has an extraordinary effectiveness at keeping Christians quiet is the ""H"" word...Hypocrite.  Here's how it goes:      Those who speak about Christ and their faith in the public arena (that is, anywhere outside of the home or church) are hypocrites unless they, themselves, are perfect in their own lives.       Got that?  In fact, sometimes a person doesn't even need to speak publicly about his or her faith.  Many times one can merely be a committed, practicing Christian and yet be labeled a hypocrite....Why you ask?  Well, many believe that the simple act of attending mass regularly - of calling oneself a Christian - is a pious statement of moral superiority over others who do not attend.  And if a Christian has the gall to bring his or her faith into a public forum - to talk about Christ or his teachings - that individual risks a severe backlash...criticism that they are attempting to force their values on other people, and scorn if they fall short of those values in any public way.  They risk the dreaded label of ""hypocrite.""      We don't like hypocrites in our society - one of the rare Christian values that has taken root in secular society.  It connotes tremendous phoniness and lack of authenticity - something Christ attributed to the biblical Pharisees who preached the letter of the law while violating the heart of the word.  In today's age, ""hypocrisy"" has become one of the more damning charges a person can hurl at another.  So it stands to reason that most of us try to avoid the label, keeping quiet about our faith and Christ's teachings.  We leave the preaching to the perfect people - that is, the real hypocrites.  The rest of us employ kind of a ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy in our lives so as not to place ourselves on any kind of moral pedestal.  We tell ourselves that we'll wait to spread the word about Christ when we're better behaved - when we come closer to being the perfect Christian.  Only then will we share our religious faith with others.  Of course, that day will never come because sharing the word of God is part of BEING a perfect Christian.  If we shut others out of our faith and religious experiences, we will never BECOME more perfect.       Today, the ""hypocrite"" label is a trap that acts to keep Christians in the closet.  Yet the bible never tells us that we need to be perfect to share the work Christ is performing in our lives.  It doesn't say that we have to be biblical scholars to share one of Christ's teachings.  Consider the model of  Alcoholics Anonymous .  The whole premise of AA is one alcoholic helping another.  For those of you who don't know how AA operates, when a newbie attends a meeting for the first time, one of the first things that happens is the newbie gets paired up with a Sponsor.  The Sponsor is, basically, a more seasoned recovering alcoholic who supports and guides the newbie through the ten step recovery process.  Although the Sponsor has been dry for a period of time, he or she is STILL very much an alcoholic - still tempted by regular urges to have a drink.  Yet the Sponsor is placed in the role of mentor and teacher to the newbie - one alcoholic teaching another alcoholic how to be sober, passing along moral guidance (and, in some cases, moral judgement) on the newbie's behavior.  The philosophy, of course, is that the act of teaching and sharing IS a learning process in and of itself - it helps to reinforce the Sponsor's own commitment to sobriety, as much as it helps the newbie stay sober.     The greater parallel to life is obvious.  We are all sinners.  Should this be an obstacle to sharing Christ's work in our lives?  Take me for instance...Let's say on the way home from work I flip off another driver off who is blocking my way on the freeway - then, a little later, I catch myself fantasizing about a female colleague at the office.  I then get home from work and take a phone call from a friend who asks me how I've been doing.  I think to myself how much I want to work up the courage to share the great work Christ has been performing in my life.  I want to tell him how fulfilling church has become to me lately.  I want to share all of this with my buddy, yet I know I just committed road rage on the way home while mentally defiling a female colleague who isn't my wife.  So the moral dilemma is...Should I keep my faith to myself for fear of becoming a hypocrite?  Or should I share my good news?  How would Jesus advise me?      Well, I think the answer is obvious - Jesus would want me to share the good news.  I serve the Lord much better by sharing his good work, so that my friend might find his own way to Christ's mercy - an in addition, so that my own faith and journey to becoming a more perfect Christian is strengthened.  Of course, I am not off the hook for my behavior earlier in the day - not at all.  Additionally, if I were to have told my friend how perfectly I'd been behaving since growing closer to the Lord...well then the ""hypocrite"" label would surely apply to me.  But the simple act of sharing Christ's good news with my friend, one sinner to another, was the best thing I could have done that day - especially given my poor behavior on the way home from work.     There are many in society who believe in moral relativism.  They believe values are conditional for each individual and culture.  They don't believe in truths, and they don't believe in a God that would speak in truths and absolutes.  In fact, they believe religious people - those that follow a biblical-based denomination (as opposed to a new-age offshoot) - are backwards, weakminded, and old fashioned.  Why?...Well, I will explore this topic in another post, but for now just take my word for it.     Don't listen to these knuckleheads.  We do not have to be perfect to talk about Jesus.  In fact, Christ asks us to tell others about him - he doesn't want bystanders, he wants participatory Christians.  He wants us talking and communicating with one another about his church.  He wants us to have a sense of urgency about how much time we have on this earth to straighten out our lives.  He doesn't want you sitting on the sidelines waiting for the magical day you suddenly become perfect enough to talk about him.  After all,  he came here for the imperfect people.   His disciples were imperfect people.  King David, one of the most celebrated figures in the bible, committed several notorious sins.       Once I was in confession telling a priest how I felt unworthy to participate in the service because of how poorly I had been leading my life.  The priest looked me dead in the eye and told me that I'm a tough case, and that Jesus likes the tough cases - the hard ones.  I have to tell you that hearing him say that made me feel so good.  It gave me hope.  Jesus told us that the heart of the law is mercy.  He came here to change the hearts of the people that keep messing up - the cheats, the adulters, the liars, the assholes, etc., so if that's you - if you're a ""hard case"" - then you're exactly who Christ wants in his church.  He probably figures if he can win you over then you're likely to bring in more just like you, and his church will grow.        Don't worry about what modern society deems appropriate.  Many (perhaps, most) of Jesus' teachings run counter to the values of modern society anyway.  In these instances, they would have you be quiet so as not to pass moral judgment over others.  But that's not want Jesus wants.  He wants us to stand up for the truth - not to condemn others, but to spread his word no matter who it offends.  He wants us to come to church regardless of how perfect we've behaved the week prior.  He wants us to share our religious feelings with others even if we don't have it all worked out ourself.  I am, myself, a chronic sinner.  This blog is my way of connecting with my faith and understanding my own belief system in spite of my chronic sinning.  I ask that God give me the strength to resist modern society's attempt to shove me into the closet.  I know that the only way I can become a better Christian is to talk about my faith, damn modern society's labels."
174402,3839660,2004-07-04,"Welcome to my blog.  Jesus once said to his disciples  ""be perfect, like your father in heaven is perfect.""   Yet they weren't living in 21st century society, a system that by any standard undermines faith values much more than it supports them.  Religious principles are simply not discussed in most social settings.  They are almost anathema in professional environments.  In fact, the very act of religious conversation makes many (if not most) uncomfortable - myself included.  It seems too personal or serious during most occasions - an intrusion into our private self.  Jesus keeps getting shoved deeper and deeper into the closet.  We let him out when socially acceptable...such as at mass, or alone in our thoughts - what amounts to a few hours (maybe) during one's week.     Yet, most of us allow SOCIETY'S values to dominate our conversation and thinking throughout the week: sex, money, success, power.  We freely talk about them  everywhere  and at  anytime .  Society's values rarely make us feel uncomfortable.  They pervade our homes, our workplaces, our schools, and most of our social occasions.  They are reinforced on television, radio and on the internet.  They make Christianity seem so far out of modern context that it feels natural to sweep the cross under the rug for all but a few hours of the week.  Once more, certain societal opinion-makers actually go so far as to ridicule or put down faith values AND those who espouse them, calling them narrow-minded, or simplistic, or unsophisticated, or at times even bigoted or hypocritical.  The very act of standing up for Christ is, in their view, wrong and harmful.  Is it any wonder why the world seems so twisted and confusing at times?  Intolerance of Christ's teachings has cast a shadow over us all, and the downward spiral of indignity and inhumanity in today's society reflects this.  It's time for us all to collectively step back from the brink and assume some spiritual leadership over our lives, our families, our communities and our church.  I am 33 years old and I've let society drive a wedge between myself and Christ.  I'll get into the reasons in further posts, but the fact remains that I have been spiritually bankrupt most of my adult life.  I have not been able to get any sustained, spiritual traction.  I don't blame it all on society, but society sure made it easier to hide Jesus in the closet.  This blog is intended to be a tool for me to bring Jesus back out and into my public life.  Jesus told us that those who are embarrassed of him in this life will share the reverse fate in the afterlife.  How could I let 33 years go by embarrassed of Christ?  This blog will hopefully be the start of the coming-out party.  Along the way I will share with you my thoughts on the lessons I have learned on the road to being a true Christian in the modern era.  I am hoping this will be both therapeutic, educational and spiritually uplifting for me - perhaps it will also be helpful for others to witness.  And as I share my thoughts about Christ in the virtual world, may Jesus give me the courage to let him out of the closet in the real world.  On another note, I am going to talk candidly in my blog.  In many ways, modern society is an enemy to the practicing Christian - and when battling any enemy, a key rule of thumb is to know how the adversary thinks and behaves.  In other words, I have to get real.  I can't discuss the pitfalls of 21st century societal values without, at times, getting very graphic and specific about all of its tests.  I think a weakness of many of today's preachers is their inability, or unwillingness, to get down into the trenches of modern sin and temptation by talking its language.  But this is where the battle is being waged for the hearts and souls of the 21st century Christian.  So that is where I will go, regardless of the topic.  Please know this about my blog.  Lastly, I dedicate this blog to the Lord Jesus Christ, my personal savior.  It is open to all who know and love Christ, regardless of denomination, and especially regardless of how imperfect you are as a Christian.  God sent his only son to heal the morally sick, not the morally perfect.  If you fall well short of Christ's standards on a daily basis, you will be in good company here.  My goal is that the Holy Spirit will work through me on this site.  My blog, as is my life, will be in his steady hands.  God Bless."
174403,3839660,2004-08-10,"As I have mentioned previously, I have had a long-standing struggle coming to terms with my own faith. At various interludes in my life I have ""dabbled"" in Christianity. I surely have never been closer to Christ than I was as a child, when I read the bible and prayed nightly. At the time I could not appreciate the innocence of my relationship. As a 33 year old I still crave the purity and simplicity of that connection I had with Jesus. I prayed to him like he was my father, best friend, and creator all rolled into one being. I felt his spiritual presence in a manner that still alludes me to this day.  That all ended when I reached 15 or 16 years old when I began putting Christ on the backburner. Part of my motivation for this boiled down to a desire to be cool and increase my social acceptance. To this end I viewed my close, personal relationship with Christ as baggage - literally, I felt it was holding me back. Additionally, this was the age were I began connecting with my inner desire to conquest the female gender romantically and sexually. It began to override my Christian sensibilities as I thought about sex and girls nearly around the clock. I couldn't envision these feelings coexisting with my close relationship with Jesus. Nearly overnight he began losing relevance in my life.  From age 15/16, through high school graduation and into college, I barely paid lip service to Christ. Even as an adult I was preoccupied with the goals of being cool and ""hooking up"" with women. Jesus was completely on the backburner at this juncture. I attended church ever so often - typically on religious holidays with my parents. I led a sinful and gluttonous lifestyle that drove a wedge between myself and my faith - a barrier of my own making. I rationalized this barrier by declaring myself unfit for Christ... that I was unworthy of a relationship with him. I believed that my very presence in his church was hypocritical and insulting, given my past behavior and unwillingness to immediately repent and change my ways. I substituted a relationship with Jesus with guilt over my lapsed faith, yet all along I believed that he would be there for me when I was ready. I knew it was wrong to feel this way - that there were no guarantees that I would be around long enough on this earth to engage Christ on my own timetable. Yet I did it anyway.  After college I attempted a reconciliation with Jesus, which lasted about 4-6 months, after which I proceeded to return to my previous behavior (with a vengeance I might add). It wasn't until about 26/27 when I began backing off from my wilder ways, seeking a more adult pattern of behavior for myself that included a search for a more serious female companion. In addition, this was the age where I began searching for the religious path that I had abandoned so many years before, attempting to pick up the pieces of my faith. I found out that it wasn't that easy.  Old habits are hard to break. I had not gone to church on Sundays since leaving home for college at 18. I had conditioned myself to thinking of God only when I was troubled. I had conditioned myself into taking my very soul for granted, gambling that I would still be around years later to repair the damage. I had poor moral hygiene - I was used to doing as I pleased. I had also lost any shred of the spiritual intimacy I had once felt with Christ. Like all relationships, they grow stronger with the investment of time and effort, and grow weaker with neglect. I woke up at age 27 with the inability to put one foot in front of the other from a religious standpoint. I didn't even know where to begin, and I continued to let bouts with temptation and sin estrange me from Jesus. I stumbled and bumbled my way into my 30's.  After 15 years of weakness, indifference and stupidity, I am putting back the pieces. Along the way I have uncovered some truths about this process. For starters, I've learned that sin and temptation are prisons of our own creation. Jesus rightfully condemns behavior detrimental to the soul, including sexual dalliances. But part of the reason Jesus hates sin so much is because it drives a wedge between human beings and his mercy - often by our own choosing. Like a fool, I conned MYSELF (no doubt, with the help of the devil himself) into believing that I should stay away from Christ until which time I was more worthy of his grace. I was literally in a prison of my own creation, allowing sin to stand like jail bars in the way of my reaching the one thing that could help set me free - a relationship with Jesus.  I finally asked a priest about my theory of ""unworthiness"" within the state of sin. He stated that although Jesus hated the sin, he would NEVER want it to prevent me from coming to him.  He told me there was healing power to be accessed at church - as a Catholic, he specifically cited the sacrament of communion as a channel that Jesus could use to reach me. He also reminded me of something I knew as a child - that the heart of the law of God is mercy. Jesus came here to earth not to condemn but to save. He dined with tax collectors and prostitutes. I was right in one aspect - that Jesus would be here waiting for me because he has loved me since before I was ever conceived. Guilt is not a sufficient replacement for a relationship with Jesus. Guilt will not get you into heaven. Jesus wanted me in church in spite of my sinful ways so he could reach me in a manner of his choosing. Yet I felt I knew better. I stayed away and waited until my late 20s, wasting a portion of my life.  Today, I am a committed husband, and a struggling, yet determined, Christian. I will never let sin stand in the way of being in God's presence again. Yet I still deal with temptation... sexually and otherwise. I believe that this is one of the challenges Jesus has given me. He knows how I think and he knows what motivates me. I believe he expects me to exert my willpower and resist it. At the same time he is calling me to worship him, to help grow the family of believers, and to administer to those less fortunate. Along the path he will give me the tools that I need to fight my temptations and improve as a person. There is nothing for me to be embarrassed about and certainly nothing that ought to keep me away from his mercy. Temptations and sin are a part of everyone's life. We are obligated to carry them like a cross and move forward on the path."
177876,3636290,2004-06-22,"Date 5/16/04  MORNING TO 12 NOON H woke up @ 8AM and quietly turned on the TV.  He was in a good mood. We visited the Animal Shelter  (url: http://www.nashelter.org) H indicated that he would like to volunteer. He was eager to help out, and even picked up a mop and helped mop the floor!  After that we walked one of the dogs, Danny. The visit was cut short because the Animal Control Officer had to go out on a call, but we agreed to go back in 2 weeks and visit/volunteer again.  AFTERNOON 12 NOON TO 5:00 PM We walked at a local nature trail/fish hatchery.  H was upset because we forgot the bug spray, but walked the nature trail anyway.  H was very worried about Jack getting âloaded with ticksâ, but I told him Jack gets special meds to stop ticks from getting on him. (url: http://www.fws.gov/r5cneafp/nattleboro.htm)  After our walk it rained so the rest of the afternoon was spent watching movies.  He was unhappy to learn the parental controls on the TV block pg13 movies, he spent some time trying (unsuccessfully) to figure out how unlock the code. I told him PG13 movies have to be evaluated individually for content. He argued that he was old enough to watch PG13 movies; I reiterated 11 is not old enough for a movie rated for a 13 year old without supervision.   EVENING 5:00 PM TO 11:00 PM While packing to leave H jumped up on the top bunk and broke one of the slats on the bed.  He prefers to sleep on the top bunk and argued when told heâd have to use the bottom bunk until we get the top bunk fixed.  He insisted that he canât sleep on the bottom bunk, and how horrible it is.  He refused to accept that he should not sleep on the bunk with a broken slat.   Next weekend we will work on ways to fix the bed, and reasons why it isnât appropriate to jump on the bed (i.e. safety, appropriate behavior, respect for property)   Summary:  H has a very positive attitude, and is always eager to help.  He can be stubborn at times, but usually listens to reasonable explanations.  He participates in all planned activities, and enjoys making future plans.   He is asking to spend more time here, and has asked about coming over on Friday nights, and spending more time on school holidays."

He loved the museum, and was happy to hear that we would go there for a longer visit soon.  AFTERNOON 12 NOON TO 5:00 PM We spent most of the day at the house, watching movies, and cooking out.  At one point He said he was âbored out of his mindâ because we were watching a movie, Brother Bear, he had already seen.  However, I had asked him before putting the movie in if he had seen it and Iâm sure he said he had not.  Iâm still scratching my head over that one!  J  Iâve noticed HE has a heightened fear of all bugs with a specific fear of ticks.  Even with repeated doses of Cutter bug repellant he continued to swat & scratched at his legs and insisting I check his scalp for ticks.  In the house he got down on his hands and knees and looked under the baseboard heaters and was upset that he found some dead bugs under there.    EVENING 5:00 PM TO 11:00 PM After dinner, we took a long walk with Jack (the dog), along the way we met up with several people also walking their dogs.  HE was outwardly very social, but also made some negative comments about others his own age.  At one point, while walking thru a local cemetery, 3 children were walking a dog and playing around the gravestones.  HE mentioned that he thought the girl was âchoking her dogâ because the dog was pulling on the lead. I explained to him that it was the dog that was pulling the girl, not the girl choking the dog.  He also mentioned that the kids shouldnât be playing on the gravestones, which I had to agree with!"

The morningâs activities included a visit to Petsmart to see the cats in the catroom.  Henry enjoyed seeing all the dogs and cats there.  We also visited my sonâs home, where Henry met my Son, his wife and daughter.  The visit went very well, and we invited them all over for a cookout.   After arriving back home we walked with the dog to the library.  Henry got his own Library card and he is very happy about that.  He even chose a book to take home with him for the week.  NOTE: As we walked to the library he tried repeatedly to get me to let him use a path through nearby trees to âsee what was there.â  I suspected there was a reason he wanted to go down this path, and later found out that he believes that the path leads to the backyard of his former pre-adoptive family.

177885,3636290,2004-07-11,hello!  I finally got here to comment on this blog - you're doing a great job zulu - hang in there!!  I want to read a bit more and possibly chat with you before I write anything else - but I'll put your link on my blog too.
186508,4032401,2004-07-30,"Well I headlined at Rooster T Feathers Comedy Club in Sunnyvale, CA.  For those who don't know about Rooster's, it's a very nice club in Silicon Valley that caters to the Silicon Valley type, ie white and Indian.  This is perhaps one of the hardest clubs I've ever performed at.  For some reason, I do decent to well there, however, I don't KILL.  I hate not being able to KILL at a place.  And I can't figure the audience out.  They will laugh at stupid stuff and other comedians who are ok, but when I go up there they act like I'm going to rob them.  I don't want to call the audience stupid, but they should know that I would only rob them in the parking lot, not in the actual club where I'm trying to get work at.   I hate not being able to figure an audience out.  Usually you can feel them out and know if they want clean, dirty, political, sexual, racial, etc type of humor.  Well I decided that since it was a white audience to try and be clean with as little sexual humor and cussing as possible.  Other comedians before me did well and were alot more dirty than I was.  So I'm on stage and my first bit, which is one of my very best bits because it always does well, it's like one of my aces in my deck of cards, well it doesn't do very well.  I tend to tell stories that unfold and have punchlines throughout.  This place decides to wait till the very last punchline before deciding whether they will laugh or stare at you and make you feel like kicking them.  This is hard when you do long bits, because you rely on the laughter to build up to the end and keep momentum going.  Silence is not a very good confidence booster on stage.  Luckily, I get them going pretty well with my college material, weight bits, and disney and internet gangs.  The racial jokes for the most part do well, except for when I do a bit referring to white people being more likely to have incest, which I totally understand.  I do it more for my benefit then theirs.   What sucks the most is that I don't think the owner of the club stayed for any if not the first few minutes of my set.  I did this set in order for her to see me perform live and decide whether to book me or not.  If she only saw my bomb the first joke, then I'm done there.  I didn't see her after my set so I went home with my tail inbetween my legs (I have a really long butt).  I figure if she emails me and wants to book me then cool, and if not, then oh well.  This club's crowd may not be the crowd for me.  They seem to enjoy more of the, how should I put it, ""White"" comedians like Gary Shandling.  I think the only non-white comedian picture they had on the wall was Margeret Cho.   So I bid farewell to Rooster T Feathers and it's cracker-fest.  I guess I'll stick to the clubs that have that certain element I like to call minorities.  Actually, what gets me is that I usually do very well in front of white people.  Its just THESE white people who get don't get me :(  Maybe I should write more puns and analogy's for jokes so they can be pleased.  Actually I think I'm going to start focusing on my acting more than my comedy.  At least for now while I'm in the bay area.  For comedy I will do showcases to keep fresh and competitions and festivals.  As far as getting booked,  my main booker doesnt seem to want to book me anymore seeing as how I haven't heard from him in 2 months and can't get him to take or return my phone calls or emails.  Oh well, it's his loss...right?  *sniff* Please take me back booker.  Well acting is paying more than comedy ever will right now, so I'm happy as long as I got something good going on.  If you read this, sorry it wasn't very funny, I just felt like venting and I was trying to not cuss in case my mom reads it or something."

For some reason, my body likes to mess with me.  I think it's self-destructive, because whenever I get a big gig something happens.  When I did my PlaysStation 2 commercial, the night before I started to lose my voice.  I barely made it through the shoot with the little bit of voice I had.  I had that deep, sexy voice, it was sexy except for every 2 minutes when I had to make that ugly clearing your throat noise.  So I get booked on Friday for this Battlefront commercial that shoots on Monday.  And out of nowhere this gigantic pimple erupts onto the side of my nose.  This is my self-destructive body going to work, because I never get pimples on my nose, and never that big.  This thing looked like a colony had formed.  When I get pimples it's where my facial hair grows as a result of ingrown hairs.  So I am freaking out because I can picture myself showing up and they look at my pimple and are like, yeah, we can't use you in the commercial with that thing on your face.  But the shoot takes place at this ILM studio which is owned by LucasArts and does the special effects and art for hundreds of movies including Star Wars.  So I'm thinking that they can CGI it off my face or make it turn into an ewok or something.  Fortunately, this was a big time shoot, so they had a professional make-up artist there who went to work on it and miraculously made it disappear under 20 coats of makeup.  So the pimple was handled.  Now the shoot was great, and the people from the ad agency and crew were awesome.  It is amazing to see the crew create completely different sets between shots.  Every scene was shot on a greenscreen so that they can add us into the actual Star Wars movie.  The commercial is to show how realistic the game is to the movie and as a result you feel like you in the movie, so it has 6 of us normal people running in scenes from the movie.  There will be 2 commercials made from the shoot and I'll either be running through snow after a stormtrooper or shooting in a jungle at some ewoks.  It was some oscarworthy performances I must say.  So it was a 12 hour shoot which means overtime and some extra cha-ching.  I hate when actors talk about how they have 15 hour days on sets, etc and how its a lot of work.  I did a 12 hour day and did probably 30 minutes of work at the beginning of the day and 10 minutes of work at the end of the day.  In between I chilled and read magazines, took naps, played videogames, read the bible and the koran and then did a comparison essay, so much was accomplished.  I love acting and would probably prefer to act than do comedy full-time.  The money is a lot better and you get treated like a king as opposed to shit in comedy rooms.    Now last night I performed at the Avalon Club in Santa Clara as part of a comedy competition.  This was the second and last week of the ""Pre-Finals"" stage.  Yeah, have you ever heard of a competition with ""PREFINALS"".  I haven't till now.  The competition seems to have lasted about 6 months so it is good to finally be at the end.  I killed that night and will be going to court later this month for first degree...hehehehehe...no.  But I did do very well and placed first out of the five people selected to advance to the finals which will take place this upcoming Tuesday.  Hopefully I win, because otherwise I'd be a loser.  Plus the prize is $1,500 and thats a lot of pokemon cards I can buy with that kind of scratch.  Scratch?  I sound like I'm from the 50's.  So, seeing as how the competition has been dragged out so long, I think that if I win the finals then they'll probably make me advance to the post finals or something.    Well tonight I will be headlining a showcase at Rooster T Feathers in Sunnyvale.  I'm looking forward to it, because if I want to get booked there then I need to do well.  When I sent the owner my tape she said that it wasn't very funny and she didn't hear many laughs.  Which is crazy, because I personally dubbed in a laugh track.  (It's hard to get an audience to come and watch you perform in your living room.)  So once again I will have to jump through some hoops like the good little comedian I am and prove myself to people, club by club.  With my luck there will be only 5 people in the audience and they'll be the waitresses wondering where the hell they went wrong in life to end up serving at a empty club on a wed night.  I'll let you know how it goes..."
186510,4032401,2004-07-25,"This is great.  I finally have a blogger thing.  Now all you people out there can really get to know me deeper than what you can get from my website.  The first thing I want to talk about is my new commercial that I landed.  It's for Star Wars: Battlefront, which I hear is a new videogame that will be coming out on PC, XBOX and PS2.  I'm excited because it's a national commercial that will be played on Cable, Network and in foreign markets.  Plus it's a funny commercial, which hopefully will mean more airtime and MONEY!  This is my second national commercial in the past 2 months.  My last commercial was for PS2 Online.  The videogame industry is being very generous to me lately, which works for me since I've spent hundreds of dollars on videogames and PS2 stuff.  So it's time I got my money back.  The audition for the commercial was great.  I showed up and read the sides and it said that one of the characters was obviously out-of-shape, which is PC for obviously fat.  I knew my chances of getting the commercial just went up 50%.  Usually when I audition for stuff, I try and look as thin as possible, wearing loose shirts and blankets, etc.  Having lost 50 pounds in the past year (Thank you ATKINS), I was worried that I would come across as too anorexic on camera with my 260+ pound body.  So when I read the script I tore off my lose shirt and auditioned in my thin, belly hugging undershirt.  And in auditions they make you do a profile shots where you face the camera then turn to the left and then the right, very similar to a prison line-up where they make you do your profiles.  I don't know if they make everyone do this at an audition or if they did this especially for me to make me feel more at home.  But as I did my profiles, I made sure to try and stick out my stomach to appear as much as Buddha as possible.  Apparantly it worked because I landed the role later that week.  The only bad part is that I was suppose to go down to LA and perform at the Conga Room the same day as the commercial shoot (which is Monday, July 26th).  The show is for consideration to be in this new documentary on latino stand up comedians, called ""standUP"".  Unfortunately, I had to cancel.  Hopefully I can reschedule for the following Monday.  Well this is my first Blog.  I like this.  I will try and post stuff alot and hopefully someone will eventually read it."
186511,4032401,2004-08-15,"So Murphy's Law hit me again. For those of you who don't know what Murphy's Law is, please turn off the computer and go get your GED.  So I had a commercial shoot this Saturday for CISCO Systems. And of course, Friday morning I get sick and throw up. Now, when I throw up, it's not a normal reguritating. I retch with all my might and so when I do, all of the capillaries in my forehead and around my eyes bust. So by the time I'm done, I look like a raccoon who has been beaten with a stick. Once again, before a shoot, whatever can go wrong does go wrong. Before my Playstation commercial, I began losing my voice and barely had enough to spout out the monologue. Before my Star Wars commercial, I got a huge pimple on my nose, a place I never get pimples.  So now I'm spending all of Friday with an Ice Mask on my face looking like a gay Zorro. I'm freaking out, because I can imagine showing up to the shoot and them looking at my face and telling me that I can't do the commercial, because they aren't advertising UGLY.  So Saturday morning I arrive on set at 10:30 AM. Fortunately a lot of the redness has gone down, but it's still visible. The costume designer, Christine, was awesome and relieved my fears by telling me that they have a make-up person to do make-up (duh, what else would they do with that title). I let out a big sigh of relief and a little fart, which made Christine giggle and then gag. The make-up artist caked a layer of make-up on my face and made me pretty. Having all that make-up on, I wish I had my gay Zorro ice mask, because I would have been a hit in San Francisco. I shouldn't have worried about my face though, because if Edward James Olmos can do acting with those huge acne potholes in his face, then they should be able to take care of little blemishes.  It was a long, hard day of work on the set. I got into my security costume and sat around for about 30 minutes. Then I spent 2 minutes signing contracts and then sat around for 30 more minutes, reading my FHM magazine, playing Gameboy, doing mathematical formulas and coming up with a cure for Cancer. I was then summoned onto set to do my first scene.  My first scene was very complicated and required true acting training. I stood behind the security desk and as another actress walked by and delivered her line, she looked at me when she said ""security"" and I nodded at her as she continued to walk by. Now to you people who aren't in the ""biz,"" you probably think that this is an easy task. But you don't realize how many things I have to take into consideration while ""acting"". I have to develop a character. Am I a happy security guard or am I pissed off? Is it a polite nod, or is it a sexual nod? Do I nod and then continue to look outside or do I nod, lick my lips and then continue to stare at her as she walks away looking at her butt. See, acting is so complicated.  My next scene was a close up of me standing behind the security desk. This time I would spout out a few short lines and they will use one of them in the commerical. Some lines include ""more security"" ""more voice"" ""more reliability"" ""more protection"" ""more inside"". So I say these lines over and over using different inflections in my voice. One time I'll be like ""more security"" saying it like a question, and the next time I'll be saying ""more security"" as if I'm demanding it. It's great skill to do this and according to the crew, ""I was brilliant"" and ""could use some deoderant"".  So after about 30 minutes of shooting we wrap the scene and eat lunch which was Italian from a restuarant that I assume is Italian as well. I could have left after my scene, however, I never turn down a free meal because I'm cheap and poor...and Mexican, and we all know minorities don't turn down free food.  After lunch, I gathered my stuff and said my goodbye's. It was 12:30 pm. A whole 2 hour day of shooting. I love the life of an actor. In those two hours I'll make what I make in 2 weeks at my part-time job at the blood bank or in 20 hours of working as a rodeo clown.  So the commercial will be played live on the Cisco website on September 14th at 8:00 AM Pacific time. People world wide will be able to see me as a security guard. The website is  urlLink www.cisco.com/go/isr   You have to register on the site in order to view the wesbcast, which is free to register. So if you want to look at it, log on around 7:30 so you can register. The commercial is to advertise some big time product that Cisco is releasing. And that was my big day on the Cisco Commercial Shoot."
186512,4032401,2004-08-11,"So, I know that I said in my last post last week that I would write what happened in the Avalon Competition that I was in.  Well, I wanted to wait till I got paid before I said anything.  I got paid my $200 prize yesterday, so here it goes.  The Avalon Competition is a big piece of crooked crap.  I rocked the finals and it was obvious to everyone that I should have came in first place, second place at the very least.  On the ""judges"" scorecards, I was tied for first place with the other two comics who placed, yet somehow I mysteriously placed in third.  On the three scorecards, I came in first place on one, second place on another and third place on the last one.  That averages out to second place.  How the hell did I come in third you may ask?  Cuz the freakin competition is ghetto and poorly ran.  The owner of the club and host of the competition went in with the judges when told it was a tie and manipluated them into picking their two favorite comics.  After the show, when the host was talking to the three of us, the owner even came up and told the other two that they were his favorite comics and that he knew they would win when he first saw them perform.  Then this Indian douche looked at me and told me that he had never seen me perform till tonight.   Now I may sound bitter, but if hoping that a club and the owner become bankrupt and have to sell the ghetto club again to new management or that the club burns down to the ground is bitter, then call me bitter.  The owner even looks like a slimeball with his long greesy hair and attitude.  I hope he gets stuck in the worse part of Oakland during a riot, then he'll see how tough he really is in the real world.  And the host was horrible.  He sucks as a wannabe comedian and only hosts because he works for the club.  He is not funny, never starts the show on time and does wayyyy too much time in between comics.  He thinks he's funny, but he just annoys and pisses off everyone in the audience.  Ok, the problem I had with the competition is that they pick three random people from the audience to judge.  They put the fate of $1500 in the hands of three people who know nothing about comedy.  They have no idea which comedians are doing hack or original material.  They don't understand about comedic timing or creativity.  Would it be so hard to get three real judges who actually know something about comedy to judge?  Plus, audiences are stupid and lose objectivity.  The guy who goes last is the one that they all remember and if he does well, then they forget about those who went second or first.   So who won?  Surprise surprise, the guy who went last won.  The guy is a great guy, an old guy who audiences like because he's an old guy who talks about being old, smoking weed, etc etc.  *sarcasm coming up* It's funny though because he has great delivery and well it's funny to see old people talk about sex and weed I guess.  He is my nemesis because he beat me in another competition as well, where he performed last and the audience voted.  I wish I could hate him, but he's a nice guy.  He should have came in third place in my opinion.  The guy who came in second came out of nowhere.  People believed it would be between me, this other guy named Slappy and the guy who came in first.  Nobody had this guy ranked in the top three, except for the stupid judges and owner of the club.  This guy has a dating show on UPN that is pretty new.  His act consists mostly of impersonations.  I believe he ended with impersonations of Arnold Schwartznegger, Jack Nicholson, and Keanu Reeves.  Real original stuff ;)  *wink sarcastic wink*  but audiences love impersonations.  What can I say, you guys are monkeys and impersonations are like bananas cuz it doesn't require you to think.  Now dance monkeys dance.  I feel bad for Slappy, because he should have came in second or third at least, but ended up not even placing.  Of course, he won't say anything because he doesn't want to piss anyone off or burn bridges.  He even congratulated us on the SFComedy Board.  I on the other hand, don't care what bridges I burn in comedy, because there are no bridges in San Francisco, which is why I'm getting tired of having to deal with small time bookers and clubs who think they are big time.  If I had any bridges to burn, then I would be getting gigs and not wasting time in retarded competitions.  Plus this is my blog and I'll rant and rave about what I want since I know nobody but my homeboy in Iraq reads this because he does nothing else but sit on his ass and hide from his boss so he doesnt have to work.  Haha, be safe Kiyo and holla at ya boy!  So I am done with these whack, poorly ran competitions...  Well, actually I did enter another one yesterday.  I am now in the San Jose Improv Battle of the Bay competition.  I did a prelim yesterday and advanced to the quarterfinals.  Honestly, I could have cared less about this competition.  The only reason I did it was because they cancelled the Wednesday showcases there and I needed to get up and remind the guy who books the club who I am so that he'll continue booking me and remember to call me, since he hasn't called in quite awhile.  Fortunately, he caught my set and we talked afterwards and hopefully he'll call.  Otherwise I will continue to stalk him and put horse heads in his bed.  The prelims and quarterfinals are judged by the dreaded audience.  Therefore, whoever has the most friends in the audience wins.  Hence me coming in second place with zero friends in the audience and the guy who placed first being the guy who brought half the audience.  The guy who came in third brought the other half of the audience.  Both of them sucked of course, but what can you do.  My homeboy Tyson should have placed, but he doesn't have friends either and went up early so was forgotten by the end.  If I dont advance it is no big deal and I refuse to let any friends come to the show for the first two rounds when it's audience votes, because I want to advance through impressing strangers.  The semifinals and finals have real judges, so they can come then if they want.   What else is happening?  I will be joining the Screen Actors Guild this upcoming week.  A nice $1453 dent in my pocket.  I did get booked for an industrial film to be shot this Saturday for Cisco Systems, a computer company.  An industrial film are those horrible films that you watch when you get hired at a company.  All of the ones I've seen have terrible acting, so I'm not too worried about my performance.  The industrials I have seen are ones that are about sexual harrassment, etc.  Maybe I'll get lucky will be able to grab someone's ass or something.  I didn't even audition for the part, I was booked off of my headshot, so that was nice because I wasn't expecting it.  Of course my headshot was from when I was 18, so they will have a nice surprise when they see a 50 pound heavier version of me.  And I play a security guard.  I'm quite experienced in this role having worked 2 summers as a security before while in college.  So I guess my life has come full circle from security guard back to security guard (sigh) how sad.  Oh well, money is money and work is work.   Whew, i'm tired from this ranting.  I need to post more so that I can get it out as it happens and don't have it all bottled up.  Oh well, it gives you people something to read if your interested in my life."
186513,4032401,2004-08-02,"Well, today was a great day. I received two, count them TWO gig offers. The first gig was from my booker's company, GFI Entertainment, not Jimmy, who is my main booker, but his parter who does colleges called and offered me a gig in October at Chico State University.  Chico State has a special place in my heart because it was my very first paid college gig and my very first gig with GFI or any booker for that matter. It was the fall of 2001 and I was an emcee doing a show with Shang Forbes and Andrew Norelli, both of whom are good friends of mine now. It was a great show and I did well despite being nervous because this was my first big gig. I was even on the poster, which I thought was the tightest thing ever. My mexican side came out, because I stole a poster to bring home and still have it framed in my room (framing it must come from my white side). Plus I got paid $300 to do 15 minutes. So now I'm thinking, damn, comedy pays really well. This is my first gig and I'm already making $300/night. Of course, I quickly learned that most of my other gigs don't pay nearly this much. Most clubs, not all clubs, but most pay lousy.  They usually pay me in cheddar cheese and bubble gum.  It's the college and corporate gigs that pay the big dinero (that means money in Spanish, geez go to McDonalds sometime and learn some Spanish will ya).  Chico State is also a lot of fun. They have this reputation as a party school, and well...it's a well deserved reputation because they know how to have fun. And when you're out in Chico, CA, I guess there isn't much else to do but party and drink. Chico isn't going to be a big museum and arts place like SF unless all the cows start painting. So Chico is fun, I met alot of cool people there. It's always a nice place when white girls will come up and talk to me. Alot of times they get intimidated around me, or at least until I take my ski mask off.  I'm working on a parody of the Usher song Burn to do. Maybe I can get it polished and bust it out in Chico. Basically the song talks about Burning from Herpes.  The second phone call I received was from the San Diego Comedy Festival. They wanted to know if I would like to perform this week in it. Usually I would have jumped at this chance, because there is a lot of prize money at stake and one can never see too many donkey shows in Tijuana. However, this time I have to say no, because my little brother flies in tomorrow for the week, so I can't drag him down to San Diego. I have to stay here and make him dance for money at Pier 39 in SF. People love when I stand behind him and shout out ""Dance monkey, Dance!"" while he pops and locks.  But he gets a $1 burger after he puts in his 8 hours, so that should keep him happy.  But back to San Diego. They must be hurting for comedians, because I only sent in a registration. I didn't follow up with a press kit because they require a $25 fee and I didn't have $25 to spend. I think we can all agree that midget hookers aren't as cheap as they used to be. They are in high demand these days apparently. So they must be taking anyone, which sucks because that means the competition must not be as tough, making my chance at winning higher.  Tomorrow night is the finals of this Avalon Bay Area Competition that I'm in. I'll keep notes on the other comics and write up an evaluation of the night. It'll either be very positive or very negative, depending on if I win or not. There is $1500 at stake for first place, so I have to bust out the gut buster jokes...well i guess I should write some gut busters first so I can bust them out (HEHEHEHEHE) -imagine me squeeling like a little girl. I have some nice chuckle jokes and jokes that make you go ""Ahh, that's very true. This gentleman on stage has a good point. Not funny, but true nonetheless. Where's the waitress? I'm could use another drink. Don't tell me I don't need another drink! You're not my mother!... Don't touch me. (burp) I have to go pee. I'll be back."" (HEHEHEHEHEHE)"
198009,3908259,2004-08-04,"urlLink http://www.yogasite.com/panicattack.htm   A wonderful article on yoga and panic anxiety disorder. Get a Grip on Panic Attacks by Rolf Sovik  Jeff was sure he was having a heart attack. His heart was pounding faster than it ever had before. His chest ached and the pain radiated toward his left arm. He felt shaky. As he tried to focus on what was happening to him, the world grew distant and unreal. Anxiety welled up. Jeff managed to call his physician, who arranged for quick transport to the emergency room. There, however, a battery of tests failed to reveal the cause of his symptoms. A second attack occurred a few days later, and still no physiological cause could be found. Before long, panic attacks had become part of Jeffâs life.  Recognizing Panic Disorder Everyone sometimes feels anxious for no identifiable reason. At these times we think, âSomething is happeningâI must stay alert.â Panic victims share these feelings, but for them the stakes are higher. Their distress is so overwhelming that the fearful possibilities take on mammoth proportions. âIâm having a heart attack,â they think, or âIâm losing my mind.â We all experience periods of vague anxiety, which often pass without our ever discovering or having to acknowledge the causes. Panic anxiety, however, is the cue for a determined (and often desperate) search for a source.  Panic attacks are characterized by rapidly escalating and overwhelming anxiety. In the beginning, panickers are rarely able to identify what has made them anxious, describing the episodes as occurring âout of the blue.â The attacks are triggered by frightening physical sensations that occur suddenly, much like an unconscious reflex. Among the most common are shortness of breath, a rapid heart rate, heart palpitations, sweating, trembling, a feeling of choking, chest pain, nausea, and dizziness. Frightened sufferers develop painfully sharp sensitivity to these sensations, often making several trips to the emergency room before they finally realize that their symptoms are panic-related.  Physical sensations alone are not the core of the illness. Fearful thoughts, unpleasant emotions, avoidant behaviors, disturbing sensations, and deteriorating relationships all collude with one another to maintain panic. Thoughts such as the fear of dying or of having a mental breakdown are common. Even mild anxiety can trigger an attack, and any disturbing emotion can be interpreted as a precursor to full-fledged panic.  Gradually, the fear of having an attack in public leads the panicker to avoid those placesâa disorder known as agoraphobia. Problems in relationships, which may have been the original source of anxiety, become worse as panic episodes develop. Difficulty with self-assertiveness and with the resolution of conflicts increases. Friends and partners are often frustrated because they cannot understand what is happening.   The Road to Recovery Fortunately, panic disorder can be treated successfully, frequently with a combination of psychotherapy and medication. Panic sufferers are now turning to yoga for help as well, for yoga offers a wide range of stress-reducing tools. An ancient model of recovery can be found in the Yoga Sutra of Patanjali, one which is also embodied in the Four Noble Truths of the Buddha. In its briefest form, this model is an outline of the stages in the healing process, presented here as four questions:  1. What is the nature of the pain that all humans experience? 2. What is the cause of that pain? 3. What will be experienced when the pain is removed? 4. How can the pain be removed?  Yoga tells us that before searching for a cure it is important to look deeply into the nature and causes of illness. It is also important to get an idea of how things will be when symptoms have been removed, because otherwise we may have illusions about what recovery will be like. For example, eliminating anxiety is not the outcome of treatment for panicâthe outcome is the ability to manage anxious feelings. If we rewrite the four questions of the ancient model, focusing on panic attacks, they might read:  1. What is panic disorder? 2. What causes it? 3. What will life be like for the person who has overcome panic attacks? 4. How is recovery accomplished?   Looking for a Cause Biologically oriented physicians have tended to attribute panic symptoms to problems of the nervous system. Jacob DaCosta, a Civil War physician, set the tone when he wrote, âIt seems to me most likely that the heart has become irritable from its overreaction and frequent excitement, and that disordered innervation keeps it so.â This focus on biochemistry and physiology led to the development of tranquilizers.  Not long afterwards, Freud identified a form of anxiety that appeared in discrete, time-limited episodes. âAn anxiety attack of this sort,â he wrote, âmay have linked to it a disturbance of one or more of the bodily functionsâsuch as respiration, heart action, vasomotor innervation, or glandular activity.â Nearly one hundred years later, this focus on the emotional component of panic has resulted in the psychiatric diagnosis called Panic Disorder.  More recently, clinicians have been exploring the role of disturbed breathing in panic attacks. As early as 1950, the physician R. L. Rice maintained that anxiety attacks were often the result, not the cause, of disturbed breathing; now psychotherapies for panic that include breath training are state-of-the-art. (Even so, very little training in this area is available to clinicians.)  Those who are familiar with yoga will recognize the classic body-breath-mind triad in these three points of view. But if a single cause for panic disorder exists, it has yet to be discovered. Instead, these three areas seem to interact with one another, forming feedback loops that grow larger if not addressed in some way.  For example, if someone is afraid of going to public places, then self-esteem plummets, fears increase, opportunities for relationships are limited, and panic-prone factors such as the fear of being labeled âincompetentâ grow. Conversely, if the fear has been overcome, then self-esteem improves, fearful thinking is reduced, opportunities for relationships expand, and panic-prone factors are undermined.   The First Steps to Recovery We have already seen what panic disorder is and we have a general idea of what causes it. Our next step is to discover how yoga, coupled with clinical experience, can help panickers take the steps necessary to recover. The first priority is to manage the frightening physical sensations accompanying panic attacks, because they will make any other work impossible. Panickers walk on pins and needles attempting to avoid the sudden, uncontrollable symptoms of their disorder, and because these involve rapid arousal of the nervous system, it is imperative to find ways to strengthen the nerves and calm anxiety.  Arousal is subtle and is triggered in a number of ways, but the key to calming it is to learn how to âtalkâ to the nerves, how to communicate across the great divide between voluntary and involuntary functioning. Once the panicker has learned to manage involuntary reactions, the sense of being out of control is enormously reduced.  Yoga training can be particularly useful here, for yoga teaches us how to interact with the nervous system. If we want to soothe and strengthen it, we need to learn deep, relaxed yogic breathing. Regardless of the pathways of arousal, breathing is the language of nervous system balance and control.  To illustrate this relationship, imagine how you would react if you were walking along a dark street, and a pointed object were thrust suddenly into your back. You might gasp, then tense your whole body. Gasping is the natural reaction to sudden fear. If you discovered that the attacker was only a friend playing a joke, you might sigh with relief. Then your breath might become agitated as your fear turned to irritation. The way you breathe reflects how you feel.  This relationship between breath and nerves is a two-way street. Just as emotions create changes in breathing, so changing our style of breathing can alter the way we feel. Breathing is the only involuntary function that can be easily and voluntarily controlled. During times of panic, relaxed, controlled breathing will give us immediate access to the nervous system. This means that by changing our breathing, we can change the condition of our nerves when tension disturbs and frightens us. Then, when breathing is relaxed and the panic response has been calmed, the underlying anxiety can be gradually brought to conscious awareness for processing.   Learning Relaxed Breathing Practicing yoga is a good way to learn breathing skills, for it is a gradual process, often needing considerable support over a period of time. Yoga teachers quickly recognize when a student is having trouble (as is often the case with panickers), and they know a wide variety of alternate practices that will help the student master breathing skills.  The ultimate goal of breath training is to make smooth, diaphragmatic breathing a twenty-four hour habit. The corpse pose (lying on the back) and the crocodile pose (lying on the stomach with arms folded under the forehead) are both helpful training postures. Breathing with a ten-pound sandbag on the upper abdomen while lying in the corpse pose will help to strengthen the diaphragm and serve as a reminder to focus on the abdomen as well. In addition, it is helpful if the panicker learns to pay attention to breathing as often as possible during the day. Notice when the breath stops, notice when it jerks, for once an irregularity is obvious, it can be corrected. This practice not only fosters awareness, it makes the relationship between stress and breathing abundantly clear.  Panickers will find that diaphragmatic breathing not only calms the effect of arousal at the time of panic, it also provides an alternative focus for attention, allowing them to focus on their breathing instead of on the panic symptoms. As diaphragmatic breathing becomes a habit, the nervous system is less susceptible to panic in the first place. It usually takes about two weeks to become accustomed to the feeling of diaphragmatic breathing, and about six months of regular practice to make it a habit.   Special Problems in Breath Training There are a few potential problems that panickers may experience during breath training, and it is well for both student and teacher to understand them at the outset. The most common is that panickers have often developed a highly self-vigilant style that can lead to performance anxiety. (âIs it supposed to feel this way?â) Micro-managing has become a way of life to panickers. The teacher needs to be warmâreassuring but firm, letting the practice do the teaching, without becoming over-analytical. Breathing does not need to be perfect to be good enough.  Sometimes panickers carry a great deal of physical tension in their bodies, and in these cases the natural unblocking effect of yoga stretches and postures can be helpful. Releasing abdominal tension while resting between postures promotes deep breathing. Covering the body with a blanket during relaxation and breath training can ease the feeling of being exposed or vulnerable.  A knot may sometimes form in the abdomen during panic attacks, making breathing difficult. As the attack continues hunger for air increases, but despite the need for air the panicker may feel that holding the breath is the way to âcatchâ it. Relaxed, continuous breathing, on the other hand, releases the unconscious tension created by holding the breath, and with practice it is possible to actually breathe through the knot that forms in the stomach during periods of anxiety. As increased awareness makes it possible to recognize tension early, it becomes easier to remain relaxed. To establish a smooth, unbroken flow of breath, the teacher might say, âWhen you come to the end of the inhalation and your abdomen has fully expanded, simply relax and let the exhalation begin. When you come to the end of the exhalation and your abdomen has contracted, simply relax and let the inhalation begin. Let each breath flow into the next breath by relaxing.â  Beyond Diaphragmatic Breathing Many therapists have begun to use breath training in their work with clients, but few have been trained to teach more than the basics of diaphragmatic breathing. Yoga, on the other hand, offers many additional breathing and relaxation skills that can help recovering panickers. Perhaps the most effective of these is nadi shodhanam (channel purification). As its name suggests, nadi shodhanam works to unblock tensions and resistance in the energy-conveying channels of the physical and subtle bodies, thus calming and strengthening sensitive nerves.  Normal breathing carries away wastes and brings in fresh energy with each breath. As energy is brought in, it must be assimilated and distributed efficiently in order to fulfill the purpose of breathing. Thatâs where nadi shodhanam comes in. The process of channel purification slows breathing down and focuses our attention on its flow. At the same time, according to yoga masters, this practice cleanses the subtle vessels through which physical and mental energy is passing. As these vessels become cleaner, energy moves with less effort, and its distribution and assimilation within the mind and body are improved. The result is reduced tension in the nervous system as well as a calmer mind.  Nadi shodhanam is not the only yoga tool for deepening relaxation. Techniques combining postures, breathing, and systematic relaxation kindle a sense of confidence in us no matter how much daily life seems to bend us out of shape. Exercises that relax both muscles and joints, as well as the 61-points relaxation exercise, lead further toward relaxed self-awareness. These techniques can be taught once students are familiar with the beginning practices. (For a detailed description of nadi shodhanam, see the Yoga International reprint âBalancing Active and Receptive Energies: The Practice of Nadi Shodhanam.â  Expanding the Recovery Process Along with breath training, panickers need to begin the process of resolving their fears. Sometimes they do this work on their own or with the help of friends and family members. Often, however, a period of psychotherapy is needed because the worries and stresses that initially contributed to the onset of panic require objective attention. Before treatment these factors are outside of the panickerâs awareness for some reason. As recovery continues, however, they become the proverbial elephant in the living roomâthere is no way to avoid noticing and dealing with them.  Often the stresses that are most difficult to recognize have to do with significant relationships. A question that can elicit awareness is, âAm I avoiding conflicts within myself?â As one panicker continued in recovery, for example, he was able to explain that his younger brother, who was in line to become a co-partner in the family business, was performing very poorly. Despite many signs to the contrary, the younger brother continued to imagine that he was doing well at his work. Addressing this problem raised many fears, for it would affect a complex web of family relationships. As a result, the older brother resisted speaking up and began having panic attacks instead.  There are many possible causes of panic attacksâstressful relationships, past traumas, fear of separation from loved ones are among the most common. One panickerâs attacks began when her husbandâs promotion resulted in his being away from her and their infant twins at night. Pleased about the promotion, the husband had not been willing to see the effect it was having on his family, and the wife had not been able to express her fears directly. In the course of psychotherapy, this woman learned that finding practical ways to expand the scope of awareness and implement stress-reducing changes (ask for them, create them, or compromise for them in some way), although difficult, was the most satisfying process in the entire recovery.  There will inevitably be leaps forward as well as setbacks while recovery continues. This is natural, for the recovering panicker is learning to work with him- or herself in an entirely new way. Whether or not the panicker is undergoing psychotherapy, the psychological insights acquired through yoga can make a profound contribution to this process. A young student once remarked, âYoga stands for You Oughta Get Aware,â because it provides such a wide range of tools to help everyone, including recovering panickers, do just that.  The Role of Meditation In addition to the body and breath, yoga works with emotions, mental images, thoughts, and relationships, seeing them all as part of an integrated whole. During meditation, for example, a normally disturbing image arising in the mind is greeted by a very different reaction than might otherwise be the case. Now the body remains rested and still; the breath sends messages of steadiness and balance to the emotions and nervous system. Though the image might seem upsetting at another time, now the meditator can witness it with equanimity. This neutral reaction allows time and space for the image either to be processed or to pass through the mind without disturbance.  What is more, meditation seems to pace itself; it allows the mind to gradually gather strength before bringing up the images that might prove most frightening or challenging. Trivia can be dismissed, but the thoughts and images that persist are the ones that have important consequences to us. For instance, suppose I begin to recognize a deep-seated unhappiness with my work, but at the same time I see no other way to support my family. This conflict haunts me, affecting my work and frustrating my family relationships. Panickers may force themselves to push such conflicts out of awareness because they cause a discord that seems unresolvable. Meditation will allow them to recognize it with less fear so that they can see their way through the problem.  Conflict Resolution Yoga psychology also suggests many techniques for resolving conflicts, including acknowledging and accepting the conflict in all its depth; recognizing the need for some kind of change; resisting the inclination to act out feelings or to do nothing; exploring alternatives; communicating with others without blaming them; accepting feedback from others; using discrimination in accepting or rejecting alternatives; surrendering to necessary losses; acting with determination; accepting outcomes with equanimity; working calmly on a problem even if a negative outcome, or no outcome, seems inevitable; and letting intuition suggest new possibilities. These strategies are derived from what in yoga are called the yamas and niyamasâthe attitudes toward life that are the basis of all yoga practices.   Finding Refuge in Our True Nature Ultimately, yoga provides a philosophy that places the relationships between body, mind, and spirit in a new perspective. The Bhagavad Gita, a classic yoga text, tells us that âNo one has the power to bring to destruction this unalterable entity [our true inner self]. . . . The body-bearer in everyoneâs body is eternally undestroyable.â Anxiety arises from attachment to passing and impermanent things, but the more we are aware of our own true nature, the less anxious we become.  Yoga gives us a practical tool for working at this level of awarenessâthe mantra. This is a word or phrase that can guide and protect us. It serves as a focus of attention in times of panic, and it is a resting place for awareness leading to our true nature. Through its connection to the deep spiritual resources that lie within us, the mantra pacifies fear and encourages us to persist in the face of disturbing thoughts and upsetting emotions.  We cannot prevent life from changing. Life is inherently unstable. But during periods of change we can have the courage to identify and express our needs. We can look for ways to surrender gracefully to the inevitable. We can trust, through our experience of yoga, that the essential Self within us will guide us through the emotions of change successfully.

198010,3908259,2004-08-03,"I think that it's been important to take stock of my life and make peace with myself. I'm not very good at it. I'm an inpatient pupil at best and a stubborn mule at worst. Learning to live with myself as I am, not as I wish I were, is difficult. Yeah, of course, there are those things I can change, but one thing I have learned in this divorce, is that you can have change of habit forced on you, but given an inch, you revert to your true nature. You have to want the change and sometimes, I just don't know how much I really want it.       Like my weight and the way I look, which ReGina has so forcefully told me that I will keel over if I don't stop obsessing. I understand the obsession. My mother is, and my grandmothers were, heavy-set. I was a skinny person constantly being told to watch what I ate so I didn't look like them when I got older. Then of course, I married Steve, whose mother is anorexic and for whom food is a constant obsession and how you look is too. The woman is over 75 and weighs herself twice a day. Steve was always on me about my weight. The day he told me the 5-10 pounds I had gained made me unattractive to him, was the day I started my obsession in earnest. Six years of him calling me chubsie ubsie on top of my upbringing is a hard habit to break.  And I claim I want to have that lean strong body. But do I?  I want to break this habit of obsessing for sure. It's not healthy, and it is making me manic. I don't want to get depressed looking in a mirror. I don't want to be interested in a man and worry that he won't find me attractive as I am now, not as he'd like me to be. I will always be 5'3"" tall. I will always be curvy. I will always be somewhat prone to pudge. And I am tired of fighting it all the time. I am tired of thinking ""more, more and more"" or ""never good enough"".  I have some ideas about it but I don't know how they will wash at the gym. I think the tendonitis in my arm was a call to arms (so to speak) that I was overdoing it FOR ME. I may be strong enough to lift all that weight but my 43 year old body is screaming ""STOP IT!"" So I will continue weight bearing exercise but not at that level. Some is good for your health all the experts agree. But I don't want to be in pain, have swelling behind my knee, have pain in my wrists from lifting heavy weights, be unable to lift my arm past my waist and be Charlie-horsed all the damned time any more. So do I really want the long lean thin look? I don't know if in my heart I really want it or think I have to have it to be loved. That's a dark corner I'm not sure I'm ready to look in.  I am increasing my yoga and meditation practice. I have been lax about it and I miss it but have done nothing to change it, focusing on the gym. It is too important to my physical, emotional and spiritual health to let it go any longer. I am not going to get crazy about ""doing the pose"" as it's not important to always do it deeply. It's important to have the form and the breath and to just be. In the moment. That's what it's about anyhow.  I am not going to stress if I am a little pudgy. This will be tough. I have critics all around me, namely myself and my mother. But I am not giving up the foods I love. I can eat them less. I can eat smaller portions. But I am not giving them up until the doctor tells me that it's life or death. Because giving them up without that ultimatum, I might as well shrivel up and die.  I am not giving up on a great love. I may never find it and I'm not going to panic about it. But I realize that 6 years has numbed me and jaded me and I can't be that person. I didn't like that person.  I have already given up on drinking cup upon cup of caffeinated coffee. As Phyll said to me today, I am my grandmother's granddaughter. But all that caffeine is just no good for this anxiety-prone woman. So, 1-2 cups in the morning, which I look forward to and then decaf or, as I've found I've gone back to my true nature, tea in the afternoon and evening. Without Singer, it just evolved.  I have got to stop the inner voice telling me to clean up my messes. That voice is Singer. I am not a dirty person. I hate dirty bathroom and kitchens, but clutter never much bothered me. Singer never let me have clutter. And I've been finding myself giving myself the business if my closet was messy or if I had the newspaper in the floor by the loveseat or if I have 6 pairs of shoes all over the house, and feeling guilty about it. What utter nonsense! What I have noticed, is how I've gone back to pre-Singer in that I am allowing the clutter.  I had dinner with Cheryl last Friday and she noticed my blouse and said something to the effect that it was very bright and cheerful and she wasn't used to seeing me in such bright colors and how much it lighted up my face. Pre-Singer, I was prone to rather bright clothing yet he basically culled my wardrobe. I bought the shirt before the divorce but wore it rarely because he hated it. Post-Singer, I am buying more fun clothing again.  Like I said, a habit forced on you will not remain. It's good to be me again."

This is what the website says about the show:    Sometimes true love can be truly annoying. Of course you love your partner, but admit it: there are a couple of things you'd change if you could. Maybe he drinks milk from the carton. Maybe she insists on singing, off key, on long road trips. You've wondered, ""gosh, if only the world knew what I had to put up with...  "" Wonder no more â Bravo has got just the series for you! Things I Hate About You is the show that lets couples document, for all the world to see, one another's most irksome habits and irritating behaviors. Armed with personal video cameras in and outside their home, each partner will capture their opposite doing the little things he or she does that drive them crazy. The video evidence will be presented to a panel of judges who will determine, once and for all, which has the more annoying habits. The more exasperating person will be required to grant one wish to their partner, who will also walk off with a specially-selected prize. Things I Hate About You is hosted by Mo Rocca (The Today Show, The Daily Show with Jon Stewart) and features expert opinions from relationship advisor and author Jacqui Malouf.     So, I'm watching this show and I can certainly say that this couple are more than irritating! I would drown both of them. If I were the other one, I'd want to wait until my partner were asleep and then put him out of his misery. And how they don't do this to each other, I can not fathom. This couple were BOTH just miserable people. A better show? Them in 25 years to see if they haven't killed each other yet."

Is it possible to integrate such characteristics into the hustle and bustle of reality (being the constant rat race all of us are somehow involved in unless you are a bazillionaire)?

234862,3519711,2004-07-10,"i spent ages the other night typing up a post for this blog, only to have errors and it wont show, so here is a somewhat updated and edited version of it:  dear god, this is turning into one of those whiny blogs everyone hates...it was never meant to be this way! but alas, i, like so many ppl in the world, need to vent their frustrations.. and posting it on the internet where no one will read it seems to be a far safer option than violence.  i hate work. now i know everyone says that about their mediocre jobs, but at the moment i realy mean it. i used to grumble about going to work, even tho i knew that when i would get there, it wouldn't be so bad after all. for the past two weeks, i have grumbled about going to work, got to work to find i was right to grumble about going to work, and then finish the day with a headache. today i was so stressed out and upset that i was in tears about going.. i just didn't want to go back. i think my managers got the point that i was pissed off cause they avoided me all day. smart little cookies. i really don't want to be at a place that makes me feel like that. for all its bad points, it used to be a pretty good place to work, but now the managers are bitches and everyone is so depressed and hates being there that the overall atmosphere of the place is horrible. i need to find a new job, and soon.   update: since i wrote that on wed night, thinfs at work have seemed to get a bit better. hopefully they continue to get better, to the point where i enjoy going to work!   on a lighter note: i've spent the past week sleeping next to loki ^_^ its so nice to wake up next to the one you love.. theres something comforting about it. i have to make the most of the next few days with him tho cause i'm gonna be so busy that i won't see much of him the next few weeks!  update: i think i've seen loki 10 nights in a row.. which is the most so far.. and i'm not sick of him, which is a good sign..lol tonight however will probably be the last night i sleep next to him for about a week and a half, cause i have to work more hours than normal, and he's off to AVcon in adelaide for about 4 or 5 days at the end of next week. i really wanted to go along, but i've spent so much money on the film festival which starts in two weeks that i can't afford to spend anymore. i will get to see him on tue when we go laser skirmishin', which should be heaps of fun.  costume update:  i made a cactuar yesterday!! it is sooo cute! ^_^  unfortunately tho, that's all i have made these past couple of weeks.. and i pretty much have no more free days to sew from now until manifest. so i'll be overworking myself with work and sewing till the wee hours of the morn :P  update: still, just a potato."
234863,3519711,2004-07-02,"ok, so i'm in limbo with my hours and pay and such.. they will ""review"" it all at the beginning of august. i had planned to leave in october. at the moment i don't think i'm going anywhere soon. this depresses me. what depresses me even more is that i will be stuck in a job i dont want to be in, but have very little choice cause i need all the money i can get, and i am not willing to sell my body (it seems i have already sold my soul to this company, and possibly my first born, i didn't read the fine print of the work agreement properly).  the new managers started this week, and already they have sucked the life out of the place. the one reason i liked working there was that it wasn't like every other store who did everything by the book, which ended up making life hard for both the customer and the staff, resulting in the staff being abused by an understandably pissed off customer. today i was abused or just generally treated like shit by at least 5 customers.. thats enough to wreck my day. my productivity was questioned because i was too busy serving customers to clean up and put out stock.  shit, i'm sorry i'm making money for you, i'll ignore ppl next time and make sure the place is spotless and stocked up before i even think of looking at a customer, let alone serve them.  i have gone back to not wanting to go to work, which is something i haven't felt for about three months..thanks alot ppl for making my workplace dull, lifeless and stressful.   have shitloads of stuff to do interms of sewing my costumes, but have been too tired lately to do anything. can't make anymore excuses.. i'll have to get my arse into gear tomorrow night, and may have to work on my costumes every night until i get them done.. between this and work i'm a nervous wreck. need to get to japan.. need a holiday!!!!"
234864,3519711,2004-08-12,"IT'S OVER!!!  i was meant to write this up a couple of days ago but i've been preoccupied with my costume for manifest this weekend. because of that, my thoughts are no longer fresh in my head, so i'll most likely forget something i wanted to mention.   short films   with a number of the films i saw, a short film accompanied the feature. i haven't mentioned the films previously, but i thought i would now   the giant (screened with goodbye, dragon inn)  a russian short film about a guy who walks on stilts, who comes to a small town. the film follows his day as the town 'sundial'. there are 12 rocks on the ground to represent the hours, while he stands there on his stilts, with a pointy bird cage on his head. his shadow looks just like a clock hand. a young girl befriends him, helps him out throughout the day, and learns about his past at night through a series of photos that he shows her. (there is no dialogue in the film). in the middle of the night, little shits take his stilts, and he leaves the town, leaving the young girl devastated. a nice short film, nice imagery, and a good story. much enjoyed.   aspiration (screened with bright future)  this was crap. it made no sense. and i discussed it with someone who also saw it and they agreed that it was crap. a guy, for some reason, is attacking his car (which is on the beach) with a hammer, hammering down all the handles and locks. he then gets in the car and the car is washed away. thats the basics of it, tho you have to sit there for five minutes and stare at a guy who is staring into space, while you hear the sea become louder and louder. thats it. boring as all fuck.   talking with angels (screened with hotel)  of if only they had made this into an 82 minute film, and hotel into a 12 minute short film. this is the sad tale of a mother, who clearly has some mental illness of some sort, and her oldest son, who is torn between his embarrassment of her, and his need to protect her from the harsh world that makes fun of her. the mother leaves the house wearing nothing but a lace curtain, and he demands that she put at least a coat on. later in the street, he sees boys his age, and he lags behind his mum, so that they don't connect her to him. then at the doctors, the receptionist makes scathing comments to a patient about her, and he defends her, and later trashes the waiting room in retaliation. if this had enough funding, it could've been a terribly sad, but potentially good feature film. hopefully the director gets funding to do so soon.   guy maddin's sissy boy slap   party (screened with cowards bend the knee)  sissy boy slap party was actually the first of three short films that were all shown together, but it was the one that stuck in my head the most. for some reason, a bunch of topless gay men lie around doing nothing. when the old man leaves, warning ""and no slapping"" a huge slapfest begin, complete with squealing. the slap fest turns rather sexual until they are all lying in a heap, exhausted. for some reason one man's pants are half down, and when the old man comes back her parks his bike in the guys arse. they get scolded and thats the end. strange. the other two i can't even remember, so i can't comment.   best films  my highlights of the festival would definitely have to be (in no particular order):  samaritan girl   bright future   nobody knows   nine souls   get up!   spring, summer, fall, winter... and spring      fuse would have to be my favourite suprise filler film. blood brothers would have to be my favourite dodgy action film. switchblade romance was my fave of the more mainstream films.     worst films  luckily there weren't many on this list, but the worst would have to be:  hotel   goodbye, dragon inn   golden swallow      the rest of the films were all still good, just not stand out. if you were me was on the lower end, with some of the films being good, and others being crappy.     f00dz  i'd have to thank bubble cup, the bun shop in chinatown that i go to, china bar, and hungry jack's for feeding me over the past few weeks. i won't thank flora tho for over priced curry that wasn't very good.  and thats it for another year. i know i'll definitely go again next year, cause even though i get burnt out, i love it. ^_^ its my escapism for the year.   costume update: two more days till manifest. i still have a lot to do, but i'm sure i'll get it done. i'll just have to work my arse off."
234865,3519711,2004-08-08,"didn't go to the film festival on days 14 & 15, as it was loki's  urlLink birthday  on thursday, so i spent that time chillin' with him.   day 16      cowards bend the knee  interesting silent film about a guy who seems to fall in and out of love rather easily. it started off strange, ended up getting even stranger, but wasn't that bad a movie. director guy maddin seems to like to use old film making methods, which is almost a novelty to watch these days. an interesting one to watch.  had more movies planned for this day, but never saw them cause i was too buggered.   day 17      darkness bride  i was expecting this to be a lot darker and eerie than it was. some random virgin who opted to kill herself instead of losing her chastity to a bunch of rapists haunts a small chinese town. another woman, qing hua, has some strange relationship with two men whom she has grown up with all her life. she marries sissy (yes thats his name, and its appropriate), but it seems she like cheung (i think that was his name) better. sissy ends up following his sheep to the city, where he meets the virgin ghost, who has taken the physical form of a prostitute, yan yan. qing and cheung chase after him, and qing is jealous of sissy's relationship with the virgin (btw, its not really clear that she is the ghost at this point, qing just starts rambling on about it, as tho we're meant to know this), and soon both qing and yan yan are competing for both the men's attention. it all ends strangely when yan yan uses the guys for their money, and their paths all seem to split up. i'm not really sure what to make of this film. it was alright, but then it just got weird towards the end.. and the ending was just stupid. not really worth seeing in my opinion.   zatoichi  this would have had to have been one of my most wanted to see of this festival. and it didn't let me down. takeshi kitano's remake of akira kurosawa's  urlLink yojimbo , this was a very enjoyable film. even the strange dancing at the end was good in my opnion. in fact, i really liked how the music was coreographed with the movements of the ppl in the village throughout the whole film. the only problem i had with the film was that it chose to do all the violence in cg. the swords and blood were clearly added, and even tho it was very violent in parts, it didn't affect me cause i didn't find it realistic enough. despite that, it was an excellent film, and seeing that its going to be released here soon, i demand that everyone must see it.   end of the century: the story of the ramones  the ramones have kinda been a part of my musical life all along in the background, tho they've only come to the forefront twice: once when my friend in high school became a punk and subjected us to the ramones at every party, and more recently when my brother really got into them. the documentary really made me dislike most of them. they're all pricks except for joey, johnny is especially an arsehole. he didn't even go to joey's funeral. in fact, i'm amazed they lasted 25 years with all the constant conflict they had. a very interesting documentary that had great live footage. i had to stop myself from singing along with the songs, tho i heard some ppl in the audience do so.   human touch  this film started 30 mins late, so i never saw the end unfortunately.  the token australian film for the festival, human touch was quite a good film from what i saw of it. i believe that it is getting general release here soon, so i think i will have to check it out to see what happens in the end.   breaking news  hong kong action film that was very cool. a shootout is caught on tape and gives the police a bad reputation. the police use the next hostage situation as a chance to manipulate the media in order to make themselves look good again. the main actress had the most annoying large eyebrows since vin diesel's sister in fast and the furious. besides that, a good movie.   spring, summer, fall, winter... and spring  absolutely beautiful story about the life of a korean buddhist monk, the various stages of his life broken up into seasons. written and directed by kim ki duk (samaritan girl), this film may possibly be the best of the festival. nothing was wrong with it. nothing. i just sat there and enjoyed every minute of it.   running on karma  two johnny to films in one day! directed by the same guy who did breaking news, this film was about a monk who could see people's karma just before or after they died. he leaves the monastery to (for some reason) become a beef cake stripper, and ends up determined to save the life of a police woman who has bad karma because of a japanese soldier in ww2. the ending wasn't obvious either, which was good, cause they could have so easily gone that way. andy lau should be banned from muscle suits. he's a rather attractive man, but not ""bulked up"". not as good as breaking news, but still an enjoyable film.  and that was the festival! i didn't go to day 18 cause i didn't book the tickets in time, and all the good movies sold out. silly me. in a couple of days i will post a summary where i will list my highlights, and also review all the short films i saw over the course of the past two weeks. but at the moment i'm up to my eyeballs in sewing with my costumes, and i'm stressing that i'm not gonna get it all done."
234866,3519711,2004-08-04,"i had planned to see about five films yesterday, but between costuming, and getting my haircut, i only managed to see one film. but oh what a film it was!   adventures of iron pussy  now c'mon, how can something with a title like that not be good? actually, it was good in that ""so bad its good"" way. it is the adventures of a thai transvestite crime fighter, that all of a sudden becomes a musical  a third of the way into the film. bad costumes, bad jokes, terrible subtitling (this would have to be the year of bad subtitiling.. did all the good subtitlers get better jobs or something?), it was just hilarious. a must see, especially for a drunken night with friends who have the same bad sense of humour as you do :P"
234867,3519711,2004-08-03,"hotel  what a load of shit. this is most possibly one of the worst movies i have ever seen  in my life, and what makes it more annoying is that it had the potential to be rather good.  its a strange german film about a woman who gets a job at a hotel, where she also lives. the girl before her disappeared suddenly, and she becomes intrigued about why she left. this film is only 82 minutes long. if they added 30 mins of stuff that was actually interesting, this would be an alright movie. so many times you thought something was going to happen, and nothing didn't. i'm gonna tell you what happens cause i'm not spoiling anything, there's nothing to spoil. from the start, they set up an eerie atmosphere around a certain hallway that is so dark you cannot see the end. at one point there is a dream sequence where the woman walks down the hallway to find it leads out to the woods (which are behind the hotel), she then turns around and screams. thats it. nothing else. they could've shown the ""lady of the woods"" (this freaky doll thing which had some legend about a devil's cave in the woods which she haunts, and ppl disappear) attacking her or something, but no. when she finally does go down the hallway, what's there? oh just an end table. A FUCKING END TABLE!! why? why set that up for an hour and then give us a bullshit end table? in the end, she is locked out of the hotel when she is having a smoke outside, so she decides to walk through the woods (as you do at 11 at night). thats it. you assume she is killed. next shot is of a new girl applying for the job. the end. sure, if i wanted to analyse it, i could say that it was all the girl she worked with's fault, who killed her off, as well as the other girl before her, because they were liked more by the owner. but i don't want to analyse it. it was shit. end of story. do not, i repeat, do not waste your time with this film.   nine souls  this was a much anticipated film for me. i absolutely love the director's other film, blue spring (a great movie about japanese high school boys who compete for leadership of the other schoolkids), and had high hopes for this film. it didn't disappoint. the movie is about nine prison esacapees, their past lives, and their desire to fulfil their dreams. the little midget escapist, who was a doctor convicted for 'assisted suicide', was one of my favourite characters. having said that, all the characters were likable in one way or another. and i haven't laughed so loud in a cinema before seeing the ad for ""tightest pussy"" loan agency. great soundtrack too (blue spring also had a good soundtrack that i am still trying to get a hold of). i will definitely keep my eye on this guy for more great films. one of my highlights of the festival."
234868,3519711,2004-08-01,"seeing i got home at 3 this morning, there was no way i cbf posting day 10, so here they are together. actually was two great days of movies, which is always good.   day 10      doppelganger  i don't even know how to explain this film. made by the same director who did bright future, its abotu a guy who has a doppelganger (of course :P), who does everything he has always been to scared to do. the movie changes genres and moods every five seconds, but is very enjoyable. and the ending is very funny.  on a slightly related topic, this movie made me think about all those things i always wanted to do, but either have too great a conscience, or am just too weak and shy to do. i was also thinking about these things cause on  the way to the cinema, i saw my evil ex, and wanted to go and hit him, but didn't cause at the same time i was upset enough being on the opposite side of the road to  him, i didn't really want to be any closer to him.   switchblade romance  i will simply sum it up  the plot like this: french lesbians, lots of blood, circular saw. the film is kinda like a mix between the remake of texas chainsaw massacre and tenebrae.. in fact there are alot of visual elements in this film that reminded me of dario argento's work. my favourite part would have to be when one woman's throat is cut, and you see it open as she breathes.. that was awesome. oh, and a stick wrapped in barbed wire is the coolest makeshift weapon ever. originally titled haute tension (literally meaning high tension), i don't really know why they had to change the name to something so corny for international release. high tension was much more appropriate a title.. my friend and i were tense the whole film, and both jumped at a number of occasions.   battle royale 2: requiem  i have this film on dvd already, but i wanted to see it on the big screen. in my opinion, it looks better on the small screen. in some of the scenes, the camera work is so jolty that i had a massive headache trying to focus. the film is generally weak overall in comparison to the first battle royale film, but its worth it for riki takeuchi's performance as the teacher.    day 11      get up!  japanese men singing james brown... need i say more? ok i will. the main two actors were pigsy and sandy in monkey.. yes thats got you wanting to see this movie now, hasn't it? a very funny film about a yakuza boss who is going to jail in two days, and wants to see his estranged daughter, who happens to manage a group of impersonators. meanwhile, james brown is in japan, and he is a big fan. his friend decides to kidnap james for a private performance for his friend.  paths cross and hilarity ensues. lots of fun. a must watch.   a tale of two sisters  korean horror/thriller film that kinda goes well, then changes mood completely, and then confuses the audience while it tries to explain everything. i think i've seen too many of these films in the past two weeks (and i'm taking loki to see ring 1 &2 on thur for his b'day :P). i am now permanently scared of closets/ built in wardrobes, and asian women with long black hair over their faces and bony hands. there is some beautiful shots in this film tho, great use of colour. but the house is freaky, and so is the stepmum with her almost vertical eyes (and why are all her clothes made of satin? no one owns or wears that much satin, not even hookers!), and the ghosty thing with the red eyes and swinging arm. ok i'm gonna stop now cause i'm reminding myself of all the things that freaked me out, just when i'm about to go to bed...   men suddenly in black  fucking funny hk comedy movie that takes off gangster films.  a group of guys set out to get laid and party while their wives are away in thailand. the first half of this movie is the best, then it kinda stops being funny when the wives come back into the picture. worth a watch just for the ""shootout"" at the cyber cafe. ( the cyber cafe had these awesome giant paintings of anime girls in fan service shots.. they were soo coool)  and that was my craji 48 hours.. sooo tired, and my eyes are a tad sunken... i'm gonna make the most of my 7 1/2 hour sleep tonight!"

At school I lost my Bic pencil, but at least I had my books. We had a sub in Reading so I didn't get to turn in my Comprehension or my rough sketches. I finished my ""G"" in school and home. I finished my homework in time to watch Turtles. It was the one about Rex-1. When I grow up, I will live in the wilderness. I took a bath tonight and during it I thought about double-chins. Double chins make you comfortable-looking, but no second chin makes you beautiful. I'd rather be beautiful.  I started to write a  book  story about a girl named Agatha Amelia.

Now I'm basically famous. :)  Being named ""most radical"" in my hall, July 20. This occurred basically because I dyed my hair red. (Pink would be a more accurate term :).) Right now I have a moon tatoo on my neck. Nifty. But today the girls on my hall kinda flashed F2...I didn't really care to get in on that!! Oh well, can't be  totally  insane...:)  Hanging out with Shannon Caveman. She's basically my best friend here, and we've spent most of our time together. We're in astronomy, so we shared some cloudy cowfields.  Astronomy. We never,  ever  had a clear night in a cowfield. Ever. So we didn't get to do as much as we should have. But we can't control the weather...meanwhile, we watched tons of great movies, like ""2001"" and ""Stargate"" and ""Darkstar"" and ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"". (Klatuu Baratta Nikto, It's so quiet in here, Doolittle - Tastes like chicken! - The earth was without form, lifeless, and I was pleased - Let there be light! - I wouldn't do that if I were you...) - and of course we must have some Star Wars quotes: ""Will somebody get this big walking carpet outta my way?"" ""I have a very bad feeling about this."" ""It's not my fault!"" ""Free us, or die."" ""He's no Jedi."" ""Many of the truths we cling to depend greatly on our own point of view."" ""Strong am I in the Force...but not that strong."" ""Once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny--consume you it will!""  Hanging out with Matt, Mike, and Shannon.  Much to your surprise, I did NOT spend all my time sulking and drooling over guys. (It just happened that I only wrote in my journal during those times.) -- testing a new pen... -- DAMN! Stupid pens're running outta ink!!   Playing piano. I used music to express my feelings when I needed to--it was great.  Talking to Doug Griggs. My problem-solving teacher is  so   cool . I love him! He's insightful & thoughtful. His class has been very challenging!  :)  Seminar. It's been fun, once I got over Drew. Well, I probably won't be  totally  over him, but at least I'm not panting after him.   *INSERTED THOUGHT* : tonight (last night) was the Final Banquet. We sat w/Focus Area. I was across from Matt & next to Shannon. Mike was next to Matt. I was about to mention something about looking for cute waiters when Matt yelled at me, ""Stop lusting!"" I couldn't stop laughing for at least 5 minutes. See, spending time with Matt is  great fun !!   *ANOTHER INSERTED THOUGHT* : Matt wrote that he had something to tell me before we leave. I wonder what he meant. What could he say? I've thought that maybe he's fallen for me, and I wonder how I'd react. I like Matt, but I don't know if I like him  that way . I don't know if I'm hung up on looks, or what. But then again I don't know if that's what he wants to tell me or not.  I remember we were sitting on One-Tree-Hill one night talking about love. He said he's never been in love. I told him about my semi-Duncan love. He said that he was sad about never getting a close relationship with a girl. The thought entered my mind that I could learn over and kiss him and change his life. I know I blushed, and I certainly restrained myself. I don't even know if we like each other.  But anyway...:)    Picture-taking. I've managed to take some good pix, and I hope they'll be sufficient to help me remember GSP.  Scrapbook. I've been saving little items and these I've put in a photo album. I'll put photos in the front.  It'll be cool.   Gonna stop now!"
241505,956611,2004-06-27,"The reader will pardon me, for any change he may see in my writing; for I have adapted my style, to coincide with that of Jane Austin, whose novel, I have finished this afternoon.  In the abovementioned novel it is obvious when two people, are going to be married. There was no surprise at the end, but a happy end notwithstanding. I find that in my life, it is much harder, to perceive the affexions of a member of the opposite sex; their behavior is to me, very baffling. And so it is to no great surprise, that I am dateless this evening for the Showcase. It is not necessarily a fete requiring an escort, but on my part, the escort, will be sorely missed. I refer of course to a particular person, the attentions of whom I have no cause or right to expect, yet my heart longs after him. But after such a grievous mistake as has been made the evening previous, I doubt he pays me any mind at all, except occasionally to shudder, at my impudence and silliness.  I saw him today at dinner, but dared not join him, for I knew none that were in his company; approaching him, therefore, would be forward. I ate in solitude, trying not to allow my eyes, to wander to his table. This was all in vain, since not looking at him is quite impossible.  As I left the room I greeted him in the least civil manner without being rude, and his greeting of me, was matching in its abruptness and apparent lack of interest. I am certain, that he is quite worried to speak to me, as I have lowered myself in front of him so plainly and stupidly. I cannot realize that he may never return my affections, for my life has always been filled with unrealised dreams.  This being said, I would like to assure the reader, that I am perfectly happy with my station in life, and although it brings me sorrow to think that I may always be an old maid, I will try to do a service, to my position in society.   * * *"
241506,956611,2004-06-27,"We just had a very interesting seminar. We talked a lot about politics and the environment and overpopulation and Darwinian theory and poor people and discrimination. It was great. I actually talked!  There's  a shock for you. I was in a really bad mood (mostly over Jason and feeling ugly and stupid) but I feel a lot better now. I was vocal, and my ideas were well thought out. So I feel smart. And a cute guy is sitting by me, and a cute guy agreed with me on things, so I feel attractive.  So...  Here I am, and I feel good now. It's been an okay day.  That's about it..."
241507,956611,2004-06-27,"I never found Alex. My suicidal thoughts and angry feelings about myself are gone. Thank you Midol.  I called AJ last night, collect from a pay phone. I actually wanted to talk to Mom, but she was at work. But talking to AJ was actually good. He is a sweetie.  He & Kristanne rented ""Regarding Henry"" and ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" on Saturday, and watched them at her house. They had a good day, though I didn't.  Oh well. It wasn't the worst day I've ever had.  I still feel bad because I think I really hurt Alex's feelings. I don't know what I can do about it. I'll try to get a hold of a Louisville phone book and find his address. Though I can't pronounce his last name, I'd recognize it if I saw it. I know it started with an ""M"".  Michael tried to tell me that it wasn't my fault. He's such a nice guy. He was too good for me. I lost him because I thought he wasn't."
241508,956611,2004-06-27,"Is it vain to love your own eyes? Mine are so wonderful, and it's so great to have contact lenses so that other people can see them.  They're a lovely shade of blue-grey, speckled almost but gradual enough to be a fuzzy conglomeration of color.  When I came to this convention I didn't think I'd have much to write about. Turns out I have lots to say but no time to say it in!  Gotta go, but will return. -general assembly & dance time!  8:55- I'm back, & I'm not a happy camper. I was so excited before, but now I'm depressed. The thing w/Alex...I didn't get to run for president...I didn't win in Creative Writing. Barf! I must have next to no talent whatsoever. Occasionally I come off with a good line, but the rest of the time I must stink. (At least in timed writings!)  The reader doesn't know about the thing w/Alex, does he? He's a guy who kind of picked me up yesterday when I was depressed. I don't feel like going into the details at this position of the earth's rotation. Why? I'm just too depressed, bud.  So will I go to yonder dance? I haven't any idea. I was going to go & wear my green pants outfit, but now I'm not too sure.  Want to know why I hate pictures? I look ugly when I smile.  I really do. I have a fat face and when I smile, all the fat pouches up and hides my eyes. I would have decently-accentuated cheekbones if I wasn't so overweight.  And to think that this book was supposed to be a romantic tale of the life of a teenager. Tragedy sells, to be sure, but that's not the kind of autobiography I wanted to write. Well, that's life, and things never turn out exactly the way you expect them to. So I might go to that dance and actually have a good time. But most likely I'll just get more depressed, because I'm not a very outgoing person. Oh well--going to try on my pants outfit now. ---  9:13- I'm reverting back into the self-destructive hatred of Heather Aubrey of my sophomore year.  I hate myself! I was so rude to Alex, my writing sucks, Michael never really wanted to date me in the first place, I'm fat, I'm ugly, I'm stupid, and I cry over ignorant things. Like I'm crying now.  I'm such an awful person! No wonder poor Alex never tried to find me after last night.  My hideous ponch sticks out so far I look terrible in my beautiful pants outfit. My waist must be ten inches more around than it should be.  And I thought my creative writing piece was good.  Just shows that I'm stuck up to boot.  I want to call Mom. I think I'll try. No reason for her not to be home, unless she's at work :(  Can't. These phones don't call long-distance.  My butt is so huge! And my flabby face dwarfs the only good thing about me (my eyes), so even they're not beautiful.  I'm not going to eat dinner tonight. I need to lose weight. I'm so ugly. Maybe if I lose 15 pounds I'll look good, but it will probably take more than that. (15 off would only put me at 135, and the average girl of my height should weigh 115. I'm lame, huh, weighing 150 now. That's 35 pounds I have to lose, and of course, I can't do it.  I'm so lazy, dumb, procrastinative, unmotivated, lethargic...I'd need a Thesaurus to cover all the facets of my horrible self.  It's awful being this way and a perfectionist too. Being down on myself makes me even more unattractive than I already am.  Alex was such a nice guy! I'm such an idiot! He was caring enough to offer a depressed girl a place with him at dinner. (That would be me.) He was sweet enough to give someone a quarter to use the telescope out on the river.  He liked Star Wars!!  I'm such a fool!  I was consoling myself earlier with the thought that I'd never see him again, but that's cruel.  I need to go to the dance and find him. Sitting up here rotting over self-hatred isn't going to do me any good. I have to make amends for treating him the way I did!  11:27- I couldn't find Alex. Plus, I had a horrible time at the dance, per my prediction. It's probably my attitude. I expect to have a bad time, and it happens. Maybe someday I'll be able to go to a dance and actually enjoy it.  I'd have to be outrageously thin though, so I could ""shake it"" without flopping my fatrolls. Yuck! Michael says he'll teach me how to dance if I ever want to learn. I might take him up on that.  I was getting suicidal earlier. I hate that. Thought it stopped my sophomore year. But no, it started again this year. Great.  I think it's George coming. Perhaps my bad thoughts will go away. I'm already feeling better because I took 2 Midols.  Malinda (one of my 3 roomies) brought a guy back to the room. Just like I brought Alex back here yesterday. That's so sad.  I think I'll go try to find him again, & then mingle w/ my friends. He should be leaving tonight."
241509,956611,2004-06-27,It started out a bad morning. First I got in trouble for no reason. I had to go to bed.
241510,956611,2004-06-27,"Lion-O is working for Panthro in the workshop. He is going to make a loft. Wily Kat's biking has improved. Today in CatSchool, I bought four animal erasers and ten eraser tops at the store. Cheetara is making marang for the lemon Maringe pie."
241511,956611,2004-06-27,"Today started out great! Guess what? I gave Lou a note (our bus driver) about how the kids on the bus teased us and she made them stop! We got to hear a band play and when we rode on the bus home, Misty was nice to us, and she talked nice with us!  P.S. I got to play with Beth & Amy, and drew with them! Today is great!"
241512,956611,2004-06-27,"I am using all of these pages so I can catch up on the year. Right now I'm at Kitty's. We got her from the cancer place and took her back to her apartment. There, we watched MacGyver.  9:44 PM - Now I'm home. Earlier we went to Randall's, which is behind Little Caesar's across from Kitty's. We bought groceries for Kitty and then, when we got back, ordered a pizza. It was good, and while we ate we watched the very first Superman in the black-and-white series that eventually turned all color. It was neat.  Tomorrow is Dad's birthday. I am giving him an electric shaver with Mom & the boys that cost like 60 bucks. But he won't know that.  Well, now let me explain a bit about myself. I'm 13, but will turn 14 in May this year. I go to school at JCMS (Jessamine County Middle School) and am in 8th grade. I love my teachers. In fact, I always love my teachers.  I'm different from everyone else in that I'm smarter and weirder...or at least I show that I'm weird.  I like to write stories about the Ninja Turtles and Darkwing Duck.  I also like to write essays and poems. I was entered in the Governor's Cup Competition the past two years. In 6th grade I won 2nd place in Distric and Regional competitions but nothing at State. Then in 7th grade I won 4th in District and nothing in Regional. This year I hope to do better.  Another talent I have is drawing. I have been doing this since I was a small child, so I suppose practice helped me get so good. Drawing projects seem fairly easy to me, yet I set my goals so high. And then I'm discouraged if I don't do well.  I suppose I am a creative person. At the end of each school year, some classes give awards to the students. If there's a creative award, I get it. Well, I can't help it although it drives me crazy that that's the main word people associate with me.  Today's Thursday. Yesterday at church people wrote nice things about a certain person on that person's card which was taped to their back. When I read mine, shockingly none of them had written ""creative"". There was ""artistic"" though, and someone even wrote ""pretty"". I wonder if that person had the right girl.  I know I'm not pretty.  As for school, I am pretty well rounded in all subjects. I have Algebra 1, French, Social Studies, Shop, English (Advanced), Art, and Advanced Science, which is the hardest because no one in our class listens and then we fail the tests. But mostly I get A's. I got straight A's on my report card and midterms are coming out next Wednesday.  Maybe you'd like to know what I look like. I have long blond hair that reaches to my waist with bangs so long they're not bangs anymore. I have blue eyes, freckles, accented cheekbones, small eyes, and glasses. As for my body...I have a womanly frame but blubber covering it up.  Pet peeves- rudeness, Satan, people who make fun of classical music, etc.  I LOVE: pizza, the Turtles, Darkwing Duck, painting T-shirts, having parties, root beer, and playing the piano.  Oh.  Did I neglect to mention that I am a pianist?  Well I am. I've been playing for six years, '92 being the seventh. Come Nov. and I'll have reached 7.  I love to read too. My brothers, AJ, 12, and Ben, 10, aren't as interested in books as I am.  Je suis fatiguee (YAWN). It's 10:00. Actually 10:13. I'll need to get up early since there's school tomorrow.  Speaking of school, I need to tell who I hang with!  Surprisingly, the majority of my friends live in Wilmore, a tiny town near Nicholasville, where I live, which is a small town near Lexington. My friends live in Wilmore because their fathers are all going to Asbury College training to be ministers. When they're finished, the family will move away. This has already happened to me and will happen again.  First I'll tell you about Noelle Mitchell. She's my all-time BEST friend, but she lives in Maryland. Her dad's a minister, and she moved away.  We used to do so much stuff! We saw The Little Mermaid, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: Secret of the Ooze, and The Rocketeer in the theater.  Cool! But now she's gone. We call each other long-distance and write letters.  As for other friends, there are: Christy Bremer, who will be moving this year, Melodie Horst, moving, Kristanne Harden, not moving, Tareena ""Teeny"" Mulholland, not moving. Those are my basic friends, but there are lots more. I'm in Frnech with Teeny & Kristanne and we love to parler francais! Our teacher, Madame Fields, est formidable.  My mom is a wonderful person. She comes up with great party ideas. I had a sweatshirt painting party the 20th of Dec. and am planning on having a party where we'll make earrings.  Cool!  Well, I'm tired and there's school tomorrow. It's 10:25, January 9, 1992.  (Dix Vingtquatre, le neuf Janvier, mil neuf cent quatre-vingt douze.)  Well, gotta pray. Be back tomorrow. G'night.

What about mine Wicksy, ya fuckin' wank. your show ends at 11 not 5 past. Go on cry in the car on the way home cause you suck at radio and sound like a tool when you open your mouth.     I hate that Mother Fucker!     On a brighter note I'm going to Splendour in the Grass this weekend Franz Ferdinand, Jurassic 5, Electric 6....

Yeah  I've also been looking for some other blog that would be cool to read but I haven't found one yet that interests me enough.

One is a suit party (wear a suit), the other is an 80's party (wear the shitest thing you can find). I think I'm gonna go to both, I'm not at all keen on the 80's so I'm just gonna wear a suit.

So, anyway, me and my flatmates took advantage of theexcellentt weekend weather and went and flew a kite and kicked a soccer ball around in the park. Who my age flies a kite these days? Me and my flatmates I guess. Maybe we could start a trend, like how young people love lawn bowls now.  Some chick in Sydney got suspended from school for some 'provocative' photos she had of herself in her Blog. I tried to have a look at her thing but it seems to be gone.

It's such a dumb thought.      Last night my flatmates and I talked about what would happen if the train going past across the park exploded or turned into a giant dragon train, with wings and talons. And it lifted off the track up into the air then turned and swooped over us. Then, if you try to shoot it down carriages fall off and turn into mini dragon trains.      Then we had Apple Pie and Apple and Berry Pie and Custard and Whipped Cream and watched the end of Ocean's 11.      Today I went on a site visit for work and at this house they had this clock with a heaps 80's picture of John Farnham on it. It's the funniest thing, I bet they're so proud of it.

It took a 2 1/2 hour meeting to get our point across, but it was done. We are grateful.  All is well.  Today is Father's Day and I was able to visit my father today. That was a good visit.

A meeting at which I've taken the day off work, am printing out pictures of black sambos with watermelons ... all because a webmaster in the church has published on a church website a picture of African American children eating watermelon, and that bothers me.  Depending on when you read this post ... the picture is located at:  urlLink www.campstvincent.org , under ""Camper Fees."" This picture is a stereotypical imagery of the racist watermelon images of 50+ years ago during Jim Crow days. I say depending on when you read this post, because I intend that this picture will ultimately be removed.  For some reason, our webmaster at church, doesn't see this. So ... we're having a meeting today.  I am looking forward to educating this young man about the unintentional effects of racism, and I will be compassionate towards him in understanding that he didn't intentionally post this picture. However, his refusal to remove it, BOTHERS ME. And it bothers others in the parish as well.   Let's hope all goes well."

So for the next 2-3 minutes at the least, I am not too busy to blog my thoughts. That's a tremendous endeavor, I would say!  Today is Wednesday and it looks like it's going to be a good day with the weather.  I have to work today. However, I find that at work my primary function is to organize my MIND, so that I can do all that I have to DO. If the mind is not straight, the action is not straight. This is my experience.  BUSY-NESS (Definition) - the state of being mentally preoccupied with many things at once.  I'm starting my own dictionary. My closest friends tell me I need to do this because I'm come up with words and expressions that they don't understand. Ah well. Like the word, ""WERLD.""

267884,3609838,2004-06-15,"Hello WERLD,  I've come to the conclusion, for today at least, that the most effective way to simplify your life is to say NO to whatever you have to say NO to, no matter what the consequences of that NO is.  I find that I have the tendency to take responsibility for everything and everyone. Enough of that, ya know? I'm convinced that this is why people are overweight. They are holding onto other people's rants, raves, issues, anger, etc., that doesn't belong to THEM. It's like overweight people are sponges for the negativity of the werld. What if overweight people were to really throw their weight around and say, Take THIS! Take THAT! as in take this argument back! take that blame back! Enough already.  I personally am tired of people in my life coming to me, mad ... and saying, YOU! Um, NOOOOO, YOU! I didn't make you mad, YOU made you mad!

I work at the  urlLink Free Library of Philadelphia.  It's a weird place with a fantastic history and wonderful, phenomenal people who work there. But it's still a weird place for some reason ... more on this later?  I have 5 daughters, Jasmine, Amrita, Julia, Kahaja and Tanisha. They breakdown into two sets: Jasmine, Amrita and Julia are my biological children. Kahaja and Tanisha are my foster/adopted daughters.  I'm married ... twice over. My ex-husband is the father of my daughters, and my second husband, Karl, is the father of all of them. Karl's a smart guy. He works for the University of Pennsylvania as a computer support person at the Engineering School there. He knows alot of stuff, but doesn't do much with the information. However, he is definitely someone great to talk to.  I have alot of friends. GOOD FRIENDS. It took a long time to get them! I go to a great church ... job's okay for the most part, alot of good stuff.  I'm very grateful for my life.  Historical note for today:  urlLink Ronald Reagan's funeral  is today."
267886,3609838,2004-08-02,"Hello WERLD:  G.O.A.L.S. is a ""Gathering Of African Americans in Library Service."" It is a professional networking organization that caters to the professional development and enhancement of African American librarians and library workers in the Philadelphia area. We also garner support for and from anyone who works in library service within the African American community.  See my thing is this: affluent communities will always have access to information and those who are commissioned to bring in that information will always be top notch professionals, supported by the best of the best, so to speak.  In urban neighborhoods, this tends to not be the case. Information professionals are not respected, we are not professionally nurtured by our employers. We don't receive information that is applicable to our unique clientele, we tend to get information that is for ""everyone"" and we have to work underground to get to our people informationt that they will respond to.   Just as emergency services and educational services are slow filtering into the urban ""hoods"", so is information services. And without efficient, high quality access to information, it is next to impossible to adequately navigate oneself in this world.  Enters G.O.A.L.S.  G.O.A.L.S. is a mechanism through which black librarians, library workers and others who work in black libraries or information outlets that cater to black clientele can hear their own voices, filter in outside information that they can take back to the hood or their clientele who can use the information. G.O.A.L.S. achieves empowerment of the African American information professional and therefore the empowerment of black people in terms of their information needs.  This organization started two years ago, almost to the date, in Florida at a professional black librarians' conference, held by the Black Caucus of the ALA (BCALA). Myself and my colleague/friend, Angela Willie, were talking in the pool of all places about starting a BCALA Chapter in Philadelphia. I was like: ""Let's do this!""   When I got back to Philly, my mentor, Helen Miller, suggested that I do this ... she said I was the one to do it. So I did.  I got my best buddy/colleague, Darren Cottman on board, along with another mentor of mine, Patricia Kelker, who was a long standing BCALA member and on BCALA's Executive Board ... and we created the first Gathering of African Americans in Library Service meeting at the Free Library of Philadelphia, in November 2002.   Since then we have grown by leaps and bounds, and will continue to do so. And you wanna know why? Because black librarians in Philadelphia are AMAZING PEOPLE. They are well traveled, educated, experienced ... open-minded, excellent writers and scholars, and committed to working in libraries that caters to their people. And if they are not working in an urban library, they are committed to representing their culture to its fullest, without compromise, wherever they are, whatever they are doing. And G.O.A.L.S. lives and breathes because of these awesome people. And it's a no-brainer that when all of them get together ... work together ... share information ... when they GATHER .... INCREDIBLE THINGS HAPPEN.  If you want to learn more about G.O.A.L.S. check out: www.phillygoals.org.  Over and out!"

I may leave my promise untrue, But it had never made me blue, Now I really knew, I had fallen in love with you.  Is this serendipity!? Or part of my fantasy!? No, mustâve been reality, It ended up all my misery.  Even if life is so bad, Meeting you has been glad, Losing you will be sad, Youâre the true love Iâve ever had.  You have done so much for me, You even set my heart free, And made me want to see, The world as it should be.  Thanks for being there, For the love you always share, For being the one who cares, Losing you I really canât bear.  I love you my dear, I really wish you are here, Beside me, oh so near, Sweetest words you want to hear.  So, if today Iâll die, And in earthâs soil I may lie, I do not wish to see you cry, Even if I said my last goodbyesâ¦"

269330,3754226,2004-08-03,"meantime girl   Sheâs the one you call when youâre bored because she makes you laughâ¦ sheâs the one you talk to when youâre feeling down because sheâs willing to lend an ear and be a friendâ¦ Sheâs not the one you call when you need a date to your companyâs Christmas party, or to go dancing with on a Saturday nightâ¦ Sheâs the one you spend time with between girlfriends, before you find ""The One."" You know, the one who you keep around in the meantime.Sheâs not one of the guys, not a tomboy, but you donât look at her as ""real woman"" either. Sheâs not *****y enough, moody enough, or sexy enough to be seen in that light. Sheâs too laid-back, too easily amused by the same things your male buddies are amused by. Sheâs too understandingâ¦ too comfortable --- she doesnât make you feel nervous or excited the way a ""real woman"" does. But sheâs cool, and nice, and funny, and attractive enough that when youâre lonely or horny and need intimate female companionship, sheâll do just fineâ¦You donât have to wine and dine her because she knows the real you already, and you donât have any facades to keep up, no pretenses to preserve. Youâre not trying to get anything of substance out of her. Sheâs not easy, but you know that she cares about you, and is attracted to you, and that sheâll give you the intimacy you need. And you know you donât have to explain yourself or the situationâ¦ that sheâll be able to cope with the fact that this isnât the beginning of a relationship or that thereâs any possibility that you have any real romantic feelings for her. It wonât bother her that youâll get up in the morning, put on your pants, say goodbye, and go on a date with the woman youâve been mooning over for weeks who finally agreed to go out with you. Sheâll settle for a goodbye hug and a promise to call her and tell her how the date went. Sheâs just so coolâ¦ why canât all women be like that?!..But deep down, if you really think about it (which you probably donât because to you, the situation between the two of you isnât important enough to merit any real thought), you know that itâs really not fair. You know that although she would never say it, it hurts her to know that despite all her good points and all the fun you two have, you donât think sheâs good enough to spend any real time with.Sure, itâs mostly her fault, because she doesnât have to give in to your needs --- she could play the hard-to-get-***** like the rest of them do, if she really wanted to. But you and she both know that she probably couldnât pull it off. Maybe sheâs too short, or a little overweight, or has a big birthmark on her forehead, or works at Taco Bell, or just really not that type. Whatever the reason somehow. Life has given her a lot of really great qualities but has left out the ones that men want (or think they want) in a woman. So she remains forever the funny friendâ¦ the steadfast companionâ¦ the secret loverâ¦ and you go on searching for your goddess who will somehow be everything you ever wanted in a woman.Youâll joke to her that she should be the best man at your wedding, and sheâll laugh and make a joke about a smelly rental tux.She doesnât captivate you with her beauty or open doors with her smile. Mainly she blends in with the crowd. Sheâs safe. She doesnât want to be the center of attention and turn the heads of everyone in the room. But she wants to turn someoneâs head. She wants to be special to someone too. We all do.She has feelings. She has a heart. In fact, she probably has a bigger and better heart than any woman youâve ever known because sheâs had a front row seat to ""The Mess That Is Your Life"", and she likes you anyway. She obviously sees something worthwhile and redeeming in you because although youâve given her nothing, absolutely no reason to still be around, she isâ¦"
269331,3754226,2004-08-03,"When someone breaks your heart, you stop believing and you switch off the lights inside your heart. Someone is home but that someone is lying in the dark, in the room farthest from the gate, and that someone can't hear anything. Friends, family, they call out to her from the gate ("" Come out"" which means ""Move on"") but they are unheard, unseen, unacknowledged. When someone breaks your heart, you turn into a small ball of self-pity. You lie in bed, in a ball. You hug your knees, keeping them close to your chest, like a fetus. Freud said its human instinct to go back to the womb where we can feel safe. But that's what happens when someone breaks your heart-they steal the very thing that makes you feel safe, whole, and intact.      So much for all those lines that speak about, quite of âunrequited loveâ, and the need to feel love and be lovedâ¦ the next statements youâll be able to read are all from the heart of a simple girl who was once captivated by the eyes of a person she mistook to be an angelâ¦ then the next morning she woke up, learned how to love, to get hurt, to stand up and be whole again.  What is the sound of my heart breaking?  It is the sound beneath the silenceâ¦ deafening silenceâ¦ that I want to run away just to get rid and get over not of that silence, but of the pain that keeps on maiming my heart whenever I see him smile and the reason is not me.  The sound of the angst I feel for myself, the sound of the voices inside me murmuring, âWhy canât I be like her? If she was me, will he ignore her like he does to me? If I were her, will he love me like he does to her?â I wonderâ¦ I wander in the midst of that dark sky in a sunny afternoon.  It is the sound of the million âOuch! Aray! Awww!âs that keeps on running through my deepest veins. The sound of the breeze of the wind I wanted to catch and grasp in my hand, just as much as I want to hug him tight, so that I will never ever lose himâ¦ which I was never able to do in these 3 long years I have known him and is still, becoming a part of my chapterâ¦  The sound of the love calculator I just checked out for our compatibility, only to find out weâre only 22% compatible, while they are 78%... donât you feel the same feeling of the sound of a thousand miles I wanted to run for me to catch up with 56% more? Nakakahingal yun ah! But then I thought to myself, âBakit hindi? Sa pag-ibig, walang nakakapagodâ¦ walang nakakahingalâ¦ walang nakakauhawâ¦ walang nakakagutomâ¦ pag-ibig ehâ.  It is the sound of a pen striking in a notepad, unstoppable, like I foresee this love of mineâ¦ how it grows at a stronger and uncountable rate each and everyday I thank God I found someone like himâ¦ who inspires me to do my bestâ¦ and to be the greatest pain, the greatest joy, and greatest reason why I am writing this junk stuff. But I stopped for a while and thinkâ¦ if this will be foreverâ¦ isnât that too much to take? Wonât I ever break? I hope notâ¦ I guess notâ¦ why would he if he makes me completeâ¦ despite the fact the he empties the preemptied?  It is the sound of âmessage sending failedâ in my cell phone. I want to txt him, I really want toâ¦ and I failed even though I havenât tried. Thatâs more frustrating, donât you think?  It is the sound of his laughter whenever he gets to talk to her, but a thousand echoes of the broken arrows of cherubim who try to shoot his heart and so he wonât take his eyes off me.  It is the sound of the cracks and grinds of my heart sprinkled with nuisance injected in meâ¦ I wonder if I havenât been immune by this. It happened before, so many times before.  Why am I writing this? I donât know either. There are so many things we think we know, but the truth is, we donât have any idea about it. That is, when weâre in love. Lucky are those who feel the greatest thing weâll ever knowâ¦ to love and be loved in return; one-sided love, lucky too, of course! Because itâs better to have loved and lost than to never love at allâ¦ since the day I learned to breathe, I LIVE TO LOVE.     The experience of love is an inner state. When this is present, you are happy, alive and free. You feel good about yourself and good about life. As you bring the experience of love into your life, life works effortlessly and great things happen.  The opposite of love is fear and upset. When this is present, you close down inside. You lose your creativity and your ability to see clearly. You get tunnel vision and you interact in a way that almost always makes your situation worse.  Whether you live in a state of love or a state of upset depends, not on your circumstances, but on how your relate to your circumstances. A good way to see this is to look at upsets.  Upsets seem to be caused by what happens but they're not. Upsets are caused by your fighting and resisting what happens. To see this in your life, select a recent upset. Now notice what would happen if somehow you were at peace with what happened. There would be no upset.  There would be no upset because upsets aren't caused by what happened. Upsets are caused by fighting and resisting what happened. The moment you take away the fighting and resisting, the upset disappears.  To live in the experience of love, and to create a life that works, you need to stop the fighting and resisting. You do this through a process called ""letting go.""  Letting go is the inner action that releases the fear and upset. The moment you let go, everything seems to change. With the fear and upset gone, you see your situation very differently. You become creative and discover solutions that you could never have seen before.  To let go, you need to do the opposite of fighting and resisting. You need to let go of your demands and expectations for how life should be and make peace with the way life is.  Find what you are resisting. Then give it full permission to be there. If you have a fear of losing a relationship, be willing to lose it. If you are resisting the way someone is, give the person full permission to be that way.  Be willing for anything. Set yourself free inside. Then take whatever action you need to have your life be great.  Keep in mind that letting go is a state of mind and has nothing to do with your actions. Letting go is the process that removes the fear and upset so you can see what action you need to take.  In your heart, you can be willing to lose someone, but in your actions, do everything you can to make sure the person feels so loved that he or she would never want to leave.  To make letting go a little easier, there are several steps you can take. The first is trusting. Trust that no matter what happens, you will be okay. When you know that you will be okay, letting go becomes relatively easy.  Trusting is also telling the truth. You really will be okay no matter what happens. Life is only threatening when you resist. So stop resisting and trust. Trust that no matter what happens, you will be okay.  The second step in the process of letting go is to be willing to feel your hurt. Be willing to feel all the hurt and the feelings of being not okay that your circumstances reactivate. Be willing to feel the hurt of being worthless or not good enough.  The avoidance of this hurt is what makes you resist. Once you are willing to feel this hurt, the need to resist disappears. You can then let go.  For example, Robert had a fear of losing his wife Jan. To make sure she didn't leave, he hung on to her. His hanging on then pushed her further and further away. Robert was afraid of losing Jan because if she left him, this would reactivate all his hurt of feeling not worth loving. To avoid this hurt. He hung on.  Once he was willing to feel his hurt, the loss of Jan ceased to be a treat. He no longer needed to hang on and became willing for her to leave. The moment this happened he changed the way he related to her. Instead of needing Jan, he started treasuring her. Jan then felt so loved and able to be herself, she didn't want to leave.  This is what happens in life. The more you are able to let go and flow with life, the more life takes care of itself. You may not always get what you want, but you can always be free inside. You can restore both your peace of mind and your effectiveness. You can create a life that works."
269332,3754226,2004-08-03,"Love can't do anything for you.  Love, if we're going to be honest, is what you do for others.                    Love may change your life, but it also can ruin it.  Real love won't change you, though.    Biblically, love can overcome anything. I mean here anything. I guess this means that I have to believe in it. But then, I've never experienced true love. It would be hard to believe that some people as what they have felt of known, they have known love. Not in my parents, not in boyfriends, not in friends - not through or from anyone. Because love, contrary to what we all expect, is not perfect. Love is nothing fancy. In the purest form, it's you down on your knees serving another. Love can't make anyone into anything they're not. And if you're honest with yourself, you don't love someone and want them to change, you love them for who they are right then and there, or you've never actually loved them at all, you only loved yourself. Romantic love doesn't mean you'll get to be with that person you love or you get to cuddle with that special someone for a day just to prove that it is love. So maybe you were told love can conquer all. It can, but real love does not seek its own. Some things it will not set out in conquest after, I've seen what love can do and what it can't do; but this I know... REAL love never fails. It's always there, regardless of what happens. It's not circumstantial. The moment it is, it's no longer love. That's what love is to me."
269333,3754226,2004-08-03,"I may have found the abstract side of my ""irrational"" self by this stupid sentiments unleashed. It would not be me if I pretend to be okay even if im not.

The reality ive started to neglect and to reconsider, ive made a dream without this reality of which i wish it were not true. But the opposing forces of my mind keep on colliding that i lost myself for regaining the existing belief, i had started from where i think now is some sort of a lost fate. Now, pitifully, i must say that i have started to earn a degree for myself that instead of me being pulled up, i am pulled down my own esteem of seeing no other that what is obvious and what i think now is abnormal but for him, is VERY NORMAL. Now, how can i face my unpredictable world with me believing that everything is not normal but for him, NOTHING'S CHANGE? well if he thinks that providing a sole time with himself is much better with me clinging into him on a saturday night, simply forgetting to remind me of daily usuals which he unmindfully notices the that everything is not just normal and usual, if he thinks that him not even talking to me for more than five minutes in a day personally is normal, then it provides a n absurd explanation which up to now, i still cannot perceive. I will only see a foolish me crying and wailing over him with a reason i still cannot provide. Now, i now don't even know what to do. Maybe i was just influenced by his abnormality. If only he knew all this, but would he listen?"
271797,3390157,2004-05-19,"I never knew words could tear my heart into peices. Especially coming from my mom. Tonight she basically told me I'm fat, and getting fatter. That i also don't care about my appearance. I'm thinking about trying to be anorexic maybe just for alittle bit. just so i lose some weight, and then ill eat again. If i did that, everything would be better. I have alot of feelings inside that have never come out before. but for some reason they are tonight. I wonder if i became a cutter. would it feel better? would it take the pain away? I need to figure out where the pain is comming from. I still think it goes back to my past with my father.      It's kind of odd, ive never had suicidal thoughts before this. Would people miss me? would they ever notice if im gone? I'm pretty good at hiding whats going on, by staying busy, and trying to be perky and not down. and throwing myself into my music. I am really scared. I just realized im depressed, but i don't want people to know.  I know on one hand i shouldn't be depressed because i have a wonderful boyfriend, im good at playing piano and singing. But on the other hand, im fat, and getting fatter, I have been really sick, and stressed because of all the schoolwork and stuff. I still think if i lost weight, by becomming anorexic, and being a cutter or something, it would make me feel better and erase the pain from all the years.  do I need help? or is this just thoughts running through my head? i don't know are these thoughts that will develop into something? or are they just thoughts and writing is a way to get them out of my head? all i know is that words hurt, and go straight to the heart. You need to be careful about what and how you say things to people. Because like what my mom said to me tonight. I got suicidal thoughts in my head, and she doesn't even realize she did that.    If I wrote what i felt through music would people know what i was going through? would it be to obvious? or not? i don't know but that would help. I have lots of thinking to do. Anorexia, Cutting, Suicide? is it worth it ? to get rid of the pain?"

281647,3342802,2004-05-16,"urlLink Formula fed babies more susceptible to disease, cancer and death   It just doesn't measure up.  Breast is Best... you hear it all the time but doesn't that mean formula is just fine?  Well, actually it does not.  Formula is better than no food, I can agree with that.  But if there is breastmilk to be had, I sincerely believe a baby deserves that breastmilk.  I'm not bashing moms who tried their best and just couldn't breastfeed (although I think faulty advice attributes way too often to weaning).  Not at all.  I can give you hundreds of reasons to breastfeed:  urlLink 101 Reasons to Breastfeed your Child  but you've probably heard them already.  After all, so-and-so is/was formula fed and they are just fine, right?  Well, only time will tell don't you think?  Why not just give your baby the BEST... which happens to be breastmilk.  It is free, and a little effort in establishing a nursing relationship can give you and your baby a special bond that comes not just from skin-to-skin contact and the perfect food, but from your decision to give your baby the BEST there is.  I think it's time for formula companies and prescription/OTC drug companies to stop pushing their wares on the American people.  Starting from the time our children start reading, watching TV, and socializing out in public; they are induated with advertising for formula, drugs that will fix your ailing body, diets that promise to make you look like you had a $4,500 tummy tuck and a boob job, and food that is colored with dyes known to cause hyperactivity and/or lethargy in children and adults.

281654,3342802,2004-06-02,"I've had some comments about my post ""Formula just doesn't measure up"".  I want to address a couple of things.   jenavive said, ""{applause} I agree wholeheartedly!""    Thank you Jenavive.  :)  That's one of the wonderful things about the online world, I am able to find those who agree with me.   Jenni said, ""My last baby REFUSED to take the breast. I tried. I called everyone and every nurse I could think of and he would not do it. He was preemie and I don't think his suck was strong enough. After a week I gave him a bottle. He did fine. My first baby I pumped for a month and he passed away before we could use it, he was very preemie. I donated the milk to the other babies. My middle one would have stayed on the breast for a life time but I couldn't keep up with the demand. I know breast is the best but sometimes you just can't.""    I guess I forgot to say that sometimes there are problems and you have to make a choice.  IMO though, your preemie NEEDED breastmilk even more than a full-term baby.  Mothers of preemies have breastmilk of a different composition, made especially for their babies.  Did you attempt to pump so that your baby could be fed your breastmilk via tube or syringe or even bottle?  I am so sorry that your first baby died, I can only imagine how terrible it was (and I have known loss as my infant brother died of brain cancer complications when I was 9 years old) to loss your son.  You said your middle son would stayed on the breast forever but you couldn't keep up.  Well, breastmilk is supply and demand so restricting nursing will restrict your supply.  Perhaps I'm misunderstanding you... did you mean he nursed too much for you?   GlycoFamily said, ""You go girl! I think we bought our soapbox from the same dealer :)  My sis has a baby who has been in NICU for over 2 weeks. Praise the Lord he goes home tomorrow but my sis was told not to breastfeed (and that includes pumping) because her milk is growing organisms or some crazy mess like that. UGh! I offerred to pump (and already have) for him but my sis said, ""Nah, that's OK. If formula is OK with the neonatologists then it's OK with me.""  BIG SIGH.........  Hope to read you often :)""    I find that horrifying.  Despite medical evidence (and evidence of preemies and babies everywhere), some doctors choose to ignore how vital breastmilk can be for babies.  If we deny a baby breastmilk, we can never know their full potentional.  How can you say, I fed formula and it didn't hurt him?  Your baby misses out on vital brain food that formula just can't provide.  Why would you CHOOSE to deny your baby?      Erin said, ""Well, I would go one step further and say the formula on the market today is junk food. It would be better to make your own from whole food sources. Check out the book Nourishing Traditions for more info. But of course, human milk for human babies... it is so sad women are given poor information/support, and have to suffer through bottle feeding.""    I agree Erin, to a certain extent.  I think formula is gross, but I suppose I am glad it's there for the babies who actually NEED it.  However, before I would give formula I would first choose my pumped milk and if that was unavailable I would use donated milk from friends (or others if I could afford a pastuerizer like Jenn at http://www.feedmybaby.com ).  Then and only then would I give formula.  I wouldn't starve my baby, but I wouldn't choose to feed my baby something that is made for a cow and has to be diluted and then fortified.  BTW, they fortify formula with the cheapest iron available, hence many babies don't even absorb what they need. More comments coming soon.  :)"

The Keeper is made from natural gum rubber and the Mooncup and DivaCup are made from medical grade silicone.  The DivaCup differs slightly in shape from the Mooncup and Keeper.  If you don't like internal protection, cloth pads are great!  Hate stains?  Some brands come in low-impact dyed varieties and pretty prints.  Some brands to try are:  urlLink Lunapads ,  urlLink GladRags  and  urlLink TLC Pads .  Lots of WAHM make pads as well.

295662,3389579,2004-06-08,"Well, my mom is quirky!  I've had good times and lots of great times with her, and I've had bad times with her.  I love her with all my heart, but when I was younger, I always swore I'd never be like her.  Isn't that what all kids say?  It's because when we're kids, we didn't know what was best, as much as we'd like to think we did.  Unfortunately, she did.  She always knew what was best.  She did have my best interests at heart.    Unbeknownst to me, I grew up exactly like her.  I'm neat and clean.  I say quirky things A LOT!  I like to be in charge.  I am a faithful wife (though, in my case, it's only been for a year and for her, it's been 33 years).  I like things done a certain way, and if they're not, I'll change it later.  I like to read.  I like the quiet.  I look a lot like her.  I even find her humor funny when noone else does.  And the list goes on and on.  I don't exactly find these qualities to be bad, but the more they get pointed out to me, the more scared I get.  Not really scared because I don't want them, but scared because I am turning out to be exactly like her.  Justin is always telling me to stop picking on him about cleaning up after himself.  I think I do it because I grew up with the idea that everyone is to fend for yourself, but make sure it's done neatly.  He laughs at me all the time because I have to have the bed made a certain way, and the towels folded just right.  Those are all things my mom instilled in me a long time ago, and I guess I just forgot that it was her that made me do it this way when I was a kid.  Of course I do have a lot of different qualities that she doesn't have, just like she has qualities that I could only wish for.  I just think it's weird how God creates us.  I bet He's laughing right now as I'm writing this blog because I'm shocked to find out about this phenomenon.  I hope you're having fun, God, because I'm gonna take this issue up with you when I meet you someday, hehehe!  Am I weird, or what?"
295663,3389579,2004-06-04,"The one thing I have tried to do since I got out here to California and started working, was portray Christ in my life.  I long to have someone ask me why I don't get upset at some things, or why I don't drink alcohol all the time, or why I am nice to everyone.  Every once in a while do I get someone who will actually ask me about myself and Justin.  I then tell them that Justin is a pastor, and that sparks about a 5 minute conversation.  I hope someday that conversation will be longer.  But working in a non-Christian environment is totally different/harder than I thought.   So...from that, I get this next emotion!  I'm going to kill Alina.  Alina is my manager.  I work directly with her day in and day out.  She is a very cool and intelligent person.  She's from Romania, but speaks 5 different languages, not including uding Romanian.  From what I can tell, things are done differently in her country.  She says all the time how nobody in this country does anything efficiently.  Well, she and I both know that's not totally true, but a majority of our country does just loaf around to the point of major frustration.  Anyway...sometimes she just pushes my buttons, because she's so abrupt.  She continuously gives me things that need to be done in a fashionable manner, but how can I get them done when 5 minutes later she gives me another thing that needs to be done ASAP?  A lot of the time, the things she's giving me are things that she has more time to do and just doesn't want to because it's ""easier"" for me to do it.  And then when things go wrong for her (even if I had nothing to do with it) she yells at everyone.  She does apologize from time to time for being a jerk to me when she is mad at other people.    I am always trying to portray myself in such a way that she will notice I'm different from everyone else.  How can I portray a Christian attitude when she keeps testing my spirit!  I just don't know how to act like it doesn't bother me when she expects/demands me to do things right at that moment and I have a lot of things on my plate.  There is not one bone of patience in her body some times.  How in the world do I portray the image of Christ, when all I want to do is yell at her?  And so goes the saga of working in a non-Christian environment..."
295664,3389579,2004-06-03,"Well, a lot has happened since last week.  It seems like it was a long time ago, but yet it was only 7 days.  Who knows...time sure does fly, but sometimes it seems like it's walking very slowly.    Memorial weekend was a good one for me.  Friday I got to take a half day, and saw ""The Day After Tomorrow.""  It was OK.  It was a good movie, but there were some things that I really questioned.    Saturday, I went shopping and had lunch with my good friend, Angel.  We had our last Saturday night service at Real Life Church!!!!  I am so happy about this one, because now I get to have a husband on Saturdays!  (Someday I'll write about our awesome church, and let you all know what we're up to!)  But anyways, our leadership chose to get rid of our Saturday night service, and add one more, making that 3 services on Sunday mornings.    Sunday, Justin and I went to San Diego with our friends Dan and Angel after church.  We got 2 hotel rooms (one for the girls, one for the boys) at the Hilton.  Sunday was just great, because we got to talk a lot, and we went down to the beach so Justin and Dan could do a little night surfing.  It was very nice!  Then we went to Benihana, thanks to Grandma Dottie (who is this older lady who has taken the four of us in and takes us to dinner all the time), and enjoyed the funny chef.    Monday, ah, Monday...what a day it was!  We got up and went to one of Camp Pendleton's beaches (Camp Pendleton is a Marine/Navy Base), since they are private and Dan (a Marine) got us on.  He wanted to take us there because there wouldn't be a lot of people out, and he and Justin were going to teach us ladies how to surf.  Well, Angel didn't want to, but I did...so I did!  It was hard, but it's really fun.  I did get up 3 times, and so I feel very proud of myself.  I will become good at it eventually, but I will need to practice a lot before that time.  The only downfall to Monday was the fact that I got VERY sunburned.  I got burned so bad, that I had to call in sick on Tuesday because I had a fever from the sunburn.  Oh well...I learned how to surf!  It was awesome!  Since then, it's been just mundane days.  Nothing real special to write about."
295665,3389579,2004-07-30,"So, Justin got hurt on Tuesday night playing softball.  It was actually a pretty scary night, because Justin doesn't get hurt easily and he has a very high threshhold for pain.  This is how it went down.  He was in centerfield, trying to catch a fly ball.  It was going deeper than he was, so he turned to run after it.  About his 3rd step out, he said he felt/heard his hamstring ""pop.""  He fell down and then got up.  At first he said he didn't think it was that bad, so he hobbled to switch places with their catcher, and I met him at home plate.  From behind the fence, I could see him sweating really bad, and his breathing was really labored.  I knew from that, he was in a lot of pain.  So I asked him if he wanted me to take him to the hospital.  Right at that moment, the next batter came up and commented on how he didn't look so good.  He lost all sense of balance and started to fall.  At that point he realized he needed to sit down and I yelled to have someone help him to the dug-out.  The sweating got worse, and all the sudden his eyes started rolling back into his head.  The guys hollared for me to go get my car and take him to the ER.  So I did, and as I was driving up, the guys that were helping him to the car shouted that he was completely gone.  He had fainted from the pain, and was having a hard time staying awake.  They started dumping water on him, to wake him up, and told me to hurry as fast as I could to the hospital.   So, long story short, the ER doctor was stupid and way too hasty.  He diagnosed Justin with a hamstring pull and gave him some weak-strengthed Vicaden.  That was Tuesday.  Yesterday, Justin told me that he needed to go to the doctor, because there was no bruising as of yet, and the pain had not subsided whatsoever.  So I took him to the doctor, and she confirmed what he had been thinking all along.  He had partially torn  his hamstring.  The bad thing is, the doctor said there was nothing he could do for it but wait for it to heal itself.  If it had been torn all the way, he would have had to go to surgery, but it's only torn partially, so there's nothing we can do.   I feel bad, but I'm trying to be the best in-home nurse possible.  He's bed-ridden, because it hurts him too bad to walk, so we are having a lot of down-time at home, which we probably needed.  If anyone has any ideas about how I can make him more comfortable, please let me know.  I'm open to most ideas, so give 'em to me!"
295666,3389579,2004-07-21,"I'm on my own this week.  Justin went back to Illinois to preach at his home church and to do a wedding for a friend from high school.   I couldn't get off work, so I didn't get to go back with him.  I don't really like being home alone.  I actually have never liked it, but at this point, I realize there's nothing I can do about it.      So I have a week full of activities in my action plan.  I work till 5 every night, and then I am planning on going to the gym after after work every night.  Tonight, I have to go back to our old apartment before I can go to the gym.  I have to turn in our keys and I will be hopefully receiving our security deposit back.  Tomorrow night I will be doing a bunch of things, which include hopefully finishing putting everything away in my new apartment.  Friday night, I will be at work for a party that my department is throwing.  And then on Saturday, I am planning on being lazy till I pick Justin up from the airport.  If anyone has any suggestions as to what I should do during my week alone, please feel free to offer them."
295667,3389579,2004-07-16,"Well, Justin and I are all moved into our new apartment!  It's fabulous!  I absolutely love everything about it, except the tiny storage closet on our patio.  This apartment is so much bigger, brighter, and in a great location!         This was the best move ever!  I packed everything, Justin moved it all to the new apartment while I was at work, and a friend of mine unpacked it all for me!  It was the easiest move I've ever gone through!  We only started packing on Saturday, and was moved, unpacked and ready to relax by Thursday night."
295668,3389579,2004-07-13,"I've lived out here for 6 1/2 months, and I haven't seen any celebrities, other than 1 semi-popular soap star.  So, it's been pretty uneventful in that area.  Until last night!  Last night was Justin and I's weekly date night.  He surprised me by getting free tickets to the Mercedes Benz Cup, which is a tennis tournament.  Last night was the opening night, and the night when they do all sorts of fun things.  They invite celebrities to come and play with professionals, and they have singers and all kinds of stuff.    When we got there, we were looking for the table that had our tickets, and we happened to stumble across the celebrity entrance.  There, no more than 5 feet from us was Tom Green and Jillian Barberie.  She's actually a lot shorter than you'd think.  She's about the same heigth as me, maybe even a little shorter.  Then, when we got inside to the court, we learned that the celebrities playing were going to be Dr. Phil, Jon Lovitz, some soap star and the blond girl from 8 Simple Rules (the show that had John Ritter in it before he died).  Wilson Phillips was the opening act, and they were terrible.  They only sang 3 songs, and the only one that sounded any good at all was their hit from the early 90's.  I can't even remember what the name of it was.    So, it was a fun night.  We actually left before it was over, because it actually got boring towards the end of the night.  I was pretty chilly, too, so we took off early.  I was satisfied, though, because we got to see some celebrities finally.  It's cool, but the excitement only lasts for a few minutes.  Oh well.  I had fun."
295669,3389579,2004-07-02,"I never really thought I would have a lot of friends throughout the years that I could go to whenever I needed to, even if I hadn't seen them in a while.  I've recently been experiencing the fact that I do have those friends.  And it makes me feel really nice, because they are GREAT friends.  I really only have 3 ""best"" friends, not including Justin (who is the only person who knows absolutely EVERYTHING about me).  Here they are, in no particular order:  1) Jenni.  Jen and I have known each other since we were 1.  She is best friend in the whole world.  We've been close all of our lives.  It's one of those friendships where we don't need to be all ""clingy"" to each other, but we enjoy every minute of our time together.  When we're not together, we miss each other, but we don't dwell on it.  There are always certain things I can count on when it comes to Jen.  I can always count on getting a call from her and Jewels (her mom) on my birthday, simply so they can sing Happy Birthday.  I can always count on getting an awesome cherry-filled ""candy cane"" bread dish on Christmas Eve.  I can count on her never cutting her hair past her shoulders.  I can count on her to give me a shoulder to cry on, or an ear to listen to, and someone to laugh with.  Jen, you will always be my BBF and I LYLAS!  2) Lindy.  Lin and I have known each other since we were 18 and freshmen at LCC.  We grew closer and closer over the years, and finally in our last 2 years, we were the only ones of our ""group"" left.  So we became even closer.  I know I can always count on her to make me laugh.  To make me jealous because she's beautiful, she's intelligent, and always got cooler things than me.  I know that we will be close friends, even if we never live near each other again.  I love that she calls me for advice.  I usually don't have good answers, but I just feel privileged that she would think of me to ask.  I would always drop anything I'm doing just to talk to her!  3) Greg.  Greg is just one of the nicest people you could ever meet.  He's always willing to listen, to play cards, to just hang out!  He and I met my freshman year at Lincoln, and have been good friends ever since.  It wasn't until my Junior year that we got real close, and I could consider him a best friend.  That's what he still is, though.  I definitely made sure it was okay with Justin when I would want to talk to him on the phone.  When we were still in Lincoln, Greg and I had coffee meetings.  Before Justin and I were together, we would just go on a whim.  Once Justin was in the picture, he would sometimes join, but mostly he just gave me an ok to go with Greg to get coffee and talk.    My number one best friend will always be Justin.  That's one of the reasons why I married him.  I have always felt like I could tell him anything I did or felt or wanted to do, and he would never be judgmental.  He has always supported me in all I do, and I do the same for him.  God blessed me more than I thought was possible when he decided Justin and I would be together.  Thank you, Lord, for bringing Justin into my life, because I've never felt safer.  I have 2 sets of arms wrapped around me at all times...God's and Justin's.  He makes me feel special at all times.  He thinks of me before himself.  He loves me unconditionally.  He's HOT!  He's funny.  He's a great basketball player and golfer.  He's intelligent.  He's HOT!  Thank you, too, Lord, for the friends you've brought into my life.  I am a better person because of them.  I love you!"
295670,3389579,2004-07-01,"I probably won't be around a computer tomorrow, so I just wanted to let everyone know that Tomorrow, Saturday, July 3rd, is Emily York's birthday!  Make sure you either email her a happy birthday note, or call her, or even comment here on my post to let her know you're thinking of her!    Happy Birthday, Em!  I hope it's a good one!"
295671,3389579,2004-07-01,"Occassionally I get those kind of headaches that affect your entire body.  Today I got one that attacked me to the point where I couldn't even see clearly.  Everything was very blurry, and everytime I would squint to see better, it made my head hurt even more.    Then, all the sudden, it just disappeared!  It was wonderful!  I had taken some Tylenol earlier today but it didn't really help.  Then my headache just went away on it's own.  I am very grateful, because it was really getting hard to do anything with my eyes open.  It's kind of easier to work with my eyes open, so I am grateful for the headache to go away."

299691,2968498,2004-06-08,"I cannot get him out of my head. These few days have been thinking about him. I don't really know whether I should feel sad for myself, or empathise. That was why I said, it's not really the right feeling to start a new blog, but I just couldn't help it.  One of my girls came to see me today and bought me cakes. She just couldn't stop thanking me for finding her a job. That kept me floating for a while.   I think I am depressed. Something is really getting into me and as usual, I don't want to find out what is it. Am afraid to know. Gary would tell me, girl, you cannot run away from your problem all the time, you know. I know. Blame it on the hormornes.  When I was chatting with ... you know, I always have a trouble with names =P. Anyway, I was chatting with you know I know (=P), that moment of time, there was nothing much on my mind. It's actually quite peaceful. Until that night. Sigh. Sad.  I need someone to tickle me."
299692,2968498,2004-06-08,"Not suppose to start a new blog with thoughts like this but I really couldn't help it.   Sigh.  Remember the guy from Holland? It's bringing back all the memories. These days, everytime I got out from the shower after washing my hair, I would think of him. I wonder where is he scuba diving right now, aaahhh... I still remember he scuba dives...  That reminded me of the toe. I remembered that was one painful injury. Which reminds me of Ben. Aaahhh... Ben oh Ben oh Ben... wondering does he have kids now. Though it has been gazillion ages already but he still gets into me. Damned that Rolex Ring! I will never forgive him for that, and Jac would tell you WOMAN HE IS INNOCENT! No, he is not :P  Nothing much has been happening lately. It's either work, or I would just come home and chat with him. Nothing much that is happening in between. It's just like the old peaceful days. Days that you miss so much =)  I don't feel good."
299693,2968498,2004-07-22,2 reasons why I love Kin San this week:   i) A lot.  ii) Please disturb me.
299694,2968498,2004-07-21,"I can't believe I am actually on leave. Wow...   I had the most weird dream. But then again I always have weird dreams. Remember Ben? Damn, that dream screwed me up for years and I am still traumatised with that!!   Anyway, I dreamt I was dating Mr. Alien Chang hahahahaha..... MY GAWD! Finally! That dream is so scary not because of him, because of what had happened. Same thing what happened as last night. I am a pain in the ass, aren't I? Anyway, so there I was, running away (as usual, what's new) and he came screaming at me and it so turned me on. I am beginning to believe I am a sadist.  Jealousy is always funny thing to me. Biggest compliment that you can get.   Anyway, Mr. Alien Chang is getting married next year. Wow... that is really something. I just wonder how much sex he is having right now hahaha..... I do miss him at times. Hummmm.....   Good morning =)"
299695,2968498,2004-07-20,"Yeah.... crushed. I don't really know what to say.     When I read that email, my heart stopped for a while. Couldn't understand why. And I came back home and I looked at him and all I can feel was crushed.  Bothered.     And suddenly, I felt something was lost. Now that really scares me.       The other day when we were shopping for Lina's gift, there was this crystal that we saw which was really nice to reduce daydreaming. The girls thought the gift was not appropriate cause Lina is not the daydreaming type and they looked at me. Yeah, I needed that crystal much much more than she does.     I dream too much. But to me it's not a dream. I always tell myself it's real, it's going to be real, I'm going to make it real. It's real. And today..... it just went so unreal. And it reduced me to tears.     And all the bad memories just came back to haunt me. Just couldn't let go."
299696,2968498,2004-07-13,I woke up and saw a red curved line from my left temple across my cheek to the left corner of my mouth. I wet my finger (wet... that is a sensitive word) and rubbed on the red line hoping to wipe it off.   Ouch.
299697,2968498,2004-07-04,"Yesterday I went out with Dinny. She sat with me in the salon for 5 hours! And accompanied me to do my grocery shopping and had dinner with me. Isn't just she so sweet. I look at her and all I can see is Kin San. They are just so fit with each other. I really need to hook them up to know. If and only if I can get Kin San out of the office =/  I heard something crushing today. My feet was being pulled back to ground again today. Not only that, was being watered and fertilised to plant roots to them as well! I am so going to hate him for that.   I need food."
299698,2968498,2004-08-12,Unloved. Uncared for.  Blame it on the weather. Blame it on menstruation.  =(
299699,2968498,2004-08-04,"Knowing he would read this entry I wouldn't know how to write this =) But I remember I did tell myself when I gave him the address that I will not withhold my thoughts no matter what. Hummm... really now...  What I want to say is that I am getting too dependant on him and it's getting really unhealthy. Every night I would come back home and expect him to be with me. If there is something that went wrong, he would be the first person I run to, even on tiny little things. Whenever he is not around, I feel a little lost. Which is so scary.  Did I tell you I told him about how I feel towards him in an email and he went speechless? My thought would be he was not able to feel the same for me. Sometimes I don't really understand what is being withheld. I think it's because they are happy with where they are or they are expecting something better, which I believe the latter applies more. Which is a bit... sad, actually.  I always tell people I am desperate seeking. And I would sit down and laugh to myself, how desperate a person could be being single for more than 2 years already =) But I really am. Just a moment ago I saw Winston. And I was thinking, you sure you want to lead him on? No... I don't want to be with him actually. Something that I learnt from Stanley, you just can't simply settle with anyone. If you want somebody, make sure you are satisfied with it and no regretting. That is like so difficult. Alien would love to call me picky, picky, picky, now that he is getting married. Damn!  I feel lonely. But it's okay. Just go watch your porns, and you would be okay =)"
299700,2968498,2004-08-03,"Loreal Lawyer Loreal Lawyer... I remembered that clearly.  Finally managed to see Kin San. He looked really tired and stressed out. And he looks really really tired. He looked so much older now. He cut his hair. Hummm... doesn't look as good as before... I don't know.  My feelings for him is just not there anymore. Probably didn't see him for too long of a time. I asked him, so what finally determined you to come over to see me, he just said, aaahhhh.... nothing, just didn't see you already for long enough of a time, some 1 year already. 1 year already? Wow. Even the hug was so feelingless. Sad.  Patrick... I want to say something about Patrick but... I don't know. Remembered the time, we were in Tesco, and there was this girl we saw that he cared so much. And I just fell for that! He is really one bad tempered person, but really gentle. He was just nagging me the other day that I have to take care of my physical health and I was like okay okay okay... and he said what okay okay, girl it's your health and you don't even care. He is so cute at times.  And there is Stanley...."

300906,3992888,2004-08-16,"We got cell phones. That was our smallest purchase of the weekend at 1 yen (with a year long contract). Needless to say, they are pretty neat and will serve their purposes in case anything happens to us on the road in a foreign country where we don't know what to say in the middle of nowhere. (It's really not that scary.) By the way, moshi moshi means hello (I think only when you answer cell phones).  Friday after work, Cristina came over and picked me up. I drove in her car under her supervision to make sure that I would know how to drive manual on a mountain with curvy roads. It turns out I do, so I am not as frightened as I was beforehand. That night we went to Kanoya city, the nearby not so city-like or very pretty place, but it is more urban which is kinda nice. We went out with some other JET participants. It was about 8 of us in total. We found that many places were full because this weekend is Obon, a holiday when people go back home to visit their families and remember their ancestors. Finally we found a place and ate. It was all you can eat and drink but I wasnt really that hungry or in the mood to drink (especially after Tokyo -- haven't told you guys about that one). After we ate, we went to a Karaoke Bar. It was not the karaoke booths type of place.  It was actually like a lounge and you told the bar tender the song number and then when your song comes up you get passed a portable microphone.  I did not feel like singing too much although I did do backup vocals to I forget which song.  There were probably about 50 people there, and we probably monopolized the mics most of the night.  The bathroom there was very odd.  At first you open the door and you are in a dark closet that is wallpapered in a dark pattern.  If it weren't for the door knob to the actual bathroom you would think you were in this dark little closet.  Then when you go into the toilet room, there was this apparently famous poster of obscene and lude acts that 1 or 2 people can do in a bathroom stall.  We were at this bar till about 4 a.m. and proceeded to go home.  Two of our friends that were drinking were going to get this special kind of cab that comes with 2 drivers -- one drives the cab and the other drives your car.  (Isnt that neat, they should have this in the States.)  However, since Cristina and I were not drinking we just did it instead.  I felt really comfortable driving the manual car again.  We dropped them off in Kushira and continued to Cristina's house in Higashi-Kushira.  We woke up the next morning and I told Cristina that I felt as if I were hung over.  Because of all the smoke, lack of sleep and dehydration, I felt like I was run over by a truck.  In any case, we went to try to get a cell phone but I forgot my passport (I did not think I needed it, after I yelled at Cristina why did she bring hers, yada yada yada . . . . I'm sure she would enjoy if I went into further detail.)  We the proceeded to go to a cafe with Kaz and her boyfriend Alex who lives in Kagoshima City.  The cafe reminded me of any independent cafe back home -- kind of Top-ish or Satchel-ish (but with blue instead of Green or Yellow) for you Gainesville folk.  Then we went to the 100 yen store (aka dollar store) which is amazing!  Mom, you would go crazy.  They had so many things that we wanted to buy, things that you never even knew you wanted.   These arent like your dollar store back home.  Cristina went a little crazy and spent about 25 dollars, but it was stuff that really helped her place out.  I spent about 5 dollars on a change purse because you get so many coins in change; 1 cent through 5 dollars are coins.  It's not really a change purse but like a U shaped thing that you open and your change slides out.  You see a lot of these in Italy (not for 1 dollar).  I also bought some cool handkerchiefs and some rugs.  Later that night we went over to the Kato house for a big dinner.  It was so much food again and so much fun.   We went back to Cristina's and spent Sunday fixing up her house.  It looks really nice.  We rearranged the furniture and everything really makes sense and feels like it's hers.  Then, we went back to Kanoya and bought cell phones.  Last night Cristina drove me home but since it was kind of late she stayed over and drove to Higashi-Kushira this morning (the sun rises here at about 5 a.m.).  Tomorrow, we leave to Kagoshima City, the capital, to go to our orientation for 3 days.  I pick up Cristina tomorrow morning and head off to the port about 30 mins from Cristina's house to cross the bay to the other peninsula where the Capital is.  (Make sure to see a map of Kagoshima to understand, our prefecture are two side by sude peninsulas that are separated by a bay with a big active volcano in the middle.)  Then, its a short walk from the ferry terminal to our hotels.  The trip is a busuness trip so my passage and stay is paid for.  I even get a daily allowance for food.  I forget what the official word is for this.  Mom, or anyone, if you could remind me it would be great.  Well I believe that is it for now.  Do not be alarmed if I dont write for a few more days.  Oh, and Friday is my welcome party... WOOO HOOO."
300907,3992888,2004-08-13,"So boys and girls, I caught another one.  Minnie Mouse is gone but Speedy Gonzalez is still on the loose.  I went to the rice chest yesterday and placed the glue trap right beneath the drawer before I opened it but Speedy ran and managed not to touch the trap.  Therefore, when I did it again (Minnie was still in the rice chest) I placed the trap more carefully and I caught her by the corner of the trap when she tried to sun out.  I'll save you the gruesome details.  Luckily, today is the day to throw out your paper and other burnables like food and I think that the mouse and trap fell in that category.  I only hope that they don't return it. (I'll explain now.)  Garbage (or gomi) is all recycled or burned here; therefore, it could be somewhat difficult for a foreigner to get in the rhythm of throwing out certain trash on certain days not knowing what gets thrown out with what, when and where.  (It's even more difficult than it sounds, at least in the beginning.)  They have clear bags that are used for paper and other burnables like leftovers and dead mice.  They have green bags for clean plastic; this does not include plastic bottles, those are cleaned and put in a separate bag.  There is a red bag for cans and aluminum (they also must be cleaned before thrown away).  There is also trash bags for clean glass bottles, a day for throwing out furniture and appliances, and a day for throwing out wrapped newspapers and folded up milk and juice cartons.  All the days are rotated and color coded on a big 1 year poster calendar that goes in your kitchen (at least in mine) with a big matching poster index to classify different trash.  Apparently my predecessor had a lot of trouble with this and they would often return her trash for improper splitting methods.  How they were able to tell it was her trash neither I nor her know.  Cristina's predecessor often went to the grocery store and thought that something looked tasty but refused to buy it because he did not know where he would throw away the packaging.  I actually have one bag full of trash that my predecessor left that I do not know what I am going to do with.  Some other things I wanted to share with you.  During lunch time I walk around the port, beach and river to read and eat or just relax.  What I find amazing is that the river here is (now) very shallow and has what we call in the states koi swimming around.  So essentially it looks like a huge water garden.  For those of you who dont know what koi are, they are basically giant brightly colored goldfish.  You can see them feed from the sidewalk and bridge about 15 feet up.  Something funny that happens to me after I come back from lunch is that certain people always ask me what I ate with great curiosity.  They think it's so interesting to see what I do and don't eat.  Side note:  The japanese products that have english on them are so funny.  Yesterday I bought a pack of these chocolate dipped long very thin pretzels.  My predecessor had left me a box of them so I went to buy another box I liked it so much.  Well this time I got the same pack but it was green instead of red and the brand ""Pocky Chocolate"" was modified by ""Men's"". . . so it read ""Men's Pocky Chocolate"".  I found this so funny that I had to take a picture of it.  The only difference was that this was dark chocolate versus milk chocolate (I think . . . I hope).  Last night Cristina was invited to go with this Japanese woman and her two daughters that are Cristina's age.  They went to the ""art festival"" that was at a strip mall type thing but it did not have any art and it had ""popular Japanese food"" like cotton candy.  This was in Koyama, the town between us.  She also saw a fireworks display and enjoyed it very much.  For more details you will have to ask her because I wasn't there.  This afternoon, Cristina is picking me up and we are going to drive to her house together so I can practice.  Tonight we are going to Kanoya, a nearby city.  Well, I'll talk to you later.  I may not have computer access this weekend unless I go to Cristina's so don't be alarmed if I don't write for a few days."
300908,3992888,2004-08-12,"They're back.  Apparently Mickey had some friends.  I like to call them Donald and Minnie who are now together now that Mickey is out of the picture.  Last night as I was waiting to see Back to the Future Part II, I heard the scratching noise I had heard earlier when I thought it was Mickey.  Well, I went to take a look in this cabinet that had a built in rice dispenser thingy (I dont keep any rice in it) and the mice were in there.  I couldnt catch them yesterday so I simply put a fire extinguisher in the way so they cannot get out.  Hopefully I can have someone else try to catch them.  I just couldnt bare setting up the mouse trap and hearing them squeal in the middle of the night.  Guess what I just noticed . . . . somebody left a Mickey Mouse pencil on my desk.  That's pretty funny.  Anyway, didn't do anything too interesting yesterday.  I think I finally mastered hiragana and katakana (the two japanese alphabets).  Also, something weird was happening at work yesterday.  Everyone was very stressed out and frantically talking on the phone.  Then everyone was out for about half the day.  Cristina dined at her boss's house last night and said that she had a great time.  She said she ate some yummy tempura stuff and some great sushi.  Then she had some dessert, gold kiwi (which she liked so much that they gave her some to take home) and a wheat tea that was also very good.  Someone then called her at about 10 p.m. to invite her to Kaz's town of Koyama for the Matsuri and fireworks they are having their tonight.  I don't think I am going because I still don't feel comfortable driving without a cell phone.  This weekend Kaz invited us to meet her in the nearby city of Kanoya (one hour or less away) for some conveyor belt sushi.  For those of you who don't know what this is, it's when you sit at a bar and small plates of sushi come around on a conveyor belt.  Depending on the color of the plate is the price of the sushi.  Then at the end they just look at your number and color of plates and they add it all up.  Then on Saturday we may go to the beach or a coastal drive.  Hopefully Cristina will have her alien registration card by then so we can get cell phones.  Next week we are going to Kagoshima City (state capital) for prefectural orientation Tuesday thru Thursday (all expenses paid except food), but I'll save that story for tomorrow.  CK, you're comment cracked me up.  I miss you so much.  Everytime someone says  Su Goi  (and they say it a lot) I think of you and smile.  As a matter of fact, at the fireworks festival several young people kept saying  su ge  and I told everyone at my office that I thought it was so funny, so they started teaching me all these other slang words and Kagoshima-ben and Uchinoura-ben.  Keep the comments coming.  Email me too.  What's going on in Gainesville?"
300909,3992888,2004-08-11,"Happy Birthday Mom and Raulito!  I wish you the best and wish I could be there.  No more Mickey.  He has left us.  Last night, Kaz, the ALT who lives in Koyama the town in between Cristina and I, met us in my house.  We spoke for a couple of hours and had a great time.  However, when she was about to leave I saw Mickey as I do every night out of the corner of my eye and we tracked him down to behind a small bookcase I have.  I kept an eye on him while Cristina and Kaz handed me the glue traps so that I could put one on either side.  Within seconds the mouse ran and foound itself glued to the trap.  They told me to close it after I caught it so I did but the mouse was still alive (we could hear it squeaking).  So Cristina hit it (understatment) while we made loud noises so she wouldn't hear the mouse.  It gets better because garbage is difficult to understand if you do not know japanese.  Apparently there are 5 different classifications of recyclables that go out on certain days.  Since I still dont know the system, Kaz volunteered to take it to a convenience store where garbage is only classified into burnables and non-burnables.  (We voted burnables.)  Some other interesting happenings yesterday . . . at 10 a.m. I had to introduce myself to town officials in Japanese.  It was fun.  For lunch I had a Gatorade, a fried sweet potato/pumpkin thingy and some fried dumplings.  I know I gorged myself, and the best part is that it was only 3 bucks.  I also got the opportunity of sending for my absentee ballot.   I urge you all to register to vote at this time if you have not already.   I also received my alien registration card which looks just like a driver's license with a goofy picture of me on it.  And, I opened up my bank account in the post office.  Yes, the post office.  I already have the equivalent of 10 cents in it.  As to answer some of Ashley's questions from her comment as I am sure that several of you (if anybody else is reading this) have the same questions. . . . my ""fast as an ostrich"" comment was alluding to Cristina's ridiculous comment (ostrich is the fastest animal on Eartth).  No I did not know how to drive stick shift before Cristina's dad taught me.  I have never had a reason to.  (So you got me on that, but I know how to drive it now.)  As for the car being different . . . it is.  Think of a mini coop or a civic hatch back half the size.  You drive on the opposite side of the road with the wheel on the opposite side AND everytime I get in the car my knees hit the steering wheel.  Add to that the fact that we are driving in the mountains, with ditches that work for gutters so that there are no land slides everytime it rains (the car can get stuck in these, they are deep) and the fact that the roads are narrow with sharp turns.  So it is a bit scary at times.   As for not catching the mouse . . . too late.  I actually thought the same thing, but I cant think that way anymore.  And I pray that there are not any mousey babies around.   I have not seen anybody  eat  anything crazy but I have seen crazy things at the grocery store.  Lots of weird seafood and bags of fish flakes.  The raddishes here are huge.  I also saw some green bread with some brown stuff on it that I want to try but havenet.  Oh actually, the other day with tea I had some omiyage someone brought from Osaka that everyone was skeptical about because it was a sweet made from octopus.  I was good though.  It looked like a ball of dough.  And NO, no one has died from a pucker fish yet as far as I'm aware.  Something neat that I forgot to tell you guys about . . . Yesterday after Cristina went home, Kaz went to go visit the Katos and they called me up.  Apparently they had a makeshift party outside their house.  They were hosting several people from Kanagawa (near South Tokyo) who were here working in the Space Center.  They were cooking outside and made some YakuSoba or SobaYaku, I cant remember.  It's grilled noodles with vegetables meat and seafood.  In my plate during one of my many servings (IT WAS SOOOOO GOOD), I was served this half of an Octopus (that would be 4 tentacles) which I could not bring myself to eat.  Maybe next time.  Well thats it for now.  Jane."
300910,3992888,2004-08-10,"Yesterday I was at work just surfing the net all day. Nothing too exciting. My boss gave me a couple of glue traps so that I can catch Mickey (the mouse that also calls my house home). He seems to be too smart for the traps because he still runs ramapant. Actually, come to think of it a couple of somewhat exciting things happened to me yesterday. For one, I got a copy of the Kagoshima (the name of my state) english newsletter which has the listings of things happening around the state and (drum roll please) a listing of english language movies on TV. Yesterday was Poltergeist but I refused to watch it since I go to sleep with the TV on. I am paranoid enough as it is. My second piece of exciting news is that after work I went with a couple of guys from work to see a 7 meter rocket launched from the space center. It was pretty neat.  As for lunch yesterday, it was somewhat of a dud. It was 2 dollars. I had a teryaki burger. It was better than a chicken pattie but still a little odd, and I also had a bottled soy latte to drink. I did not really like these in Starbucks so I cant imagine why I tried it. I guess curiosity.  An interesting side note about living in rural Japan... at certain times of the day there chimes a song indicating certain times of the day. For example, at 10 a.m. it's Edelweiss from Sound of Music. There others that play at 8 a.m., and 3 and 5 p.m. but I forget what they are now.  As for stickshift . . . luckily I received a very good lesson from the very pacient Ramon (Cristina's father) so I have been able to survive. I am happy to report that this morning I did not stall at all and I even managed to slow down, brake and all that good stuff without thinking about it too much. I look forward to driving to Cristina's soon since all I have been doing now is driving to work and it takes only 5 minutes.  Oh and in special news, I am awarding Ashley with the ""You are the best friend a person could wish for since you are the oly one to actually comment on my web site"" award. I highly encourage for all of you to email me and write comments.   I would like to find out what is going on in Gainesville!   Remember keep in touch. I miss everyone back home alot."
300911,3992888,2004-08-09,"Well I had a good weekend. On Saturday I got up, took a shower, killed a giant spider, then went into the town to see what the paredu (japanese word for parade) was all about. It was really neat. There were people going around the town in groups of 20 or so holding up small gold shrines. They woould either run around in circles or throw it up in the air while going down the streets. People would be spraying water at them with a hose (I guess because it was so hot). Everybody seems to be amazed I dont think its incredibly hot, but it honsetly feels like any summer day in Florida. At one point, one of the leaders of the groups (it was a youndg group) holding up a shrine had them stop and introduce themselves. Some seemed excited, some too shy. I spent a few hours out and about and then returned home to wrap my omiyage (gifts for the office). I spent the rest of the day at home cleaning and fixing up things. Later on, some friendly people stopped by -- the Katos. It was Yu Kato and her sister Kokoro. They were both so nice. Apparently they always adopt the ALT in the town because they are not shy around foreigners and know a little bit of English. The were going to take me to get a cell phone but I still dont have my alien registration card.  Sunday I woke up and watched the news in World News Hour.  It is a program that shows 10-15 min news clips from about 10 different countries.  So I was able to understand the U.S., UK and Italian news.  Cristina then was able to come to my town.  The drive is really not that bad, only 30 minutes and it is very beautiful.  I showed her around Uchinoura and we went to the grocery store to get some sushi and milk tea.  I did not like the milk tea, but I loved the sushi.  Then we drove to Higashi-kushira so I can see where she lived.  The drive back was not that easy because of lack of signs for Cristinas town.  We took a couple of wrong turns and it took about 1 hour to get there.  But we made it.  I didnt like Cristinas town as much as mine (but I still havent seen its shore).  However, I loved her house.  It is small but modern yet traditional.  Everything is new and very accomodating.  She has beautiful horizontal wood paneling all over the entrance of her house.  You first walk in and there is a hallway shaped like a short letter T.  To the right is the toilet room, shower room and utility room (all which are tiled or have wood floors.  To the left is the kitchen with like new appliances.  Then opposite the kitchen you go into the 2 tatami rooms.  Each room is painted green with wood beams.  She has a huge tv and VCR with movies.  Her bedroom has a (drum roll please) a bed.  The only down fall is the fact that her only view is of the rice fields she lives right next to and the mountains in the distance (my town).  After spending some time there, she took me home.  Once home, she dropped me off at the Katos house where I got to roll my own sushi.  They also had me try a meat and potatoes dish and a soy bean paste they call natto.  I also had misu soup.  After that it was off to the rocket matsuri (they are launching a rocket from my towns space center Monday night).  Everyone was gathered at the town square with booths with food, snow cones (i had one), goldfish, masks, etc.  Many women were dressed in kimonos.  There was also a big stage with performances and karaoke.  I was introduced to several people (many of which already knew my name.  At 9 p.m. we went to the port where I saw the most spectacular fire works display.  I guess because they probably dont have many regulations on this stuff and they probably get it really cheap.  It lasted about 40 minutes and the fireworks were bigger than Disneys.  They had ones that exploded different colors and left streaks (like in the states), but they also had some that spinned out of control in mid air or kept on explodiing.  TRULY AMAZING!  Well I gotta go now.  I will speak to you some more soon. Matte ne."
300912,3992888,2004-08-06,"Well, right now I am sitting in my office that overlooks Uchinoura. Hopefully I will be able to post some pictures soon. Well I am sure that most of you are already wondering how life has been so far. Well luckily my predecessor has been here (until a few minutes ago when they took her to the airport). Therefore, life with translations has not been that difficult. Everyone has been really nice and been bowing to me all day long. As a matter of fact some guy on a bike that passed me this morning as I was walking to work gave me a free canned caffe latte (it was surprisingly similar to an iced lightly sweetened latte back home)...think Double Shot but MUCH better.  My house...well, I have a big yard but the outside of the house is a little run down, although I do have a traditional Japanese style roof. As soon as you come in you have a genkan where you take off your shoes to step up to the wooden floor. When you first enter there is a hallway. The first room is a large room with a hard wood floor. It is about 15 feet by 12 feet and is an office type room with a hand sink, lots of windows and a separate entrance... I think its kind of like an efficiancy. This is where I brush my teeth and shave (I will tell you why in a second.) Down the hallway there is my toilet room that is maybe 3.5 feet deep and 2 feet wide. It is really nice but only houses my toilet and a sink the size of a softball that only turn on for 2 seconds (literally) when you pull out the knob. My shower room looks like a utility room and it houses my washer. I had a slug come up the side of my tub on the first day. I was freaking out. My predecessor said she never saw one before in there. My kitchen has very nice light colored hard wood floors and has just about everything I need. The next 3 rooms are in an L shape and all have traditional tatami floors with paper wall and lots of sliding doors. I have two large but short coffee tables with some floor chairs, a tv, built in dresser and armoire, a small wooden dresser with mirror and a wall with floor to ceiling windows. One of the tatami rooms serves as a dining room with a normal 2 person dining set and a small book case. This is the room that the mouse lives in that I see every night and the spider that looks like a tarantula (that big too) but is fast like an ostrich. I am thinking of perhaps gardening because everyone here does it but I guess since my house was always for the foreigner that the foreigner never gardened.  Speaking about my town, almost everyones house is traditional (think Last Samurai) with incredible gardens of vegetables, flowers and bonsai. The town is surrounded by these beatiful lush green mountains which meet the sky (I still have not seen their peaks). The town hall where I work si pretty impressive for the size of the town at four stories high (it looks like something out of EPCOT). A little ways down they are building a town center that is the size of the ODome in Gainesville or the Miami Arena which is also impressive. The water in the beaches are blue and crystal clear from what I have seen as I drive next to them (I still have not gone).  A quick comment about the food (SO GOOD!). Today I had sushi 6 pieces and two rice pastry balls (not sure what that is) for about 2.50 american. I bought it at the grocery store ACOOP. They also have fresh sashimi there for about 6-9 dollars. At work they make fresh green tea and coffee at least twice sometimes 3 times a day. I also had ramen yesterday at a small shop that is not like your ramen back home. It was made with fat wheat noodles soaked in this delicious broth of green onions, garlic and (real fatty) pork.  Well thats it for now. Ive been sending out some emails but have not received any replys. I think that my aol may not be receiving new emails. So therefore try to post comments on this web site until I can get a new email. Talk to you probably next Monday because I still dont have Internet at home. (The school computer guy fell off a cliff while fishing, I am not sure what is going on with that). Oh, and this weekend there is a town festival that they keep on inviting me too. My boss asked me to sing kareoke there (I dont know about that... he said YOU SING AMERICAN SONG KAREOKE). Who knows maybe, what do I have to lose.  Oh and I speak with Cristina every night. I still havent seen her because she had her welcome party yesterday and still doesnt have access to her car but perhaps soon. I speak to her every day though."
308258,4199699,2004-08-22,"August 22nd...     I had something that wiil be on my list of the most  memorable moment in my life... Or I can say... Moment when i feel the presence  and the plan He's been working on me...     It all start from Yesterday...      As usually I went to my church for the youth  fellowship every Saturday night at 7 p.m. That day I was told that today I'll  have to be on a meeting with all the rest of the committee in the church... I'll  have to represent the youth commitee since I'm the president. It's a regular  meeting held every three months. That time I said that I'll be on church  tomorrow which is today...     Now the story is getting nearer to the problem..       Later that night around 11 p.m. I received a sms  from a friend asking me to go to Carita beach with him the next day which is  today...     The problem is that I already promised to be on  church to follow the meeting..     That time I was faced with two options... It's  whether I keep my promise to be on the meeting or having fun with my friends  which is a rare thing.. Cause I don't spend much time going out with  him...     I must admit that time I was really fond of going to  the beach.. To be honest I never go there before.. Moreover, usually on the  meeting I only need about 15 minutes to report and the rest 2 hour will be used  on things that have nothing to do with my commitee...     So.. I start preparing the war tactics.. I called my  friend... I told him that I'll be going with him to Carita... I prepared my  report and decided to have my sister to give it indirectly to the person in  charge with the meeting...     I finally finished my report around 12 a.m.  midnight... Even I have to had this phone call from a girl I just knew... I  finished my report and I enjoyed the conversation... (Probably i'll put some  writings bout her)     And the plan worked really well... There was no  phone call or sms asking me to go to church.. But it seems that GOD has  different plan for me...     Suddenly my friend called me and said that we got  new company and this person is the sister of my other friend's girlfriend... GET  it??? Ok then.. Well the point is they can't say no to her.. And I have to give  my place... At this point I was really upset with my friend but I never want to  spend my time cryin' on my lowest mood... I always look on the brighter  side..     SEE.. This means that GOD wants me to do my duty and  wants me to be His servant.. Be at the meeting and do my president servant  job... I must admit that time something 'clicked' in my mind... I realize a  couple days ago I just made my promise to serve HIM more and do more to change  my bad attitude.. Well He placed me on the right track... See... If I still  persist to went to the beach probably my position as president will be  questioned... Even though I want to do my best to develop the youth fellowship  they will still questioned my commitment and this is not a good example for  those who's still in my committee team...      And I realize that moment I was making the report...  I really put all my thought and my concern on church.. I can't let others to do  this for me... This is my responsibility...      Well... Let's spend less time talking... ^__^ the  point is I believe GOD is preparing HIs plan for me.. and I shall follow HIs  path for I put my faith in HIM.. There's only one saviour for me, Jesus  Christ... Amen..."
308259,4199699,2004-08-19,"Right now I'm feelin' that I want to write  something in English. I don't know why... it just feels better to write it  down  in English...     Today...     August 16th, 2004  Something happened to me and I think this  will be the one thing that will  change  my life... This is  will change the way I  look over  some things in my  life...              It just happened to me that I went to sleep at    5 a.m   this morning and woke up at 12 or  1 p.m.... I forgot... (see... i forgot the time i  woke up ..   this is the start of the whole things that i want to  write down) Have shower  and stuff ...  and my mom asked  me to go to the nearest  ATM... and I did went there... On my way back... I met my friends while i was  still riding  my Karisma... and just said 'HI' to    each other... And suddenly one of my friends called my up and I only  had a chance to say "" wazz up?""    At that time I  didn't really notice that he was taking  someone with  him...   Then... I arrived.. parked my Karisma just in front of my  house... and suddenly he stopped also a couple of seconds after... And I  saw him with a girl... And here's the story begins...  I can't deny that  girl was   gorgeous   and in that couple of     miliseconds   moment I just had my eyes  on her ...      I don't usually look at girls like that... I  know.. Usually when I go out with friends and meet some pretty chicks... I  just u know  admire their beauty.. I enjoy it.... and it goes just like  that.. but this time it's different...  And you know what... I'm a kind of  person who usually get things  when I   'clicked'   with that thing... For example.. I never really  look  for clothes... I usually just walk around shopping places and  when  I find something that 'clicked' my mind ...  and at that  specific moment I know that  ""this shirt is the right  one""....  and that's how I got most of my clothes..  And the same  thing goes here... As I said earlier... I never had that  'clicked' chemistry  when I look at girls until this afternoon...   DAMN..          well, the problem is I  don't know whether she's taken or not... I don't know whether she's going out  with my friend..  I think they have been seeing each other for some time...  cause if not so why do my friend bothers taking her home... and I know my  friend He's not so different from me... Still single until now... still  waitin'  for 'the one' and I think he got it......  Well, here's what I  feel right now...  The feeling of   'in  between' ...  The 'grey' side of black and white.... I surely  got that   milisecond 'click' chemistry  with that  girl... And  I am single .. can't deny that... Can't lie that I've  been longing for that someone... That will fill my days with new things...   Someone to share my love that almost overload...   Someone to care about and  care about me more than  just friend..  Right now... I just can say to myself... you know  you'll find the one when the moment comes...   I'll still look and try my  ways to find that someone..  And moreover... I don't want to wait longer to  start a relationship.. I need to make a step...  Luckily I had    great friends   that able to fill my days..  and makes me survive until now... but I think I'm on the edge right  know... I probably won't be able to hold on anymore longer....  For all  this talks... on top all... for now..    I'm all-right..  That's right..      I'm  CHILL..."

312473,3879618,2004-07-26,"Woke with her in my arms, her lashes flashing, chocolate swirling eyes.  ""You are the Charmed Ones,"" the woman said prophetically.  She & I, always on the edge of rocking out destiny.  Her hair falling, her skin softening on mine.  My lips slip against her forehead.  Still haven't opened my eyes, but I feel the morning light seeping into our pile of flesh & feathers."
312474,3879618,2004-07-19,"A piece of my breath is still jumping across river rocks.  Some liquid spray of sunshine threatens to leap from my belly and escape these velvet curtains into the night.     We basked under the Sycamore trees.  I didn't even notice the battlewounds of the boulder scramble.  These thighs, these hands, they love the granite, every crevice and slick slant into water below.  And his shoulders glistened & his feet gripped the edges.  And the others laughed, voices tumbling down the canyon.  Soon enough, we gathered under the rustling leaves & orange peels fell from the flesh.  A dusty white moon in azure sky rewarded our efforts.  The waterfall's mist mingled with my skin's sweat.  And I felt glad."
312475,3879618,2004-07-12,"Lovely days.  Making licorice and ginger tinctures, a little drumming, a lot of wrestling and more laughter than I can remember.  He read me Mary Oliver poems & I admired the water filtration system on his van cooler.  A drunken, wise Creole spirit -  wandering from Bakersfield, CA - espoused the beauty of a good woman under the street lamp.  His eyes wide & bloodshot, his smile brightly weathered & knowing, like a vagrant angel reminding the Everydayers of the sacred essentials.  ""If I had a woman like that, I'd follow her wherever she go.  I'd make sure I be by her side, boy.  Don't let a love like that slip you by.""  We laughed.  What a romantic.  My mind can't follow that path again yet, but I reveled in every second of his passion pulpit."
312476,3879618,2004-07-12,"Shall I enjoy the missing while I can still remember the tastes & smells & softness in the air between us?  Will it fade?  Will eight years of touch become a dust-covered epic in the attic of my mind?  Can lives so-entwined unravel like that?  They do.  We have only the moment.  Everything else is dead.  Is that why I keep memories so close to my heart, why I visit them like old friends not to be left unattended for too long?  The mind is so immense.  So much lost in the corridors.  Yet the heart can hardly tell waking from dreaming & these sensate memories of ripened affection and acceptance feel more real than a disjunct dinner conversation.  Shall I be grateful that real love is close enough to mourn?   Have I always cried like this?  At ease in my heart, some piece of Loss stirring.  Soft light.  My feet on the couch.  Music.  Black cat sleepily sinking into the wooden floor.  The congas across the room know my joy will turn.  They're not worried."
312477,3879618,2004-07-09,"Last night Matthew & I looked at pictures in the car under a street lamp.  One year ago.  Literally dancing in the rain (and later the help of a garden hose).  Clothes transparent, sticking to skin and thighs.  Clumps of hair streaking faces.  Dancing like dogs shaking off a swim; all captured in glossy.  Those lovers gone now.  On our way to see a period romance at Rincon Theater.  I needed snapshots of someone else's glossies.  ""A sumptuous film"" indeed.  I'm always drawn to eyes so full and silent they need never speak.  And I always wonder what they're saying.  And what they're seeing in me.  It's rare that I come across eyes like that, even in gelatin.  And so I couldn't sleep.  Instead, I went to the Olive Tree.  2AM and hanging in the branches.  Silent.  Street lamp clicking on again, off again.  Like you and I.  And I told myself, ""This is so rich here alone.  Why give it away?""  Just then a black cat crossed under.  It didn't see me crouching, lounging up high.  ""Tsss.""  It stopped, looked at me startled and then bound up the trunk, ears & cheeks rubbing my legs, nuzzling my hands.  We teased at each other a bit until he could tell I'd lost interest.  He returned to the earth below.  I was a little sad to see him go.  Then a 70s Bronco with huge tires and a lift pulled up at the edge of the park, engine roaring.  Two women - stumbling and loud - clamored out.  And like Maeve straddling the river, pulled down their pants between the Oleanders in a stream of laughter, profanity and piss.  I could hear the puddles gushing, see the legs squatting.  Me unnoticed, reclaiming the silence of deep space as they thundered off in deep bass."
312478,3879618,2004-07-09,"The strawberry skins were a bit leathery. Too long in the fridge, but still sweet enough for a smoothie. My most recent addiction: blended fruit. Singular delicacies deconstructed, with a dash of cinnamon. Always served best in a wine glass; the one I bought for 50 cents at Value Village. As the last puddle of liquid blossom streams from the bottom, I encourage it into my goblet, sliding  two fingers along the inside of the glass pitcher to the lip. Then lick my fingers. Everytime. Everytime I slide my fingertips along that last moment. And then rinse the pitcher clean, swishing the water to catch strawberry seeds. Those seeds love to linger. They don't know there will be a next time."
312479,3879618,2004-08-03,"Tomorrow is my first day off in fourteen days.  A kind of delirium overtakes me.  I could have spent hours picking out produce at Aqua Vita... spreading swiss chard, plump cherries, snow peas like fallen leaves curled together... After languid lingering and a ginger cookie, I decided to visit the Olive Tree.  My mind needed to wander freely in its branches, without the distraction of my refrigerator & things left undone & the objects of a particular life.  So I swung up her trunk & she graciously held me as pages turned & turned within me, like a book left out in the breeze.  And the full moon sprayed silver from behind wisps of cloud.  Scenes of our meeting drifted through my awareness: ""I came to request that you retract your accusation.""  After a long silence, I said, ""The alchemy that has transpired within me is beyond blame.  I have no wish to rewrite anything.""  And ultimately, faces in hands, foreheads pressed together & silent, the moon blessed our well wishing.  Down from the tree and back to the fruit.  Blood and cherry juice must be kindred spirits. The couch sucked me into a deluge of cherry flesh and slippery pits. One split open on my fingertip and I had to finish what I'd started, smearing cherryness all over my arms, watching the sugars glisten on my skin, juices dripping between fingers. A reminder of the possibilities hiding in each discreet moment."
315256,3974860,2004-07-27,"All are asleep, except for moi, and all tucked in their bed.  This is almost as good as having the entire house to myself when the hubby takes the girls out shopping with him.  I never realized how much I LOVE peace and quiet until it actually bestowed upon me.  I mean even if I just decide to ""veg"" out infront of the television the quiet is total (minus the gamma rays emitting from my television).         I have that feeling once again as I sit wanna-be-Indian-style in my chair typing these words in large Arial font.  Of course I am tired after seemingly chasing babies around all day while hubby was at work slaying the dragons (as he likes to call it).  But getting back to this feeling when I am able to have mindless thoughts or no thoughts.  I feel right now, my shoulders have released their knots and the constant flush feeling that I usually have about my forehead and cheeks is now replaced with a wind whispering cool feeling.  I wonder can it be that I too, sometimes mistaken for SUPER MOM, by my hubby and children, need separation and breaks from not only my children but my husband also?  LOL.  This is the life, free time to waste or not and do whatever I dayum well please!       On that note, I shall retire to bed and rest easy knowing that everything has already been taking care of and the only person I need to consider on my road trip to visit the Sand Man is ME.         . . . . . Happy dreams and all that good sh*t"
315257,3974860,2004-07-25,"My hubby scanned in this old picture of me because he just loves it so much.  Of course I don't really like it but I decided to put it on the page anyway.  Don't clown, I know the rose is a bit much.  LOL          I can't remember exactly how old I am in this pic, all I know is that I'm in my mid 20's.  See that's what children and husbands do to your mind - makes one very forgetful.              This is it for tonight, I'm tired and my back is aching (and of course the pill I've taken aren't working, figures).  So since this has been one of those ""calgon take me away kinda dayz"" I am going to bed and living everything as is.  Which means I'm not cleaning up the dinner dishes, picking up my 2 year olds toys (or her fathers for that matter) and I'm not even gonna arrange the bed for everyone. HA!              Good nite!  and sweet dreams.             p.s. why does my 2 year old daughter keep pulling off her diaper and running around the house?"
315258,3974860,2004-07-22,"Okay, this is your girl back in the dayz before I had children.  Of course I was with my hubby, even tho we weren't married yet.  This is his old apt (notice smelly boyfriend sneakers near my feet).  That's me just on my way to work after spending the night with my ""soon to be hubby.""  He sent me this picture saying ""ohhh Hunny, look what I found, now you can put this on your Blog site.""  (like I want to remember the slim me before 2 children.)  Even tho I AM still a hottie.  LOL           The children are asleep (touch wood) and hubby and I are in the office messing around on the computers.  Today I had and outing to the grocery store (yippee).  Most days that's about the only excitement  I get (that's outside the house).  My Hunny says that when he wins the lottery I'll be the socialite wifey that I am dreaming of becoming.  You know the type, that sits on numerous boards planning fundraisers for one foundation or another, whose children have traveled around the world before the age of 10, and whose husband is in the fortune 500 wealthiest men issue.  LOL.  I know, I am crazy.             Any ""who"" it's time for me to have a late nite snack of milk and cookies, YUMMY for my tummy!  Stay tuned for more ""back in the dayz"" pictures of none other than myself.             Peace and sooooouuuuuuul (memeber dat from Soul Train back in the dayz with Don Cornelius?)"
315259,3974860,2004-07-21,"It has been a long day.  Even tho I really have not done much outside of the house today I feel really tired.  The girls finally took there naps today around the same time, thus enabling me and the hubby to spend some time to ourselves.  That was very nice I must admit!  Tonite's entry is very short.  I've alot of errands to run tomorrow and don't want to go to bed too late.  And I don't want the girls to be cranky so I need to make sure they stay sleet thru the nite.  Until the time I find my way back here again . . . . . peace."
315260,3974860,2004-07-19,"Has come and gone and I find myself sitting at the computer once again and typing out more musings or rather rumblings from my head.  Hubby is attending to the girls and watching Elmo videos.  (anyone with children has a least one sesame street video including Elmo).  Of course we need all be in bed at this time but not in this household.  I think I've entered into the vampire realm where day is night and night is day, even the kiddies are affected.  LOL       Well I don't really have much too say except I feel I am in some bad need of some sleep, actually a vacation would be GREAT.  Mommy needs some girl time if you know what I mean.  *sigh*  Sooooo all that being said, I'll just sign off of this baby and try to turn in for the evening (I hope).  More than likely we'll all end up our bedroom chatting aimelessly, with one baby nursing, another baby dancing around to her baby tapes, and hubby and me gossiping (which is something we love to do).       *nite, nite*"
315261,3974860,2004-07-18,"I never knew married life with children could be so wonderful.  Each day I find that there are more and more things that I find out about myself and my hubby and our children that I did not know the day before.  Of course this revelation only comes thru constant communication and reaffirming our love and committment to one another and our children.           Today my hubby and I had a wonderful talk and we shared some deeper feelings and things to each other that we had not shared before.  Basically I'm saying that I  KNOW  I married the right person and that I truly have found my soulmate.          ""it's sooo gooo-uuoooood loving somebody, when somebody loves you back, and that's a fact"" - Teddy P.         - Over and out."
315262,3974860,2004-07-18,It's day 2 of my little online diary and so far a few other people have decided to join.  Some things are very catchy (like chicken pox).          My hubby and I are in our office - me fooling around on the computer and he actually working.  LOL.  The babies are asleep still so this is my time to just kinda goof off until they awake.         Well I think this about concludes my time here.  Gotta do some online shopping right quick while I still have a few hours before Mommy duties begin.  Who knows maybe me and hubby have a few moments to play house. LOL
315263,3974860,2004-07-17,"I have finished creating this thing.  With one baby (a 3 month old that I am nursing) and a 2 year old (who we are trying to potty train) it's not easy finding time for myself.  And as I type these lines now my hubby has the littlest baby waving legs and feet and arms in that I'm-trying-to-figure-out how these work kinda way.  And the oldest constantly pulling off her diaper because she wants to be ""free""  LOL       Ohh forgot to mention that my hubby is on his laptop trying to do work (yeah right).         Well I don't have much to say now cuz I'm tired with cramps in my neck not to mention sort of hungry.  (thanks Naze from Chi Town for turning me on to this site.)  Okay now lets see how many posts I'll have in here after about a month.         Holla! (I've always hated that yet I find myself saying it, go figure)"
315264,3974860,2004-08-08,"Later on in the morning is suppose to be our big day at the market. My hubsand and I have resigned ourselves to spending our big, huge, fun and exciting family days out at the local Farmers Market. Now who would have thought that something as simple as picking fresh fruit or vegetables to sampling goodies like peach almonds to kettle corn would be such a thrill. Well tell me say, IT IS. Since I am use to being in the house ALL DAY it seems, any little outing will do. I actually look foward to going grocery shopping. I mean, who looks foward to that. ME! I love grocery shopping. I love the way my oldest child likes to run around the store playing hide and seek and the way she tries to put any and EVERYTHING into the shopping cart just because she sees mommy doing it. It's a thrill. I guess maybe the point that I am making is that outings are fun when get to do them with my entire family. And please let's not forget about my youngest child, who is all wided eyed and looking EVERYWHERE when we all venture out into the public.          So tomorrow is our BIG DAY because I have been stuck in this house so long that I've seemingly forgotten what the outside world really consists of. My world has become consumed with daytime t.v. drama, Elmo and Judge Mathis. LOL. So my Hubby and I thought since we both like the Market why not make a day of it. And let me say, that Sundays on the water with the family is actully really great.           Okay, on that note, I'm off to see the wizard because if I don't get enought sleep now, by the time I awake in the morning the market will be gone. . . . . .           . . . . have a dreamy sleep and don't forget to say your prayers. - love always, The Cat"
315265,3974860,2004-08-01,"Sundays are always great. I remember a time when I was growning up there would be an occasion or two were I'd get breakfast in bed (with my favorite section of the newspaper along side my waffles). That's what this Sunday reminds me off. . . . those Sundays with breakfast in bed. Why do you ask? Because my house is CLEAN (I finally had a chance to clean it when hubby took the children out for a while) and my dinner is cooked. Which basically means that I don't have sh*t else to do and I can relax in my clean, pine sol and bleach smelling home, and not think about all the dayum dirt, dust, debris, and dirty clothes that are plied up. (and yes that is the story of my life, keeping my home clean - it's good Feug Shui). LOL          Well as I sit and type these lines, the children are down for their naps (yes both as the same time I can barely believe it myself) and the hubby and I are messing around on the computer (cuz we don't have a life). It's cold and gray outside (in Cali in the summer no less) and it feels like one of those days to light a log in the fireplace and put on one of those old dvd's that we've seen a million times."
317845,4247939,2004-08-16,"-=[INTRODUCTION]=-      Oh My GOD! Finally I created an account on this blogger.com..... You know what... it takes approximately 2 months to me to decide whether i'll open a blog or not..  i think i'm beginning to realize that it's really good to have an online blog like this... ^^ it's cool to see that someone actually read on your thoughts.....  anyway, since this is my first post, i'll write a little longer... *pleased don't be bored*       -=[O-Days]=-     For those who don't know what o-days is, hmmm.. let me think of a simpler word: OSPEK! hehe... now you know it guys.... 2 Things That make o-days different from OSPEK are:     1. It's only Happened @ Bina Nusantara University, Especially the International Undergraduate Program 2. There's no physical contact (Read: VIOLENCE!)  Ok Then.... the 3 o-days have already passed... My opinion about it: Terrific! I've never had any of these kind of feeling for those kind of activities.... I mean, the main purpose of the o-days are completely achieved (Once again: To ME ^^). You know The new Campus environment, the cute and pretty seniors (This one is really makes me anxious ^^), and of course the so-called campus life....  ok.... i don't want to be a suck-up guy or somethin, but i really like my seniors... how they put their efforts in the activity... and how nice are they actually (PS: In da reality man, not in the o-days). I'm really sad because o-days are over, cos i think i haven't put all my efforts on those days to get to know the seniors..... man... i hope in the outbound, i'll get a better chance to know them better... ^^      -=[New Days of Life]=-      New Community to me equals to a new life.... that means a lot.... new environment, new friends! and that also means ADAPTATION! hmmm.. if you really-really studied biology (not all students really-really studied it you know... ^^) those caps-locked words means your capability to adjust yourself with your surroundings, and the result will affect your ability so survive for your life..... this is important! although it's not biologically thingy, buat if you couldn't survive the social life.... well, just wait and see how miserable are you after it.... For New Campus life.... just Can't wait to feel it man..... come one.... campus mean that you're now almost adult, you have your own life to live in, your decission is in your hand now! haha.... (I feel So Powerfull!)     -=[Faith Conflict]=-     In the past few weeks, there's a faith conflict in my heart..... it's about my daily life... one thing that really stuck in my mind is the fact that i aint doin' any worships to God... you know the singing thing like the protestants do? (FYI: I'm Catholic).... i can't do that! i don't mean to insult protestants for their ways of worshipping, but deep inside my heart..... my consciousness says: ""It's Just Don't Fit Me!"".... man... i'm kinda confused now, whether GOD accept my thoughts or not. ok, not just that... i have several thoughts that i think are really in the contrary of church's principle..... like the gay stuff.... well, i dont know what will HE do to me... But Suddenly, one good stuff appeared in my ear (sorry, i forgot the source):     ""no matter what things you do, all you need to do is BELIEVE in HIM, and Put All of Your Life on HIS Hands... And From now on, you'll be saved""     wheeeewwwhhhhh... that stuff relieved me, now i'm ready to live my life like my usual life.....! AMEN!       -=[CLOSING]=-    Hey... sorry to finish this way too early..... it's already late now, and i'll have to attend the flag raising ceremony for the independence day celebration tomorrow..... talk to you later guys! ^^"
323065,3361005,2004-05-16,"I'm so confused today. I thought I was in a trusting relationship, but the past few days have really made me doubt those feelings. On Thursday, I came home after work and thought I'd check my home e-mails (I'm on the computer all day at work, so they don't get checked all that regularly). Much to my suprise and dismay, I read an email forwarded to me from some ""girl"" named Kim. It's a conversation between ""her"" and my boyfriend. It basically went something like this: (Kim) Hey, remember me? (Jeremy) No, refresh my memory. (K) We used to chat, I live in OP and remember talking to you. So what's your situation? i.e. Relationship status?(J) I'm in a relationship, but looking for something on the side if that's OK with you. (K) If you're in a relationship, why are you looking for something on the side? Does your girlfriend not do it for you? (J) It's not that, we've just been together for a while and now I'm looking to get into something new, if you know what I mean... And that's basically when the emails were forwarded to me by this Kim ""girl."" So of course, I freak out and my boyfriend ends up telling me what happend. I'm just pissed at this point, but we talk and I'm tired and have to work in the morning, so I just go to bed. On Friday, he forwards me an email that basically lets both of us know that the email wasn't from a girl named Kim, it's from some guy who apparently has feelings for me, but doesn't say anything to me, just tries to break my relationship up. Jeremy says that he only responded like that (the on the side, something new thing) to try and figure out who was behind the email. That he knew it couldn't have been from anyone he'd been chatting with before we got together because of the email address they used. Since asking who the person was wasn't getting him anywhere, this is the route he chose. He now admits that this was the wrong way to handle the situation, but is that only because I found out about it?   I was ready to break it off there, but the things he said made me think. He admitted to ""saying"" what he did and that it was wrong, he swears up and down that I'm the only one he wants to be with, professes his love and asks why, if I love him, won't I try to work things out? So he hasn't done anything wrong...yet. I just don't know what to think. Today I stopped by his place (I missed him, ok?) and we talked again, which of course led to making up. Now he's wondering if I'll still be going out of town with him to his sister's graduation and where we stand. I'm wondering if I should introduce him to my parents (as planned) when they get into town. In one sentence, he's saying we should take it slow and maybe only see each other a few nights a week, he's trying to get stuff done around his house, getting caught up on bills and so on and so forth. I agree with him, that is what he should be doing and driving across town to stay with me every night probably isn't the best decision in the grand scheme of things - especially with his gas guzzler and the price of gas working together to eat up as much money as possible. In the next sentence, he's talking about getting married and having kids.  I know that part of all this comes from the fact that he doesn't think he's good enough - he doesn't have $$ like my family does or whatever. In all honesty, I don't care about all that, but I understand and respect his desire to do so. I'll help as best I can, but I'm still so afraid that he's going to hurt me. My heart tells me he won't, but my head keeps reminding me of the situation this weekend, which makes me ask myself what part of me I should be listening to. I want to be with him, to make this work so badly, but can I trust him and who is this other guy that is trying to get in my heart and be my savior? Such a predicament. What they say is true, love IS blind!"
336091,4119694,2004-08-08,"Well, the buddy list actually has a scroll bar on it now, so Caravan people must be back :-P.  Ahh, band camp begins tomorrow.  I don't care what anyone says, Band Camp is way fun... especially if you're in the drumline.  We *know* how to party... especiall when Tyler is trying to act black, which is often, and always hilarious.  I'm gonna miss all the graduated seniors though... Allison, Matt, Jason, Bjorn,  you guys were great.  Thanks for the fun times (and the duct-tape-the-sophomore-to-a-tree night).  I finally wrote down my life story... it's not that long, only 11 pages, but I didn't go into detail so that I'd be able to share it w/ people... and my life's only been interesting since 9th grade anyway... yeah... :- It's now been 3 months since I began dating Mandy... and what a great 3 months those have been... Mandy, I love you, and I always will :-)  School starts in what, 2 weeks? And it's on a Wednesday too! WTF is up with that?  That means we might actually have to do something on that Friday... gross.  So yeah... it's Sunday.  Mandy's in Minn., Laura's in Colorado, my dad's in Baltimore, it's been just me and my mom *shudder* since Thursday.  Today has been especially boring... I watched Deep Blue Sea for the 3rd time in as many days.  Of course, the Red Sox never make it on TV around here, so I can't even watch those games. *sigh*  Oh well... I can smell food cooking downstairs... so I think I'm gonna go eat.  Nic  Mood: Bored, but happy. Music: Politik (Coldplay)"
336092,4119694,2004-08-05,"Well, I didn't post yesterday cause I was really busy, so this is a compelation of the last 2 days.  Went to the doc to check and see if I had lyme disease... thankfully I don't.  Then today, I had to go and check in for band and such at school... yuck... I have to go to school next week for band camp... yeah, laugh if you want, but apparently the band camp members are good at sex ;-) (yes, I finally saw American Pie and American Pie 2).  Well, school is starting on a Wed. this year... that blows.  But oh well... I still get to be a senior and get out 5 or 6 days early.  I'm getting way excited for school to start though.  I get to see all my friends again, I get to see Mandy every day (God, that will be wonderful), and it'll be my last year.  Plus, there's drumline season (and the football games, I guess...), band (which I don't care what people say, it's still fun), the choir trip to Flordia, etc. al.  Now if Mandy's ex would just stop being annoying... life would be wonderful :-)  Well that's about it... I'll leave you all with this.   I saw a sunflower growing on the freeway today.   Yes... a real, honest to goodness sunflower... growing right up out of the cracks of an overpass on Hwy 218.  I did a double take when I saw it... or at least, as much of a double take as I could while passing it at 70 mph.  It had grown a couple of feet out of the ground and was as big and bright and perfect as any sunflower could ever hope to be.  As I watched the brave little flower that was determined to hold it's own in the cruel world of concrete, metal, and exhaust that some wayward bird had no doubt left it in, I thought about the children's book ""Hind's Feet on High Places.""  There was a little red poppy in the story that grew from a crack of a mountainside.  As a seedling it had been left there by it's enemies to die... but because it chose to forgive them and love them, it found the strength and the will to survive and flourish in that barren and desolate home.   Sometimes I feel like that sunflower and that poppy.  I've been dropped into a harsh and cold world.  The environment I live in isn't the environment I was created for.  It's so hard for me to remember that the only way I can survive in this world is to let the love and forgiveness of Jesus Christ give me the strength and the will to survie and flourish in the alien world we call Earth.   I'm so thankful I passed that little sunflower today.  It's picture is etched in my mind as a constant reminder that I was not made for this world... but by God's grace I have been equipped to live in it.

336093,4119694,2004-08-03,"Well, today was pretty boring overall... my leg finally stopped oozing... it was pretty ""cute"" (as my mom put it) earlier today.  I got to talk with a good friend I made at the Waterloo Community Playhouse for a while today... that was pretty much the highlight of my day.  I'm in the process of finding a new NFL team I like... not only have the Vikings drafted a former WWE superstar in Brock Lesner, but now rumor has it they are moving to LA in 2007... not cool.  I know Mandy's vote on the matter (the Bears) and Chris' (the Chiefs) and Laura's parents (Packers... *vomit*)... but gimme your ideas :-)  That's about it for me... at least for today.

336094,4119694,2004-08-02,"Well, today was a pretty damn decent day.  I finally got me one of these lil' Blog thingies, so now I can actually write down what I do and what I'm thinking and such... and then others can read it too.  Yesterday, after church, I basically sat on my butt, it being the first day in 3 weeks without me having to concentrate on the play... then Mike and I went out for Chinese, ice cream, and then we rented Blue Collar Comedy Tour and watched it with his parents... which was humorus in itself, listening to Carla (Mike's mom) laughing harder at the whole thing than we were... wow :-P  Today - My mornings are always boring, filled with chores and stuff... you'll find this a common factor over most of my Blogs... Went and picked up Mandy at 1, came back to my house, and just hung out and talked for the first time in 2 weeks.  She's been gone at Girl Scout camp, and I've been busy with The Buddy Holly story... God, I miss that.  I miss all the people from the play, all the fun times we had, and just the experience that I had while I was there.  If you ever get a chance to act or perform in a play or a musical... jump on it.  It's a great time.  I got bored tonight, so I went and joined Mike's church league softball team, which was exciting.  Church league, and Mike still gets mowed down at the plate by some stupid base runner... the guy got ejected though... and I've forgotten to slide since I played baseball 3 years ago and cut my leg up nice.  I'm glad that my ""family"" is all back in one place again... but sadly, Laura is leaving us again on Wednesday... going on vacation... and then Mandy is leaving on Saturday to go on vacation... and so I'm  either hanging out with Mike, or going to band camp... *blink*.  I don't really wanna get into detail about how my leg hurts, so I'm just gonna go change the bandages on it.   Mood: Mellow Music: Jainy (Five for Fighting)"

But man did I have a good time. I even met famous people!!!! Actually I met one famous person and just saw a bunch more.  Kirk Cameron was there. He gave an amazing seminar that really made a lot of awesome points on evolution and such. His story about his life was just so amazing. He taught me a lot. Afterwards I got his autograph then waited around after that to get a picture taken with him. Me, Holly, Kelsey, and David were the ones in the picture. David kept going back and talking to Kirk about either A) his wife or B) Jerry Seinfield. It was so hilarious.  I made a lot of good friendships on this trip, too. I made pretty good friends with Sarah Mangipane. She's really cool. I also got a lot closer to Kelsey and David and Andrew and Angel (grrr, I know, but I couldn't help it) and Amanda and everyone else that went. It was fun. Except for on the last night when SOME PEOPLE wouldn't let me sleep.  The bus was actually a lot more fun. David Castle and David Zambron amused themselves by burping into a megaphone repetedly, David Zambron timed Shane Pritchett as he peed in a gas station restroom because he was sure he could pee for more than one minute (he only got to 45 seconds), and in the next room over Andrew Heberling was peeing (and just to let you know, the next room over was the girl's bathroom; he claims the boys line was too long, but all people who know Andrew probably know better than this).   Some of the other cool peeps I saw were Mercy Me, Stacie Orrico, Switchfoot, Pillar, Rachel Lampa, Lakita Garth (who was this really awesome speaker), Mike Williams (another really awesome speaker, but not as cool as Lakita) and, Of Course, Kirk Cameron. Every time I think about meeting him I feel like pinching myself.  I'm gonna get my pics back in a couple of days, so that'll be really awesome. Then I can actually prove to people that I met him and saw Stacie Orrico. I didn't take pics of the other people, but I did take an entire camera's worth of pictures on the bus. So that'll be good. And a bunch in my tent.   Well now that I've written about an entire novel, I think I'm gonna leave the rest up to your imagination and laugh in your face because I MET FAMOUS PEOPLE!!!!!!! And I also now have a better understanding with Christ which is what I was hoping to accomplish. That was the best part. All of you atheists out there, DONT BE!!!!! Life is so much better with God in it. There's this tremendous amount of comfort in your life and it makes you feel so much better about death because you know exactly where you're headed. Its great.   Peace out, Dwarlings..."
338013,3571998,2004-06-14,"Wow. I'm incredibly tired. Like really really really tired. But I have to stay up late tonight and get ready for Alive on Wednesday!!!!!! I'm packing so much crap I have to be sure it will all fit. It's for five days, tho, so if you think about it it's probably a good thing that I'm a little over-prepared.   Tomorrow is Holly's 16th birthday. She sucks; she's gonna get her license and crap really soon and leave me in the dust. Bitch. No, I'm just kidding. She's not. But I'm still mad at her. I got her present for her today; a dvd and cd case. And I got her this one notebook thing a long time ago with this gay pig thing named Olivia on it. Sorry, its this thing we have about Olivia. She's our bitch.  Well now I'm gonna go watch Best Week Ever because it is the AWESOMEST show ever. They make fun of crap on it and it's really good. They made fun of Harry Potter the other night; man, I was like laughing so hard I could hardly breathe. It's really mean, but dang is it funny.   Meet you over the river..."
338014,3571998,2004-06-09,"Well that's it. I'm no longer a freshman. I'm so glad about that, too! School sucks. At least it did. Now I no longer have Algebra. Even if I failed the exam, I still won't have to re-take it because they average out semesters and I gotta B last time. So that's good, anyway. I can't wait til I can actually have a chance to get an easy A or B in math. Before, just to get a B, I had to work really hard and I hate that. What can I saw, I'm a lazy butthole.  I'm really bored right now. I think I'm gonna watch ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" right now cuz I LOVE that movie and I feel like watching hot pirates run around. Especially Johnny Depp!!!! Whooo is he a babe!!! Him and Orlando Bloom swordfighting; it's like a woman's wet dream fantasy. Sorry if that's nasty, but if guys are allowed to think perverted things about women, then girls should be able to about guys. At least that's my point of view.  Well now I'm bored and kinda tired. The MTV Movie Awards are on tomorrow night and I'm really excited!!! Love those things.  Have a nice rest of your life.  (One week til Alive!!!!!!)"
338015,3571998,2004-06-08,"Wow, I cannot believe that the school year is really over. At least it will be tomorrow. I am really excited. I totally cannot wait until I really don't have to go back for a whole summer! It's gonna rock!  Only 8 more days until Alive!!!!! I super excited. I've never really been on anything with a church before and it'll be great to get a chance to become closer to God. I really need to go here to strengthen myself. Plus, my friend Holly got me really into this Christian band called Relient K which is a really awesome band. My fave song is ""Sadie Hawkins Dance"". IT's awesome!  If I clean my room out really good over the summer, my aunt's gonna let me get it painted. So man am I gonna kick some butt!!!! I'm gonna go for this like burgendy/pinkish kinda color I saw in this magazine. It's really cool and I think it'll look good in my room. Hopefully anyway.  WEll I gotta go; last day of school being tomorrow and all. Me and Hol are gonna go out to eat tomorrow after she finishes her 7th hr exam. I'm exempted, but math is tomorrow. I'm gonna pray really hard so that I can maybe get help from God on doing good on it! WISH ME LUCK!!!!  See you all on the flip side."
338016,3571998,2004-06-07,"Tomorrow I have to take my first exam of the week. I'm really not looking forward to it. It's kinda hard to look forward to it when it's an exam and those things aren't really things most people look forward to. Okay, now that I've confused everyone alive, lets move on.   I saw a friend with a blog, so I was like ""awesome! lets make one!"" so I did and thats why I'm doing this now. I'm sure no one will prolly ever read this, but that is a ok with me cuz it just kinda takes my mind off things.  On the 4th I went and saw Harry Potter with my pal Holly and her bf Andy and his ma and sister. It was a pretty good time. Then we went to eat at the Olive Garden. Andy's mom was really nice to pay for all of that. I was really respectful of that. We had fun.  Well now I'm officially tired. I don't have to go to school until 10:30 tomorrow cuz I'm exempt from two exams, but then that stinkin gay 4th hr exam had to pop up and now I have to go or else I prolly would have just skipped the whole dang day.  I guess I'm leaving. Adios."
338017,3571998,2004-07-17,"I came back from Mackinaw City early this morning (like, midnight) after seeing a play and eating out. It was actually pretty fun; something I wasn't really expecting. I went with Stephanie, Katie Reed, and Kelsey Moore. It was completely free; the play, lunch, dinner, and anything else we wanted if we had enough money. They gave us $25 and we could spend it as we pleased only it was suggested that we use it on, like, meals. I ended up buying lunch at Burger King, a buffet supper, and a Frappicino (I lllllloooooovvvvveeeeee those things!) The play was a little lame but it was still cute and I enjoyed it. Plus, IT WAS FREE (if you didn't already get the memo).   Today I didn't really do much of anything. I watched a little television, finished my book, and am now watching ""I Love the 90's"" and eating a cookie. Awwww, what a life. Guess what?????? ONLY TWELVE MORE DAYS TIL I GO TO CALIFORNIA!!!!!!!!!!! AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Hahahahahahahahah....I'm going, you're not!!!!! Hahahahahahahahahahaha!!!!   Okay so that was a little mean. Sorry to rub it in your faces...not. Hahahahahahahahaha.   Peace out, A-Town..."
338018,3571998,2004-07-12,"Aloha...  Yesterday night Katie Reed called and asked me to go swimming with her. So we went to Horst's house and swam with her cuz Justan. It was pretty fun. Even though I accidently kicked him in the face! But he was trying to flip me over while I was resting on my noodle. Bad move. Then he whacked me in the face with a different noodle. And then Katie jumped in the pool and right when she did the power went off. It was hilarious! She thought she caused it to go out!  Then I spent the night at Katie's house. We crashed pretty early but we weren't exactly sure what time because the power went out at her house too and screwed up the clocks. Even this morning we didn't know what time it was! Then we went back to Horst's. We waited with Justan, Tyler Coats, and Jared Miller until Justan's mom came back home so we could swim. Then he went to football camp and me and Katie swam for like 5 hrs! We were doing flips and crap and being complete losers but it was so fun! We'll prolly go again sometime this week.  I'm going to Cali in two weeks!!!! I'm bummed because I'm gonna miss the fair and Katie's barn theater play, but I'm gonna make her mom take pictures. And the fair always makes me sick anyway. I just wanted to see Holly's horse shows and stuff.  Holly's camping this week so I don't have anyone to confide in. Stupid loser. Oh well she'll be back soon. Me and Steph and maybe Katie are going on this free play thing on   Friday. It'll be fun.   Aloha..."
338019,3571998,2004-07-11,"Today I haven't really been doing much. I started another sort of blog thing at www.xanga.com but its not quite the same as this one. I'm sure I'll prolly update both of them just as regularly.   I noticed today that I have a tan! It's so cool that I actually tanned!!!! I never thought it was possible. But the downside to this is that I know have two different tan lines. I assume that these tanlines come from wearing different stylings of shirts while on the workcamp trip (i.e. I wore sleeveless one day, a cutoff the next, a wifebeater the next, etc.). I look kinda funny though.  I went swimming a little while ago, right after lunch actually so I guess it was actually a few hours ago. Wow does time fly by when you're on the internet. I think I'm gonna start e-mailing my pals from workcamp just so that they know I still remember them (even though I'm sure some of them aren't even home yet).   I'm gonna get going know and read or watch tv or write or draw or something along those BORING lines.   Adios amigos..."
338020,3571998,2004-07-10,"I just got back from group workcamps in Indianapolis, Indiana. It was actually a lot better than I thought it was gonna be. I made a lot of new friends from all over and I also grew closer to a lot of people from Sandusky. It was great.  We worked in groups to help needy people across the city. I was in a group of 6: Myself, Sophia (from Wisconsin), Megan (from Maryland), Cory (from Georgia), Dustin (from Ohio), and our group leader Jennifer, who was in her thirties, from Virginia. It was awesome to meet people from all over. I shared conversations with these Arkansas people who liked listener to my Northern accent. By the end of the week, tho, it was a little more Southern since I was around Southern people so often during the trip.   Some of the people from Sandusky that I made better friends with were Katie Reed, Chelsea Guildenzopf, Justan Horst, Jill Morningstar, Jordan Loding, and just other random people. We seemed to all get along pretty well. When we weren't working we were at this school just outside of Indianapolis and we had seminars and devotions and stuff like that. Free time was my favorite. Then on Wednesday we had a half day and went shopping. Some people went to the mall and others went to the movies, and blah, blah, blah. Shopping people: me, Ashley M, Jordan, Justan, Katie, Andie, Chelsea...Movies: Jill, Beth, Grant, Leslie...Other People who went to other places: Martha, Kathy, Mark.  When we went to the mall we all spent a lot of money...most of us spent all the money we had with us. Ashley Mezo spent about $100, Justan spent like $120 (on 4 things!), and the rest of us all spent about $20. Then we ate out at Stake n Shake. Thats my new fave restaraunt. The shakes are soooooooooooo good. I had a chocolate/vanilla shake. It was delectable.   Overall I had a great time. I also bonded with Leslie who was the girl's chaperone. She's pretty young (about 23 or 24) and we could all talk to her. There were some emotional nights and some really funny ones but altogether I just had a nice time.   Now I'm gonna watch television. Until then..."
338021,3571998,2004-08-08,"Hey there. Right now I'm in California. It's been pretty fun so far and I've been having a pretty good time even though right now I'm pretty pissed off. Just at ""certain people"" but I won't say who those are. Not yet anyway.  I've seen quite a bit. I'll put it in order for y'all...  Day One: We flew into L.A. from Detroit. Then we went to Anaheim, got a hotel, and went out to supper. After supper we came back to the hotel and watched the Disneyland fireworks because our room looked over all of Disneyland. It was a great view. Then I went back to my cousin Andrew's apartment and my aunt and uncle stayed in the hotel.  Day Two: Got up pretty early and went to Venice Beach. It was fun, I got to put my feet in the Pacific. Then we went to Santa Monica which was BEAUTIFUL. It's one of the most beautiful places I've ever been to. We rode on the roller coastar at Santa Monica pier and walked around. Downtown Santa Monica is soooooo nice. I wanna live there someday.  Day Three: BEST DAY EVER!!!!!!! We hiked in Griffith Park to the very top of a mountain where we had a clear view of the Hollywood sign. I actually had fun hiking! I made it up to the top first out of everyone in my group. Then we went to downtown Hollywood. When we were driving down Sunsent Blvd. I saw the club that Johnny Depp owns!!! ""The Viper Room"" is what its called. Then we went to the Kodak theater which is where they have the Oscars. I sat in Johnny Depp's seat!!!!! It was LOVELY!!!! Then we walked down the Walk of Fame and saw the stars with the famous people's names. Then we went to Mann's Chinese Theater which has all of the handprints outside of it. I put my hands in Judy Garland's, Marilyn Monroe's, and Shirley Temple's. Then I put my feet in Arnold Schwartzinager's, Bruce Willis's, Tom Hanks's, John Travolta's, and Robin Williams's. That was sooooo coool! I took some pics of Drew Barrymore's star on the walk of fame and I even saw two famous people!!!!!! I saw this one lady who was in the movie ""Rose Red"" at Mann's and then I saw Jojo!!!! She was in the car next to me on the way there.  On this day we also went on the Hollywood homes tour. But we did it ourselves instead of going on the bus cuz we got a Hollywood homes map. I'll list the houses that we saw:  Aaron Spelling The Playboy Mansion Babyface Sheryl Crow Wolfgang Puck Phil Collins Osbournes House!!! (my fave!!!)  Then later on we went to Brentwood which is just outside of Hollywood and went to this one place where we walked around and saw another famous person!!! This was someone I didn't know, but she's from the movie ""A Mighty Wind"" and she did look pretty familiar.  Day Four: Did some more Hollywood homes tours (actually a lot of these homes weren't in Hollywood, most were in Beverly Hills, some in West Hollywood, some in Westwood, and some in Bel Air). These are the people who's homes we saw this day:  Pauly Shore Leonardo DiCaprio Donatella Versace Tobey Maguire Michelle Lee Keanu Reeves Britney Spears/Brittany Murphy (it was Spears, but she sold it to Murphy) Charlize Theron Winona Ryder Halle Berry Larry Flynt Michael York Ben Stiller Bob Barker Billy Idol  Then we went to the Getty Center which is this big artsy museum thing with plants and photographs and crap like that. It was pretty boring but it had nice views of the entire city.  Day Five: We went to Huntington Beach which is a very cursed place for me!!!!! First I got taken under by this huge wave and almost died, then I got whacked in the back with a surf board and I couldn't breathe for a little bit, then I stepped on a jellyfish, then I cut my arm on a rock, then I got the worst sunburn of my entire life which hurt so bad I couldn't even sit down.  Lets just say I don't like Huntington Beach.  Day Six: We went to Laguna Beach which was pretty bad for me because I had to wear pants and a t-shirt so I wouldn't get more sunburnt. I wanted to go swimming so I wore my shirt in and almost died in the undertow. The waves here were HUGE, the biggest I've ever seen, but only right up at the shore so no one was surfing (thank God). It was okay.  Day Seven: We went to San Diego and went to the zoo. Mostly we just walked around and looked at a bunch of animals and I tried not to get more sunburned. It was pretty fun. I liked our hotel; we had two suites. It was big but I couldn't sleep all night cuz my sister snored.  Day Eight: We went to SeaWorld which was soo much fun. We rode on a roller coaster that got you all wet called Atlantis, then saw a dolphin show, then saw Shamu, then saw a sea lion show (the best) then we went to see a 3D movie which was the scariest thing ever for me cuz I hate those things. In between all that we saw otters, manates, polar bears, penguins and sharks too. It was really fun though.  Day Nine: We went to a Wild Animal Park in San Diego which was pretty cool. I got to feed and pet a giraffe and came pretty darn close to an elephant. It was nice but really hot so everyone was really tired. But I had a somewhat okay day. Then we came back to Anaheim and stayed at my cousin's apartment again and swam and watched ""Hellboy"" (a really weird movie) and ate Mexican food!!! YUMMY!!!!  Day Ten: That would be today in which we aren't doing anything. I'm on my cousin's computer and everyone is gone to Fries (a big computer store) except for me and my sister. We wanna go swimming later but I don't know if we will. My sunburn is better (it mostly turned to tan) but now on my back it is starting to peel. We leave to come home tomorrow. I'm soooooo ready. Even though California is fun, it's starting to get boring. I miss my friends and my cat and SCHOOL believe it or not. I cannot believe that, but I really do. I wanna see everyone again!!! And now I've actually got good stories to tell everyone!!! and a tan!!!!!  Well, I'm going to go soak myself in juices..."

339729,3840468,2004-08-06,"When I was a freshman in college we had a guy come and give a talk about his study of African shamans. Basically, his career entailed going from tribe to tribe in Africa in search of cures for incurable diseases like cancer. His viewpoint was that these shamans' medicine was as good as western medicine at curing things like infection, only they used different terminology. For example, one shaman described an infection as demonic possession. At the time, I was naÃ¯ve enough to believe almost all of what he said. Of course, he left out all the evidence that would have demonstrated that those shamans are no more knowledgeable about medicine than the Salem witch hunters during the Salem Witch Trials, who believed witchcraft was causing sickness and disease, among other evils. He wanted us to go away from his speech believing that the key to humanity's salvation lied in the tribal societies being destroyed by western/capitalist imperialism.  One of the things he left out was the shamans' cure for AIDS. Their cure is sex with a virgin, which results in the raping of very young children.  urlLink A commentary  I read today reminded me of this horrible truth.  Jimmy"
339730,3840468,2004-08-06,I've watched quite a few episodes of this series and I must admit to myself that this is not a TV show that will help Christians and or Jews to deepen their spiritual journey. This is just another liberal indoctrination show with the classic  gay kid who's been victimized by a religious Christian man  and  deeply religious Christian who's a homicidal killer  plots. This show is more likely to incite violence against Christians than deepen anyone's spiritual journey.  Jimmy
339731,3840468,2004-08-05,"The latest rumor is that Bush wants to get rid of the IRS and replace it with a value-added tax and or a sales tax. After thinking about it, I'm very confident that a national sales tax would be better for the American people. With fewer (or no?) taxes for corporations, products may be cheaper, a price reduction equal to the extra sales tax. People living in poverty wouldn't have to pay the taxes. The federal government wouldn't steal anybody's money from their paycheck, so poor people won't have to wait till the following year to see their money. This system would encourage saving money. Illegal immigrants and tourists would pay a portion of our taxes. That's right, people who believe America is scum yet somehow find themselves drawn here to spend their vacation will have to pay taxes. Plus, I love change and getting rid of tons of government bureaucracy is a huge change.  Jimmy"
339732,3840468,2004-08-03,"In the past few weeks, I've watched  urlLink the remake  and  urlLink the original . I'd like to point out some of the changes in the new version.  In the original version, all the young adults had been raised in the small-town home of Leatherface and they've come back to visit their hometown. In the newer version, the young adults come from big cities that are normal and get stranded in this small town full of seemingly genetically-inferior cannibals who act very strange.  In the new version, the young adults are coming back from a trip to Mexico to buy a piÃ±ata full of marijuana. None of this is true of the young adults in the original.  In the new version, two of them are boyfriend/girlfriend who have been living together for three years. In the original, there is no boyfriend/girlfriend and if I recall correctly, they're all related.  In the new version, the hitchhiker blows her head off in the young adults' van. In the old version, the hitchhiker (a male, who turns out to be Leatherface's brother) starts cutting himself. Then he cuts one of the young adults. So they kick him out.  In the original version, one of the young adults is a very immature guy in a wheelchair who's the brother of the owner of the van, as I recall.  The sherif, Leatherface's father, and the convenience store clerk in the new version are a split of one character in the old version, who is the gas station attendant and Leatherface's father in the old version. He's where all sickness of the sheriff came from.  The old version, unlike the new version, has very little cursing.  Jimmy"

Are you an American liberal or someone from Europe who thinks those fairy tales teach values that no longer need to be promoted in today's world? Well, RWN is coming to your rescue with our ""Politically Correct Fairy Tales!""  =====  Hansel and Gretel  Hansel and Gretel were lost in the woods when they came upon a house made of candy and cake. An old witch invited them in and then captured both of them intending to eat them. Gretel had a chance save both of them by pushing the old woman in an oven but she decided that it would be wrong not to respect the witch's cultural traditions. So Gretel and her brother allowed themselves to be cooked and eaten. The witch was so happy with the children's actions that she invited all of her witch friends to the area. Soon thereafter, they ate every child in a hundred mile radius. Soon the whole area was filled with nothing but child eating witches and all the witches were very happy!  The Moral of the Story: You must respect the culture of others, even at your own expense!  =====  Fisherman and the Fish  An old man finds a fish. The fish says ""Let me go, old man. I will reward you for my freedom by giving you anything you desire"". The old man at the behest of his wife makes wish after wish. Finally, the fish decides the old man and his wife are being too greedy and takes everything he gave them away. Then the man and his wife hire Johnny Cochran and sue the federal government for not having federal regulations in place to prevent wishing fish from unfairly taking away previously given magical spoils. The judge ruled in their favor and they were both given 500 million dollars worth of taxpayer funds with which they lived happily ever after.  The Moral of the Story: It's the federal government's responsibility to fix every bad thing that happens in the world.  =====  The Three Billy-Goats Gruff  The first and second billy goat gruffs were stopped from going across a bridge to get food by a troll. Then the biggest and baddest billy goat gruff showed up. He told the troll he was going to kick his @ss. That greatly upset the first and second of the billy goats gruff who accused the third billy goat gruff of ""hegemony"" and ""imperialism"" and said that negotiation was the way to go. So the third billy goat gruff went away. Unfortunately, the troll refused to negotiate and first two billy goats gruff starved to death.  The Moral of the Story:It's better to starve to death than to fight!  =====  The Three Little Pigs  There were once three little pigs. The first little pig built his house out of straw. But the big bad wolf easily knocked it down. Then he ran to the 2nd pig's house which was made out of sticks. But the wolf came there and knocked it down too. Then both pigs ran to the American pig's house which was made out brick. When the wolf came there, the American pig pulled out a gun and blew his stinking head off. Afterwards, both little pigs who lost their houses started building their houses out of straw again. When the American pig asked them why they accused the American of being an ""arrogant jerk"" and of ""acting unilaterally"". But they secretly knew the American would always save them, just like he did in WW1 and WW2 so they could afford not to be prepared.  The Moral of the Story: Even though Americans are helpful, they're real creeps!  =====  The Ants and the Grasshopper  All summer long the ants worked and prepared for the winter while the grasshopper went to Rage Against the Machine concerts and played Everquest. The grasshopper laughed and laughed at the ants for working so hard. Then winter came. The ants had plenty of food and shelter while the grasshopper had none. So the government took the ants tax money and built the grasshopper a house, gave him welfare cheese to eat, and paid for courses at the local university that the grasshopper didn't bother to go to. When the ants complained everyone agreed that they were greedy rich jerks for having more than the grasshopper.  The Moral of the Story: Taking money from people who work hard and giving it to the lazy is compassionate!"

347015,3496847,2004-06-04,"Three months ago I chipped a filling, while eating scrambled eggs, and had to have it replaced.  That was $260 - luckily, I have insurance.  I grind my teeth in my sleep, so the filling was weakened by that.  Now that same tooth is fractured and I need a crown.  That will be $950 and is not covered under my basic dental plan.  I did take out $500 worth of elective coverage, but I will need a nightguard ($230)to keep me from damaging the crown (or other teeth.)    I know I'm lucky to have a dental plan, but I will still be paying over $600 out of my own pocket (a.k.a. Visa, and that is going to hurt until I find a second job.  Back to my point - there is big money in dentistry.  If you like people being afraid of you and you aren't grossed out easily I say think of dentistry as a career."
347016,3496847,2004-06-03,"Well, I made it out for a run again this morning.    I'm using the  urlLink Cool Running  Couch to 5K program.  It's a great program.  Easy to follow - even with a cheap little stopwatch.  There are a few runs that are challenging, but you feel great once you're done.  I've made it to week 6 or 7 on a few occasions, but I tend to give up then.   But I will not give up this time!     Cool Running also has a great forum - great people to help keep you motivated.  Some are new runners and some a veterans.  A great place to visit if you're thinking of starting running.  I have a cat and while I was trying to type this entry she caught a fly in my bedroom.  I was a little grossed out when she tried to eat it on my bed.  I managed to shoo her off the bed, but then she was carrying the fly, in her mouth, around my apartment - and it was still buzzing.  I'm so glad she's an indoor cat.  I would hate to have her bring mice and birds in the house.    Well, I'm off to mentally prepare for a Friday at the office.  I like Friday as much as the next 9-to-5'er, but do we all have to go around on Fridays saying, ""Thank G*d it's Friday.""  The same goes for cursing Mondays."

It was a nice morning for a run.  I was surprised that I only saw one other person running.  There were a few early morning commuters waiting at streetcar stops and coffee shops.    Iâm trying to be healthier, and sleep is an important part of health.  I strive to go to sleep around 10pm and wake at 6am on days I want to run (10:30-6:30 on off days.)  Sometimes I find it hard to turn my brain off and I lie in bed thinking.  On top of that, I live on a busy street and my apartment is a few floors up, right on the street.  There are streetcars until the wee hours and garbage pick up twice a week around midnight.  I canât always hear the television if a streetcar goes by, so Iâve learned to watch it with the closed captioning on."

347021,3496847,2004-07-09,"I had trouble sleeping the other night.  Every half hour, from 10:30pm till after 1am, I would wake up because I was dreaming that the world was ending.  It was like the film ""Last Night"" where you know that the world is ending, and have known for sometime.  It was down to the final few hours, and you knew you were done for, but you had no idea how it would happen - disease, fire, pain, suffering??  I think that I would be one of the panicked people in an end-of-the-world situation.  Or I would become catatonic, living in a hole I dug in the backyard.

Blogging gets all of this useless crap that you're reading out of my head.  Crocheting lets me watch all the TV and movies I want without feeling lazy.  French is a language I've been learning on and off for years.  Aside from the 45mins a day they tried to teach us in school, I've done a year immersion in junior high (at an English school) and have taken evening classes.   One of my French co-workers is giving some instruction one lunch hour a week and I'm listening to audio lessons everyday and studying.  I'm also going to start watching some French TV."
347024,3496847,2004-07-03,"I have not had any luck this weekend.    Wednesday, just before 5, I got my finger caught in the safe at work.  It hurt - a lot.  I'm still surprised that I didn't cry and/or curse.  I have a pretty high tolerence for pain.  I'll make a show of it, curse and complain, but I can handle it pretty well.  I've broken bones and had things pierced and been okay.    So I got my finger jammed, freed it and ran to the kitchen to put it in cold water.  Under the nail had turned pruple immediately.  A co-worker ran and got me ice.  It wasn't broken so I went home, taking the ice pack on the subway with me.  I woke up Thursday and it hurt more.  It was swollen, the purple under the nail had expanded and turned black.  I spent Thursday in pain, and advil wasn't doing anything.  Friday my finger was even worse.  It throbbed.  I had to keep it elevated and if anything touched it I was near tears.  I went to the dentist for impressions of my crown.  The freezing wore off before he was done working.  More pain, just what I needed.  I then visited a friend, walked around TO to try and get my mind off my finger and picked up a few things at Wal-mart.  I walked from the Eaton Centre to Bay & Bloor and then around the U of T campus for a bit.  My mind never forgot about my finger and then I was tired and cranky.  I took a cab home from Wal-mart.  I tried to change my clothes once I was home and when I was taking off my shirt it touched my finger and it hurt - I was in tears and had to sit down.    So I went to the clinic.  I knew what had to be done to get rid of the pain, but it didn't sound like fun.  The doctor needed to drill a hole in my nail and let it bleed to relieve the pressure.  He held my hand down - I was lying down thank goodness, held my finger tight (pain) and started to dig a little whole with a needle (more pain).  He got through the nail (lots and lots of pain) and started to squeeze my finger to force the blood out (pain).  After about two squeezes I could feel the pressure letting up.  He spent about five minutes squeezing my finger.  He kept saying that I should of come in sooner, and that this is a terrible pain to endure for two days.  If the pressure comes back then I hould go to a clinic right away.  I promised I would - and I will if necessary, it hurt while he was doing it, but I'm much better today then I was yesterday.    My finger hurt all night from the squeezing, but I slept like a log and woke up in less pain.  Typing hurts, so that's it for now."
347665,3732995,2004-06-23,"So i just got a blog, not sure why but ohwell.  Today was good. Woke up VERY late as usual. My friend Tuesday that's staying here is really getting on my nerves. I'm sure I'm getting on hers as well. Joz called and wanted to go to the beach, but it was raining to we decided to just go to her house. I called Katey and her, Tuesday, and I all went to Joz's. There we met Bill and Tal. We all watched Donnie Darko. Yes I'm getting sick of that movie. I know it's hard to believe because it's like the best movie, but this was like my 8th time watching it. Ohwell, it was good the first three times. So then we all went to Taco Bell and ate. Then Tuesday and I went to Kateys house while Tal Joz and Bill went to the beach. We were just being silly at her house and took pictures pretending to play basketball.. yeah wtf? I don't know.. I downloaded that ""sail away sail away"" song by Enya and we were blasting that for a while. Ha Joz saw our away message last night about Van Morrison and she had downloaded ""Brown- eyed Girl"" Ha, that was funny. Last night on AIM, Kevin saw my crazy Van Morrison away message too and said he liked that song too. I can't wait to see him. It's so wierd like I don't like him that way at all but he likes me, and like noone likes me. Kevin's adorable too, so I don't know whats wrong with me. I'm too busy liking wierd people like Mike Singer and Milt. Hm. I really should move on with my life.  But anyways then Bill picked us all up and we went to Jocylyns Youth group thing. I could tell Katey and Tuesday were really bored. They kept looking at me lik ""ok when can we leave"". Yeah I guess it was pretty boring. Rhonda was there and she hates me I think so that was wierd. I met Jocylyns friend Melody, and shes really nice. I was lisstening to the sermon and the songs, but I didn't really feel God's presence. I really wanna be closer to God. Like I think I'm already pretty close. First of all I believe in him and I have faith in him. I pray every night for my family, friends, and for myself. But I guess theres more I could do. I don't know. So many of my friends don't even believe in God, and those who don't really like follow him you know? Like Natalie is the only one. Liek I don't know I think I'm just more private about my faith. I don't really like going to church that much because worshipping with other people just feels wierd to me. I hope that doesn't make me a bad person.. I don't know.  Another thing is I really care too much what people think. Most people hate me or whatever so that makes things worse. I know I'm hard to get along with sometimes, but a lot of people that don't even know me judge me. That's really not fair. Like this year has been the worst year of my life. People have just betrayed me in so many ways, and I just don't depend on anyone anymore. last night Mike told me that everyone at Allderdice thinks I'm a joke. I don't think that's true. People liek him just liek to bring others down, and that's just not cool. I need to stop living in the past though. I need to figure out who I am and just not care what others think. I need to find me and be comfortable as me. I just know I can't live another year like I lived this year. Ohwell. I think we're about to go pick up my Grandma at the airport. I hear becky comming up the stairs..."

353346,3984432,2004-07-21,"Welcome to the online magazine ""ON TOP of the world"", which stands for ""Opinionated News for Ticked Off People of the World."" (If you're wondering why the title is so longwinded, you obviously don't know me very well... give it time.) Our goal is to make this a place where you can come to listen to people sit on their asses and complain about the issues that you sit on YOUR ass and complain about! Because I cannot lean any further right, politically speaking, without falling over and hurting myself, I've decided to get together with my liberal friend, Matt Collette, to create this publication. Only Fox News - one of the most middle-of-the-road TV stations ever secretly controlled by Ronald Reagon - has been able to provide such fairness and balance up to this point in time.   Some of you may be wondering why I'm writing an introduction to this website when my colleage has already done so. The reason is that his introduction sucks. First of all, he was very informal. Now don't get me wrong - I'm all for an informal publication. But in an editorial there is a certain professionalist feel that needs to be given. Second of all, he keeps calling this a ""blog"". I know that that is the technical name for this type of website, but we are merely using this form to create an online magazine.   I told him these things, and told him that he should fix it, though really I was thinking that I should have been the one to write it, anyway - I am, after all, the Editor in Chief. He suggested that I write my own if I wish, as it would showcase our differences. Well, I guess in that we have succeeded, for you can already see that he is wrong and I am right. That, I imagine, will be the general tone of this publication.   For those of you who don't know me well, I am infamous for these online writings for two reasons: one, I do not update them frequently; and two (and this is the biggie), I have been known to offend people. The last time I attempted something like this, I ended up having to fend off an entire army of skateboarders. If you want a lesson in the benefits of joining a union, go ask the skateboarders - trust me, those mothers can band together like Baptists at a Catholic boarding school.   Well, I suppose that I should wrap this up shortly. Please - check back often for updates. We plan on discussing a hot issue from two points of view - Matt's and my own - on at least a weekly basis, and will be adding personal updates frequently, too. We may even pull in some guest writers, if we don't scare everyone away too fast. Most importantly to note is that we have no idea what direction we're going with this, so not only do we welcome your input, but we probably will need it if we want to save ourselves from looking like asses.   And remember - if there's an issue that needs to be discussed, we'll be ""ON TOP"" of it. And hopefully without too many lame, cliche jokes and taglines.

353348,3984432,2004-08-15,"Here are some common reasons that people use when describing why they think that John Kerry should be president... followed by facts that prove these ""reasons"" to be nothing but pure fiction.  1 - DONT vote for Kerry because ""he would not have dragged us into war."" According to a recent statement from Kerry, even if he had known that Sadam did not have weapons of mass destruction, he still would have brought us to war JUST LIKE BUSH DID - in fact, Kerry states that he would have made all the choices that Bush made, including acting without UN sanction, but that he just would have made different wartime choices in the actual battles.  2 - DONT vote for Kerry because ""he will work for the average American, not just the rich."" Okay, here's a newsflash:  Kerry is rich, his biggest supporters are rich, and - just like every other politician in US history (including, I'll admit, Bush) - he's never going to do ANYTHING without at least a little consideration for those paying the bills.  Yes, Bush gave tax cuts to the rich, and gave less to ""middle America.""  But consider these two facts:  first of all, the rich (obviously) have a lot more money, so giving every million- and billionaire $100,000, for example, is the same percentage as giving a guy who makes $30,000 a year a grand back; second, Bush gave SOME money to the middle class, and tried to give even MORE, but guess who voted against it?  That's right, John Kerry.  Kerry voted AGAINST tax cuts for the middle class, even though now he's yelling at Bush for not doing it.  Plus, before you think that Kerry is really going to be a man ""for the masses"", remember that 99% of the entertainment industry (think Michael Moore, DMB, Michelle Branch, and the omni-present Susan Surandon/Tim Robbins duo) has come out to support John Kerry - and these are the richest 1% of the American people!  You can bet your ass that if Kerry really was going to play favorites any less to the wealthy than Bush would, America's richest wouldn't be showing Kerry their support.  Think about it.  3 - DONT vote for Kerry because ""our economy is bad and he needs to fix it."" America has just gone through the biggest job growth in US history.  The stock market is starting to go up.  Sure, the economy wasn't the best for a little while, but then again we had just gone through September 11th - an event that cost us $100 Billion, not including the wars in Afganistan or Iraq (and let's not forget that one of the reasons why the economy seemed so good in Clinton's time was that he SEVERLY cut defense spending - something that seemed to do us a damn lot of good in Fall of 2001, didn't it?)  Some people say that the economy is bad, and we need Kerry to fix it, but this simply isn't true.  There's nothing wrong with the economy.  Jobs are being created at historic levels, companies are all on rebounds, AND while oil prices are rising, the growth is considerably less, when taking into account inflation, than it has been many times over the past 35 years.  Here's another thing to ponder:  if Bush was not the way to fix the economy, why would every economic group in the US, including Wall Street, be backing him and his policies?  4 - DONT vote for Kerry because ""he was a great soldier and knows about war."" According to a new book, Unfit To Lead, in which more than 240 men who served in Viet Nam on the same watercraft as did John Kerry (including many in his unit) contributed, Kerry has lied time and time again about his war record, including where he served and what he did.  For example, he said that on Christmas day he was in a location that it would have been impossible to get to, and when pointed out this fact, Kerry said something along the lines of ""oh, well maybe I didn't go there.""  Sure, there are groups like Veterans for Kerry that support him, but these men did not serve with Kerry and many, including one of there top spokesman, didn't do anything war-related even close to what Kerry did, and so is about as useful a source as I am describing college-level physics.  Furthermore, an overwelming majority of our nation's veterans support Bush, and that certainly says something.  5 - DONT vote for Kerry because ""he believes in what I believe in."" To be honest, Kerry might believe in exactly what you believe in; the problem is that no one really knows for sure!  Kerry has been flip-flopping back and forth on almost every issue over the past few years, particularly since the campaign started.  Kerry says that he doesn't believe in abortion, but according to his voting record he has voted FOR abortion - in all sense of the word, mind you, meaning that he has voted for ALL abortions (including, therefore, late-pregnancy ones) - on dozens and dozens of occasions.  He says that he doesn't believe in gay marriage, yet he has voted FOR gay marriage many times and has supported Massachussetts's plan to make gay marriage legal.  So no matter where you stand on these or any issues, it's rather hard to tell if John Kerry is on your side or not!  Those are some reasons NOT to use in deciding to vote for John Kerry.  If you still have reason to do so, then by all means, give him your support.  But you'd best not vote for him for those reasons because - and probably many others - because they are not truths but are merely lies from the Kerry camp trying to steal away your votes."
353349,3984432,2004-08-06,"I apoligize that my post is going to be brief, but it is based on the fact the  I really couldn't agree with Corey much more . Though Americans are divided, they are divided for the  same reason ; they want America to be the best it can be but differ in their opinions as to how do do it. This delimma has been the same throughout history - parties have also bickered and attacked ideas and politicians.  Though the issues we argue over are different today than they were in the late 1770's, we argue for the same reason. Each side wants to make American the best it can be, but each side sees a different route that America must take. Imagine this in terms of two different family vacations:"
353350,3984432,2004-08-05,"In the months following the terrorist attacks of September 11th, 2001, the phrase ""united we stand"" became a popular saying, almost to the point of becoming a cliche.  At the time, I took it to be a war call, a method of intimidation to America's enemies that we were not a people who would allow such an attack to go unpunished.  It was an attack plan, a call to arms, and one that resulted in one of the most unifying efforts in American history.  During this period, there was a lesser-known clause which I had also heard from time to time: ""divided we fall.""  Swept up in the wave of patriatism and eagerness to bring those who had attacked us to justice, I paid this phrase little heed.  Indeed, for a short time it seemed that most Americans couldn't even remember a time when we were not united under one cause.  Since that ""fatefull day"", as it has so often been called, almost three years have gone by, and much has changed in our country.  Much of what has occured during that time have become the major issues in the upcoming election; the state of the economy, the reforms made to national security, and the wartime decisions and actions made all seem to be key factors in who Americans will be giving their votes to in November.  Of  course, as a young, politically-minded American, I share some concern in these election-related areas, and have certianly considered them over the past few months.  But to me, a much bigger and more pressing issue has emerged as things have heated up in the States, and that is the unity of our people.  Back when the founding fathers of our nation met to fight for and shape a new country, they were not nearly as agreeable and one-minded as many textbook interpretations have led us to sometimes believe.  Just like we do today, in the twenty-first century, the revolutionaries of the 1700s had their share of controversies and disagreements.  Whether arguing over how many delegates each state should get in the legislature, where to locate the nation's capitol, or whether the fedralists or the antifedralists had correct notions in regards to state-versus-federal power, the brave men and women who created America were certianly in near constant disagreement.  To some modern people, it appears to be miraculous that our country was created at all.  How, with all of this disagreement, had their been enough strength to create what quickly became to most powerful nation on earth?  The answer, I believe, is that for all of their differences, our founders were united in a single cause: to create and protect a free and just country.  At the end of the day, when the debate hall doors were swung shut and the newly-dubbed Americans made their way back to their homes, they were all united, despite their differences.  And when it was time to fight and to protect that which they loved, our brave forefathers thought not of what they disagreed on but rather on what brought them together.  This amazing bond between every man and woman in America remained strong.  Many times, it waivered slightly, and once - in the Civil War, the darkest of times in history - the forces that drove America apart did, for a brief period, outweigh the bonds pulling it together.  But now I ask you: where is this unity that has so long served and empowered our people?  What has happened to the bonds that have for so long kept us together?  Over the years, America has learned to express itself, to speak out against injustice, and to make loud and unyeilding calls for reform; but despite all that we have learned, we have forgotten to be united, and to stand together as one great people.  I know that this unity is waivering when the entire ""Current Events"" section of the local bookstore is filled with publications called the President of the United States an idiot or a liar, or when the leaders of our nation are referred to as ""stupid white men""; likewise, I can feel it dying when I hear the Democratic National Convention being called the ""meeting of our enemy"", and when political ads suggest that anti-war means anti-patriotic.  The problem, I believe, has developed because many Americans have forgotten two things: first of all, that one can disagree with another while still showing that person respect; and second, that despite our differences, Americans have always and do now share one goal, and that is to make our nation and world the safest, most productive, and most free that it can be.  Too soon have we forgotten that we can express our differences without overshadowing our similarities; too soon have we forgotten that we can hate a man's idea but still love the man; and too soon have we forgotten that the ties that bind us far outnumber and overpower those that would tear us apart.  So now when I say ""united we stand"", it is more than an empty slogan, more than a call to arms in a desperate time; it is a powerful and all-important reminder that if we hope to achieve anything, we must work towards it together - not as enemies or competitors in a political arena, but rather as sons and daughters of America, and fighters for freedom and justice.  Of course, we will sometimes disagree, and we will surely never be in complete agreement; but if hatefulness, negativity, and mudslinging have any place, it is not in the America that I know and love.  Above all else, we must not become a people divided.  So when asked what you are, do not answer that you are a Democrat or a Republican, a member of the Reform Party or a member of the Green; but rather, answer that you are an American, for only through unity and brotherhood can our individual voices be heard and our beloved freedom be proected."
354827,3949634,2004-07-22,"One cry, and I stumble from bed, cow-heavy and floral In my Victorian night-gown.  -   ""Morning Song""  -  Sylvia Plath    I'm a nursing momma.  My daughter is almost 2 1/2 years old, and she still nurses.  If you are hearing this and are offended, well I'm sorry you haven't the depth of understanding of what this means.  So let me clarify, ""Campbell"" (name changed to protect the innocent), is not holding on to my nipple for dear life and nourishment.  I think most people suspect, when they hear me say that she nurses, that Campbell, is soley nourished through mothers milk (and unhealthily dependent).         Nursing is much more like a snack between meals at this age.  But even this has faded.  Its more for an emotional bond with mommy, and a sleep aid at this point.  She ""nurses"" in the day for mommy time, and nurses at night for a pacifier.  Most people would never have a clue of this, unless I told them or felt they were ""safe"" enough to nurse Campbell in front of.  Occasionally there is the public milkdown...er, Was that a Freudian slip or what?... MeltDowns (Sorry folks, it came out as I was typing)....Where Campbell will be grabbing at my breast for dear life like someone on fire looking for water.  ""I want some milky"" she will say.  Sometimes screaming or crying for this mommy time, in places where I don't feel comfortable.  Sometimes when I'm holding her or carrying her, she will try to slip her hand down my shirt and literally grab my breast and try to pull it up for nursing.  This is very comical.  And sometimes, she will just place her hand on my breast, down my shirt for comfort.            What is so funny is that many women in my family and some friends, have been grabbed for some ""Milky.""  I simply had to explain to Campbell, that when they are mommies they will have milk, too.  She laughs and giggles about it, but she doesn't quite understand yet.  She will still try ever so often to latch on to her Aunt Allie during bath time.  Aunt Allie is my twin.          To explain night nursing, that's another thing.  Campbell is so dependent on nursing to sleep, that ever since she was born, I have not had one wink over three hours continuously.  Well, except for recently, after her first waking she will sleep a longer period of time.  However, she wakes up an hour 1/2 to 2 1/2 hours to have ""milky"" after first putting her down, then she might sleep for 3 hours tops, followed by the hour 1/2 to 2 hours before she wakes up, where she will remain latched on till waking.  Let me explain why, whenever she awakens, its during a light awakening.  Babies and Tots spend more time in light sleep because their brains are developing, if they were to spend just as much time in deep sleep as adults their growth would be minimal compared to their growth in the first three years.  Along with brain development, much time for babes and tots is spent in light sleep soley for the purpose of survival.  Its amazing to think that the will to survive is embedded so deep within our cells, that its not something we even need to think about.  Truly amazing, being all that babies have when they are fist born are uncontrolled movement and unintelligible vocals.  Their sheer will to survive is beyond any concept that they could ever fathom.         When Campbell was born, she cried much and barely slept.  She was very alert and seemed to be taking so much in that in overwhelmed her.  Many times though, I stressed over the fact that something could be wrong, in the sense that I was projecting that she was never happy.  Or, that I ruined her in womb.  Instead of seeing this as a spirited child, which she truly is and happy at that, I thought there was nothing I could do.  So when it was time for sleep, I nursed her.  This seemed the only thing I could do to get her to sleep.  This was good and bad.  Good, because we both could get some sleep, but bad because it only lasted a very short hour - hour 1/2 before I would have to nurse her back to sleep and usually stay in the same position with my breast in her mouth so that she would stay asleep.  Now, time has passed by and the sleeping stretches are longer, but I'm still not getting enough sleep to be completely rested.  I've trained my baby to depend on my breast for sleep. However, this in no way has made her dependent on me for much else.  She is securely attached, enough to be without me and be with other people.  She is very independent.  People think nursing conceives a needy child.   Quite the opposite is true, the more you let go and give in to their needing you, the sooner they will always trust you to be there, the sooner they will want the hell to get away from you  :)  Seriously, nothing else would do for her - No pacie, no animal, blanket, or anything, just me.  I'm her lovey.          I also realize that time presents itself for everything when all parties are willing to concede.  This is the time.  I know I can now set a boundary, so that I may get more sleep, and so will she, but still be there for her to comfort, hug, kiss, sing, etc (we co-sleep).  I know now that as long as I am ""there"" for her, allowing her to have her feelings with me, she is safe, cared for, and loved.  She will understand her importance is equal to mine, that my sanity and good mothering is enhanced with sleep.  She is the Center of the Universe, but not the only one in it.   I start tonight.  We have talked for a week or so about it, how when we first laydown to go nite nite that she may have ""milky,"" but when she wakes up anytime after in the night, we will not have it.  But when she sees daylight, she may have milky again.  Cold Turkey is not a good idea.  I've been nursing her way to long to be cruel and stop all at once, plus I want to avoid Mastistitis (sp).  That's breast engorgement.  Very painful.  So each day I will do this until she eventually sleeps althroughout the night, without my help.  Then that should create a domino effect for nursing overall.  So Wish me best wishes!  Here goes for a new chapter for us both.  P.s.  I will be adding links soon under the pseudo and appropriately titled ""Playgroups"" - these will be the blogs that inspire me, and interest me, the place where this mommy can go to have a sense of community.     P.s.s  More blogs to come on:  TWINS, PUNK ROCK MOMMIES, SIX DEGREES OF SEPARATION, Exotic Fever,  Campbell stories and lessons I learned from her, and more, something about death, (its something that you think about often once you have children, and let me rephrase, the fear of...When you are young).  I will also be listing music that have been playing around here in this house, as well as shot outs and dedications!"
354828,3949634,2004-07-19,"Without warning, it's the Washington City Paper's superficially revealing inquiry into the musical mind.  Let there be war! MOTOR CYCLE WARS! Yes, the fierce quartet of Jason Hutto (guitar), Jimmy Askew (bass), Clark Sabine (vocals), and Bonnie Schlegel (drums) has descended upon our fair town, hurling fusillades of dangerously high decibels in every direction, luring our youth into wild paroxysms of hedonistic abandon, and, finally, declaring victory. Many of these proud warriors will be familiar to regular readers of the Quiz, makers of the scene, and scrutinizers of the City Paper's masthead. And like other seasoned veterans of musical mayhem, they will, they will rock us. So why fight it? In fact, why not sign on for the cause? This Monday, Jan. 22, Motor Cycle Wars will slay the Dead Teenagers at Galaxy Hut. The show is free. The cost in human lives is incalculable.      urlLink    The Madness  urlLink     What equipment do you use and what's your favorite smoke?   CLARK: I don't smoke anymore and I sing, so I just have a little foam thing that goes on the mic so I don't hurt myself.    urlLink    Clark  urlLink      JIMMY: I play a cheap-ass bass through a Peavey amp and head. I don't know the specs because I'm not a nerd. And my favorite smoke is second-hand smoke on a cute girl's breath.    BO: Now I wouldn't call it my favorite, but I have been chemically dependent (also ignoring the power of will to stop) on cigarettes for about six years, maybe seven, and the majority of the time it's been the Cowboy Killers (Marlboro Reds). It used to be Camels, Newports, and some other brand...and not necessarily in that order.    HUTTO: My fingers smoke when I play my D.C.-issue Gibson SG. I really shred, you see.     What kind of drums do you play and what pets do you own?   CLARK: I have four fish I saved from an above-ground pool at a 9:30 Club staff party last year.    JIMMY: I have The Sims.    BO: I use the drums, that were formerly Jason's...I'm not sure what kind they are. It's red. And the kick pedal almost matches, because my toe bled all over it when I wasn't wearing any shoes a few days ago. I will take credit for Clark's fish, because I invited him. Otherwise, he'd be short four friends...Winken, Blinken, Nod, and Stanley. (Names have been changed to protect the little bastards.) Just joking...they are really cute and they can tell the best stories.     urlLink    Bo  urlLink     HUTTO: I play a mean set of drums, and sometimes when pouring a nice bowl of Honeycomb, I notice Mr. Wacky-wing, the stub-winged crow, hanging out in our backyard. My roommate Kim feeds him bagels, and to show his appreciation, he brings us jewels he steals from McLean. Cool damn bird.     What's your favorite D.C. hangout and your favorite automobile?    CLARK: Galaxy Hut is my watering hole, and I don't really like cars that much...    JIMMY: The Hut. Hands down. Sorry everybody else.    BO: I think it would have to be the Galaxy Hut, but I'm footbound now, so I'd probably have to say our house...    HUTTO: Yes, the Galaxy Hut. Clark's mom pays Jimmy and I a lot of money to be friends with Clark. The Hut is a safe place to let him run free. He loves it. Also, no truck can get me and my friends to the Galaxy Hut in more style than my '85 Nissan pickup with king cab and camper shell. ""My Nissan truck can really go the miles.""     What's the worst place you've crashed and the worst haircut?    CLARK: I went to a place called ""Oh's"" hairstyling in Shirlington this past year and got a feathered, mouse-filled, 1980s, six-inch pompadour. I think I looked pretty HOT, actually...   JIMMY: Once I got a buzz-cut when I was 8. This was way before they were cool and my shit got mocked. I slept in my garage once because I lost my keys.   CLARK: Hey, I slept in a garage once, too...    BO: I don't get bad haircuts, just bad people. Once, when I was 14 or 15, I snuck out of my house, and I couldn't sneak back in because I think someone was still up. So I slept outside on a lawn chair underneath the deck in my parents back yard...except there was no crashing about it. It really sucked and eventually I got in somehow...I don't even remember.    HUTTO: I had a crew-cut in 10th grade that turned into a flat-top and, eventually, a full-blown mullet by 11th grade. I was really into the ""wet look."" My grandma wasn't really into my gelled hair or my acid-washed jacket and pants that I wore every day. She said they were ugly. The old don't know.   urlLink    Jason  urlLink      Worst roommate and best audience?    CLARK: I lived with this guy in Orlando, Fla., who used to change the oil in his motorcycle in our living room, hang bed sheets with bad words written all over them on the walls, and thought he was Eddie Vedder.    Best audience, in this band, was at our Galaxy Hut show. Everyone got involved and that was really fun.   JIMMY: I live alone. Our best crowd was the one at Black Cat because there were so many people who had never seen us and who were actually shocked, as opposed to the kids who are used to us by now. It was fun to watch them go, ""Whoa! This shit is nuts!""    BO: Best audience, I'd have to say, was at Catholic U. Or that's where I had the most fun playing, and then the Black Cat show. So it looks as though out of the four or five shows we've played, all of them have been our best audience.    HUTTO: I hate brown crickets. I lived in this dump where the bathroom was also the shower. There was a shower head coming out of the wall by the door and a drain in the floor under the sink. When I'd shower, I'd notice all these goddamn spiky brown crickets circling around me. staring at me. Them goddamn bug-eyes. Definitely the best audience.     Explain your band name and define your sound.    CLARK: I still don't know what our band name means. Ask Jimmy, he came up with it. Our sound is really low-key and not really thought out. We start to play, find a flavor, and just go.   JIMMY: Dude, the name was all Hutto. I was pushing for Chickenhawks UK. Our sound is, umm, Swamp-Rock.    CLARK: Oh, I thought it was you...    BO: Chickenhawks UK? Thank God the name was all Hutto. Jimmy, do we even play in the same band?    HUTTO: In Arkansas, the highlight of many a youngster's year is when the monster trucks come to Barton Coliseum in Little Rock. Halftime entertainment during this exhaust spectacular is Motorcycle Wars! This is when there's no less than 70 motorcycles jumping and flying all over the goddamn place. It'll set you free.     What clothes do you like to wear on stage and what do you eat on the road?   CLARK: I'm not answering, my mom could be reading this...   JIMMY: Layers, so that I can shed them as I get warmer. I eat fried food on the road. Actually, I eat fried food everywhere.    BO: Christmas Lights. Nothing else. I haven't done that yet, but I think I will get Clark or Jimmy to do that, and I'll take the Hunters (tiger-striped underwear that Clark favors live)...don't worry, Clark, I won't tell your mom about you and your (Aussie accent) ""This is the world's most deadliest snake and I'm going to stick my head in its mouth"" drawers.    HUTTO: My fashion theme as a rock star is a garage worker who happens to play guitar. Just like Elvis did in so many excellent movies. I feel our blue-collar crowd can really relate to that. My mom taught me that carrots are an excellent snackable road food that's fun and nutritious.     What are your influences and worst equipment experience?   CLARK: I smacked myself square in the forehead with the microphone once at a show. I had mic-grill marks for three days...    JIMMY: I tore my right hand open on my bass and bled through the whole show. It was actually kinda cool. Oh, once I blew our old head during our first song and had to play our whole set through a practice amp.    urlLink    Jimmy  urlLink      BO: I wouldn't exactly call it worst equipment experience, but usually every show, I develop a bruise on my thigh the size of a football from my snare hand beating down on it. Its hard to walk after that.    HUTTO: All instrument cords are the root of evil. They love to tangle and mate and get all spaghettilike around my neck and arms and legs. Geez. Then I get all mad and the room gets hot, 'cause I'm tripping and knocking everything over.   Tony Robbins is a powerful influence. He is my financial advisor and golf buddy.     What's your favorite tour memory and worst band squabble?   CLARK: We tour in May(?). Jimmy and Bonnie got into it once before a show. It was really funny. We generally never fight.   JIMMY: I love Bonnie and she loves me.    BO: It was me against the three of them. I wanted to set my drums on the ground stage instead of the riser (it's scary up there without my crew). Well, it wasn't really like a band squabble, nor was it like all of them against me, either, but it was a disagreementâthat we resolved and I won. :) Well, we all won. I would have been a wreck if I stayed up thereâthen the squabble really would have been on.    JIMMY: I think Clark was talking about my obsessive need to be on time for everything, Bo.    HUTTO: Wow, my favorite tour memory was when me and the family were touring San Diego in '79 and I stood before the Pacific Ocean on Dog Beach. The seagulls above the white-caps rose to a great height and then formed a perfect circle in flight. I had no idea I was walking on water as the seagulls harmonized in unison their strange beautiful song. I awoke in Anaheim a day later during a frightening ride through the Hall of Presidents in Disneyland. I'll never forget Lincoln. I hear Aerosmith was going through some bad times in those days, too.     What's your transpo and what's the worst place you've ever dropped trou?   CLARK: Jason's pick-up truck gets us to the shows. When is it ever not a good time to drop them drawers.   JIMMY: Hutto's truck, my Escort. Once I went potty in the worst pay toilet in Scotland.    BO: Jason's truck. I hate public restrooms, altogether. They are the worst.    HUTTO: We all agree again. I also like to pinch a loaf in my truck. I had no idea you other guys did, too.     What's the stupidest move your singer ever pulled?    CLARK: This should be interesting...   JIMMY: Well, he once jumped in the fountain at Clarendon Park during our third-to-last song, and then realized after he was soaking wet that we had two more numbers to go. OOPS!   CLARK: It's not like it was planned. But, yes, we did have two more songs...and it was really cold.    BO:  God, there's so many of them. :) Well, there was the time when Clark did some ballerina move into my kit and my set went everywhere, including the kick pedal that got contorted and completely broke right out of its holder. (Clark, you owe me, biatch.) Anyway, he did the ballerina move just about every show and screwed something up each time. I just laugh. It's more stupid than funny haha. Haha.     There was also a classic move at the Black Cat show, when Clark was trying to be all slick with the mic, and he took himself right out in the center of his forehead...the mic grill marks were funny. At the Catholic U show, Clark's dumb ass crawled out of the window behind us while we were playing (I do believe we have a picture), and one of the Dead Teenagers locked it right before he was coming back in and he was stuck out there for a minute or so. That was pretty funny, too. On that note, I love my boys; got me laughing all the time.   JIMMY: Hey, can I thank God for our continued success somewhere?   [Ed: No.]   HUTTO: I think when Clark tried going solo back in '98 backed by former members of Mr. Big. We all knew he was trying to wrap his pain in glory, but all he did was was wrap his pain in half-filled halls and lousy drum solos. Now that he's back with the band that made him a star, I've never seen him happier. I feel like now we are at the top of our game. We have become one badass rock machine fueled by the love of our fans and the respect that we have for our each other and...ourselves"

My grandfather is stricken by this awful awful disease.  More on that later. To contimue, I thought we were originally the Motorcycle Warriors, but I think it was always said so fast, that people just thought we said ""Motorcycle Wars.""  Anyway...This Blog is in thoughtful remembrance of Jason Huddo, Jimmy Askew, and Clark Sabine.  We were quite a team, but it just got complicated with a 5th member, my daughter. I was 3 months pregnant when I stopped playing drums for this crazy band.  I believe the Dead Teenagers (our rival band) think they had one on us, but they pretty much stopped playing when we did.

354830,3949634,2004-07-18,"Well, I just set up this thing...And I have nothing to say right now.  I've spent years having a clue about computers, but literally this took me awhile.  Not because I didn't get it, but trying to chase after a little one while setting up is like watching a pingpong game.  And sometimes it was almost like trying to solve a puzzle, how I got a picture to post for this new post, but no picture in my profile, and that took me quite a while to figure.  Anyway, I was inspired to do this blog by one other fellow blogger, whose entries were so fantastic.  This guy is an excellent writer.  He is soldiering in Iraq, and it has been like reading a letter from a good friend.  apolitical,  just pure human experience.  This guy writes alot like my husband (who has been working on his novel for over five years).  However, my husband was a combat veteran of the first gulf war, so it was somewhat like reading his experiences.  God, they all have these twisted, demented but hilarious stories...I mean in the way that they are explained.  Anyway, here's the other guys BLOG  ""My War Fear and Loathing in Iraq""     urlLink http://www.cbftw.blogspot.com/   I'm so tired, I don't feel like writing, nor am I giving this guy the proper credit due, see for yourself.  Interesting,  a soldier that likes punk rock.

354832,3949634,2004-08-11,"I love my grandfather...But really only because he is blood.  If it weren't for him and a mix of other things, I would not be here.  And I love my dad.  This, obviously is my father's father.  They, G-ma & G-pa S, have lived in Florida (the retirement state) for almost all their lives now.  So growing up in MD, we did not see them much. This is where they were originally from, but I guess when you get older the whether gets colder.   So we (my sibs and I) have known them from vacations every year to the sunshine state.  We would have such a good time relaxing, swimming, lots of soda, ice cream and most importantly, because the lack of in our house growing up, delicious home cooked meals.  We loved our grandparents, they were good to us, and we were very affectionate with them, said ""I love you""...But we mostly were off on our own.  Whenever we were around though, our grandfather would lovingly tell us about the first day of our lives, when he held us.  My twin sister and I would fit very snuggly in each arm. He would then stretch his arm out and point with his finger of the opposite  hand, ""Your head would be here, and your feet ended before they touched the crevice of my arm.""  I was 4 lbs 9 oz, and Allie was 3lbs 9 oz.  14 inches long, and 12 inches long, respectively.  We were tiny.  We would hear this every visit, but in my grandfathers words we'd hear the love and pride in his voice of his first grandchildren, along with a quite cute picture of Allie and I in 24 pack Michelob box as little babes (this was only for the sake of showing how small we really where, no alcoholics here, at least not on this side).    Over the last several years, we would hear this story once or twice within a couple hours.  Every visit.  That wasn't the only story - among several.  The worst one to hear was how my grandfather, when first getting back from his tour in World WarII, came home to my grandmother smoking a cigarette.  He then picked up her pack of cigarettes, tossed them out the window and said, ""If I catch you smoking any more of these, I'm gonna throw you out the window.""  My grandfather loves his wife and he would tell this story in front of her.  Granted this incident happened over 60 or so years ago -It never ceases to amaze me: he still never lost the suaveness of being such a chauvinist.  'What an Ass,' I would say to myself.  But I loved him still, all the while feeling sorry for my grandmother.   Fast forward 5 or 6 years to now.  My grandparents are both visiting my family in Maryland.  Here lives both parents, twin sis, younger brother and younger sis.  I am visiting with Campbell while husband is in Connecticut. He stopped by here last night on the way home, so he only slightly added to the three ring circus.  Think of Wagner's  Ride of the Valkyries   or anything by Wagner playing, this is what it seems like here.  My parents are working on getting my grandparents a new place to live.  With the rate of deterioration of my grandfathers brain and the fact that no one is in Florida to help them - everyone (parents and g-parents) thought it best to move them up here and into an assisted living community.  Pretty much a place where they can have autonomy, but also have the health care needed, and be not far from family.  It has taken months and still a little time now trying to convince my grandfather, that he is not going to a ""Hospital.""  Every day is a reminder about the forgotten conversation held the day before, where after a couple of hours it seemed to ""Sink in"" that he understood.  Only to start over again the following day.  Much yelling out of frustration, crying by my grandfather about the loss of his memory and everyone trying to convince grandpa that he just no longer has much control over things.  Its so hard to see what is really just an 83 year old man, and what is Alzheimer's.  The worst part about all of this, aside from convincing him to relinquish more control to others for the sake of his well being, is the comments about things here.  Particularly, his grandchildrens friends.    My younger brother and sis, have a very good mix of friends from Trinidad, Guiana,  as well as a handful of white and black kids, Hispanic, and Asian - some American born, some not.  My parents home has been a home for all of our friends - my mom has been the mother in a way to all these different kids.  Me and my sis Allie have also had so many friends that varied race, and ethnic background, culture. You get the point.  Everyone is welcome here, and my mom loved them and would often help too much to the point of enabling.  But our home was a melting pot, free of any bs.  As long as people were good to one another, they were allowed to be here.  So people are here, friends of my sibs as well as friends of mine.  But my grandfather will come up to each one of us, and comment in various points of the day about the people who are here till sometimes three in the morning, or comment about how they are going to steal stuff, or about if one of the girls sleeps with one of these guys, the baby will be ugly. Etc, etc...The funny thing is my grandfathers opinions are not only stupid, they are ignorant.  He thinks everyone with darker skin is ""black.""  As if they have no other identity, race, culture, etc..  Its annoying to listen to him, and even more of a pointless frustration to try and tell him,  ""No one is having sex!"", ""The world we live in today, the opposite sex can still hang out together and just be friends"", ""These are people, grandpa, people who we know!"" ""these are human beings, no different or better or worse than the rest of us, and on and on.  After awhile, it as if he knows the things he says are wrong or hurtful, and begins to feel bad.  He apologizes for being messed up in the head.  Again I don't know how much of this is him and how much is the head disease.    But I've heard the worst comes out in people.  Maybe not in all, but I've heard more than not, that Alzheimer's can be a living hell.  And Its embarrassing and I just don't want to be around him and cant wait till he leaves.  My grandmother is fine for the most part - and just says, ""ignore him, that's what I do.""  I think whatever state my grandfather is in, it almost reverts him back to another time, as he would say, ""when I grew up,..."" There was segregation, it was women (and only women) that were considered promiscuous (if they hung around the opposite sex and were not dating, they were sleeping around), ...""I cant do nothin no more"", or ""I use to have hundreds of men under me as a Navy Chief, and at NIH...Now I cant do anything.""    I don't know if I'm giving a complete picture of him, but my grandfather is not able to come to terms that he is not capable of physically doing much because of age and his disease.  This is something that is argued about so often.  I feel bad.  My grandparents have nothing to do, but sit around and do nothing.  My grandfather takes several naps a day.  It is truly unfortunate that they have nothing that seems to bring them joy.  No hobbies, no friends, nothing but the stillness of time passing without you.        So they are going on Friday to check this Assisted living place.  I hope they are going to live in this place.  They can get the help they need and hopefully be able to make friends and have things to do.  I think part of the problem of many things with my grandparents, is that they have been isolated...From many things that stopped any growth in many areas that could have improved their lives.     Not to mention the sooner they get in, the sooner they are out of my parents house, which is stressing everyone out.  Including me and I don't live here anymore.  I'm all the sudden apart of everything that is wrong with my sibs friends, as if I have anything to do with what goes on here.  My ex boyfriend and his wife where here with a couple of other friends the other day, and my grandfather completely went back into his ""anger/disappointed mode"" about who we all hang with.   Not seeming to realize that I have my own family in another state, and I'm married, and so is my exboyfriend, who I'm am wonderfully good friends and his awesome wife.  My grandfather is ""Blurring"" my twin sis, my self and my younger sister together, as if he is talking to the same person about the same problem.  I'm like ""grandpa, I'm Bonnie, remember I have a husband and a daughter, I dont live here.""  This is giving me a headache writing this, but this is on my mind and its making me feel crazy.   So maybe all of this doesnt make sense right now, but im not seeming to have the space to focus on this completely. so whatever...hope thi smakes sense on some level"
354833,3949634,2004-08-07,"Such a pretty blossom, only lasts for about a couple hours at most maybe, before it starts to wilt and die.  The fragrance of this flower is delicious, very deep, but subtle.  Reminds me of my dear friend Amanda's perfume.  The perfume was called McLintock.  I think.  I could be wrong.  This is a memory from high school when myself and another best friend pretty much lived at her house. This scent reminds me of that time, of carefree nonsense.  The plant continues to grow, but the bloom passes very quickly.  I got home from the store with Campbell, when I noticed the neighbors, all 4 of them, just staring at the ground all huddled together on their front step like they were watching a worm die in the evening sun.  It wasn't a worm though, it was a Moon flower plant that they moved to a new location so that it could get more sun.  Apparently, it looked much healthier when in more sunlight, than in not. But it will only bloom in the evening, then fold back up to its immediate ending with a kiss from the morning sun.    There was one lonesome bloom, a beautiful long, white bud that untwines itself as it opens.  When Campbell and I went over to have a look, we just stared for about 10 minutes.  There was a ruler placed under this bloom so that you could watch the measurement of it widen as it blossomed.  You didn't need a ruler though.  It's petals were clearly, and visibly moving.  Like one of those Disney/TLC shows that recorded a flowers growth on a camera in a matter of days, but when they post it to a program, you watch a bloom unfold, or fold back up in a matter of 30 seconds.  That was this flower, but in real time.    Standing back a good 4 or 5 feet, you could watch this flower, in all its splendor, twitch, vibrate, and shake a little as it opened its face to the world.  This was unreal, I stood in awe.  This was just a flower before I watched, but was a living thing that spoke to me as I stood there.  I wanted to say, ""Thank you, gorgeous Moon Flower.""  And then, I realized, that might sound a little silly, and the neighbors might look at me like I'm wierd. (more about that later).   But when watching this, it had something to say to me.  At least, this is the way in which God speaks to me."
354834,3949634,2004-08-05,"Its so funny how now that I am a mom I just can't listen to all the heavy and harder stuff I use to listen to.  Especially, when Campbell is listening.  Here's a list of some thing we can, right off the top of my head.   1.   Beach Boys   - Pet Sounds  2.   Elizabeth Mitchell's (of Ida)  solo album - You are my Sunshine 3.  Any album from  U2  4.  Any song from  Sara Harmer  5.   The Be Good Tanya's  - Blue Horse 6.  Any song from  Jolie Holland  7.  Anything from  Cold Play  8.   Cat Power's  - You are free 9.  Most anything from  Aimme Mann  10. Any of the following: Blues, Jazz, Classical (any period), Swing, Bluegrass, some funk, various instrumental, almost any soundtrack I own, and some hiphop (mostly Outkast).  I could be missing some, and this could also change.  That's motherhood.  Presently though, the most music we listen to together is in the car, about 45 various mix tapes, but mostly the VA Tech Radio station which is excellent, and that is a good mix of various punk, indie rock, jazz, funk, folk, hiphop, electronic, random stuff, etc. - The list that most College Stations have, but this is truly a great radio station.  I'll re-edit if I think of more.    My husband on the other hand, will put on 1.  Tom Petty (This I don't mind) 2.  Metallica (This sounds just scary to me if I was a little girl) 3.  U2 4.  Lynyrd  Skynyrd 5.  Led Zeppelin (I do Love Led Zeppelin though, just not always so listenable with your daughter) 6.  Alice in Chains 7.  Smashing Pumpkins 8.  Foo Fighters 9.  Random from Aerosmith, Pearl Jam, Pink Floyd, Chevelle, REM, Elizabeth Mitchell.  Sometimes I say, ""Do you have to play this stuff?"", followed by ""It just sounds so dark and negative and a downer on the psyche, ya know""   I will clarify though, that this is what he mostly listens to when working out (with the exception of Elizabeth Mitchell.)  His response ""Whatever, Campbell likes it.""  'Yeah, right' I think to myself, just like I like to bang my head against the wall, and run a hot iron over my foot.  Anyway, who knows, she might like it.  I just know the feeling I get when I hear certain things.  I just want to hold my hands over her ears.  Tangent...Speaking of holding hands over ears.  I thought ""Old School"" was hilarious.  Vince Vaughn with the kid.  If we all could just do this, so the kids wouldn't hear."
354835,3949634,2004-08-03,"* This was copied word for word from ALa71's Blog.  Very poignant and Beautiful.  It only made sense to post it here, too.  Entitled because this is what I think ""The Movie"" of this story would be appropriately titled.  (To be honest, the movie  Butterfly Effect  was cheesy, but interesting nonetheless about the whole scheme of life.  And so it goes, as redundent as it may seem for those of you who saw the movie.  This theory has been around long way before the movie.) According to the Chaos theory, pressented was a question: ""Predictability: Does the Flap of a Butterfly's Wings in Brazil set off a Tornado in Texas?"" so on that note... Here is her post:  His War: Our Soldier     FOX NEWS: ANCHOR-We are getting reports of a car bomb that has gone off in Baghdad âtentative reports say it may be in front of a Christian Churchâ¦wait we are getting the first pictures. The smoke looks very black, can this really be a car bomb or was a fuel station hit?  REPORTER-No, this is a car bomb âthey have gotten very good at making them out here.  ME: Thatâs was CB said the other day.  HUSBAND: Yeah, I know.  SISTER: Who is CB?  ME: Heâs our soldierâ¦    Mine, justroseâs, ~Jen~âs, 91Ghostâs, EXFBonnieâs, ThisWeâllDefendâs (the list is endless)â¦.he has become âour soldierâ, and many of us are here because we started reading his site and ours evolved from there.   Fox News: Anchor:We are also getting reports there was a bomb in Mosulâ¦    My heart sinksâ¦I will be checking every hour to see if CB posted now. How did this stranger become such an important part of my life? I have been thinking about this all day as I fretted over the fact that he has yet to post at 10pm EST. What if something happened to him? How will we know? Do his parents know about the site? His wife?   No matter what our politics of origin, those of us who flock to his site -(for the most part) leave them behind there. It is a sanctuary from the vitriol. There we donât care so much if itâs Bush or Kerry âwe only care to know that heâs OK and that he continues to feed our addiction to war-real-time. Maybe somewhere deep down we all feel guilty (stateside guilt I always say)â¦if we read each and every day we are involved âinvested even.    JUSTICE: Mom, I want to see what CB looks like.  ME: You canât, he canât put his picture up.  JUSTICE: You have yours there.  ME: I am not at war.    Sometimes I feel like we are all being selfish âmaybe not consciously, but selfish none-the-less. We want confirmation to validate our point of viewâ¦ âSee he says that he is mad at Bush for stop-lossâ¦â âNo see, he said that he thinks it would be a slap in the face to vote for Kerryâ¦â and so on...   I notice reading the posts that many try to slip in their views --scantily veiled in âconcernââ¦âCB, I am undecided, but vote Kerry so maybe you can home quicker.â In some small way maybe we all want him to justify all that we have said-- for or against the war.    ME: Dad, have you read the soldier blog that is linked to my site yet?  DAD: It takes me long enough to read everything on yours.  ME: Read his instead then, you will love itâ¦read his. Ya know what he said the worst pick up line in Iraq is?  DAD: What?  ME: Are you a terrorist, cause you da bombâ¦.    Here is a person that I have never metâ¦a person who has no first nameâ¦no faceâ¦yet a friend. His words have become so familiar âso anticipated. He seems to be the embodiment of all that is good in this country. A heroâ¦.yet he is often blunt, disgruntledâ¦and human. A visitor to his site once pointed out that the âhawksâ were overlooking glaring signs that say, âAnti-warâ âthe painting choice, the link to Hunter Thompsonâ¦but I think thatâs what I find so wonderful. He seems mad about the war sometimes âyet the next day touched by a gesture from a local. He listens to SOD, but reads Hunter Thompson. He comes from a republican family âyet contemplates a vote for Nader.   ME: Do you think more than one person writes CBâs page?  JUSTROSE: Why?  ME: Because he just doesnât make sense. Hunter Thompson said that he would rip off the heads and piss down the neck of this Nazi administrationâ¦.  JUSTROSE: No, itâs just himâ¦   I disagree with those who constantly tell him to go to school for writing/journalism. Academia will steal his edge and attempt to reign in his raw talent and passion. His writing is real and prompts many of us to respond with words of comfort and well-wishes each day.  The things that many of us say/want to say to him ââWe are proud of youâ, âStay safeâ, âThank you for what you are doingââ¦seem to ring hollow typed in the comments section of the blogâ¦but I know they are all truly from each personâs heart.  There is no figuring this soldier out âand thatâs why he is everyoneâs soldierâ¦he is our soldier.  *For anyone that hasnât read CBFTWâs site âplease do at http://cbftw.blogspot.com/"

And that is why weâve decided to have our wedding vows in The Chapel of the Transfiguration, Caleruega, Batulao, Batangas. And the reception will be somewhere in Tagaytay (most probably).     I didnât exactly plan to have my wedding outside the metropolis but as Ezra have carefully conveyed her plan for my wedding; I was so excited that Iâve decided right there and then that Caleruega it is! We talked about almost everything, from the motif to the centerpieces, to the flower and plants for the chapel, the cake, the gown, the entourage, the flower girls, the place to stay, the giveaways for principal sponsors and guests, the receptionâ¦Gosh, there are so many things to do! And may I not forget the churchâs requirements (birth certificate, confirmation, counseling) Thank God for Wedding Coordinators!  Though we have not visited the place yet, and have not made any deposit or reservations, Iâd say this would definitely be itâ¦weâre schedule to make an ocular visit on Aug 14 (hope it pushes through). I wonât be sharing in detail what the plans will be for the big day ( so that there will be an element of surprise)â¦ just as a teaser, Iâd say my wedding will have a Nature Spring Theme. :)"
365703,3841566,2004-07-26,"My whole day was pretty boring, but it was kind of funny at work. Me and my friend Charles Vanover were bringing in a train of carts, it was 30 carts, and this fat lady walked over a curb and tripped. It was kinda funny but I felt kinda sorry for her. That was close to another time a fat lady fell. It was at MJR last summer and we were leaving from a movie, I don't remember what it was, and she fell going to her car that her husband or so drove up to pick her up. If you ever looked at the sidewalk near the entry before about 3 months ago there was dark pavement stuff there because the lady broke it. Well now they fixed it and it looks better now but she did break it really bad. Also at work with Scott Stoinski there was some bad carts, you know the ones that can't move right, and we had to bring them to the back of the store with other bad carts. Yea well while we were doing that we ran on the backs of them there are we threw them into the the fence. Well a cop drove up to us and was like ""why were you riding those carts"". Scott said that's were the carts go. The cop said ""was the fence bad that you needed to throw them, and you could get fired"". I was really scared just because it was a cop. Those were the major highlights of my day."

I can't wait till the the pain goes away, actually I can't wait till I get them off. I only have to wear them fo 9 months, and what some people tell me that it is not that long compared to how long they had to have them on. After my appointment I went and called Aaron Tinsley. I drove over to his house for the first time, and I also went in my car by myself too. At around 3:30 is when my teeth started to hurt but I had to go home to get ready for work. It made me mad at my mom that I still had to drive to work with her. I only have about 40 hours of driving time, shhhhh. That doesn't mean that I can't drive to work by myslf because it is not that hard. Work wasn't that hard because I got to put items away again.

If you didn't know I also bought a car. It is a 99 ZX-2 Escort with a black exterior. I got it for $5000 with tax, title, and license. They were asking $7000 for it by itself so I got a good deal on it. It drives really good but it is only a 4-cylinder chamber for it doesn't have very good acceleration, but that doesn't matter. I also bought a TV from my friend today so I don't know what the screen size is but it is a wide screen. I would say it is a 20'' screen. It is really nice though. I am still waiting for my N64 expansion pack I ordered over the internet on May 7, 2004. It really makes me mad that I waited so long, and that I am still waiting for it.

367100,3702078,2004-06-21,"i thought i'd take this opportunity to share a bit of south african history...  wednesday, the 16th, was national youth day here in south africa.  the day  celebrates june 16th, 1976, when student uprisings began in soweto. i've mentioned soweto a number of times - it's actually a group of townships  southwest of johannesburg (hence the name: SoWeTo stands for south-west  townships).  the township these days is a mix of extreme poverty and extremely  wealthy black families (winnie mandela, nelson mandela's former wife, has a  house in one of the neighborhoods), but is famous historically for its  political activism - desmond tutu and nelson mandela, for example, both grew up  there.   in any case, during the apartheid era, blacks (and coloreds, as i've mentioned  before) were confined to townships outside of the almost exclusively white  cities and forced into a 'bantu education system,' where they were made to  study in afrikaans, and in which their own history was given no regard at all. june 16th, 1976 was the beginning of the end of the educational system and  ultimately apartheid - students and young people took to the streets  demonstrating against the forced educational system and disregard for their own  culture and history.   these days anyone  visiting soweto will be taken to the hector peterson memorial/museum - a shrine  to the first casualty of the uprisings and one of the three subjects of an  internationally famous photo of him being carried by his sister and a friend to  a nearby church for help (the church, incidentally, is the one where my boss'  father preached).  peterson was the first among many killed on june 16th for  publically demonstrating against bantu education and the system of repression  practiced by the apartheid regime. the amazing thing is how fresh this history all is  here - even more so than i've experienced in israel, which still only  celebrated its 56th independence day this year.  here so much of apartheid  still lingers on in mentalities that these celebrations are fierce  demonstrations of how much things still need to change, as much as they  celebrate how much things already have and south africa's ability to make a  peaceful transition from one of the most racist political systems on earth to  one of the world's most participatory democracies.    speaking of transition/democracy/peace and justice... a few minutes after i hit 'send' on last week's email, i was called into  my 'orientation' meeting with the office director.  i should have had this  meeting last monday when i arrived, but since another intern was arriving that  morning, ivor (the office director) put it off until he was around as well.   the meeting was basically administrative, but ivor began by discussing a bit  what it means to be an american in south africa.  in particular he was talking  about the anti-americanism in this country, or rather anti-bush administration- ism.  the key point, he said, is that south africans feel that if ever an  internal war (civil war, i suppose) were justified, it was justified in south  africa - - and that south africans very very strongly feel that if they were  able to resolve such deep-rooted problems without resorting to warfare, the  rest of the world should be able to, as well. hence the nearly universal  opposition here to the war in iraq, hence strong anti-israeli feelings  (although i have to say i personally haven't felt any less comfortable  introducing myself to people as an israeli than as an american).  hey, that's what i am here for, right? to learn about how south africa has  managed to resolve some of its deep-seated problems, and take some of those  approaches and adapt them to the conflict region i'm from and conflict regions  where other methods haven't worked...and get there before the situation  disintegrates to another iraq, or another kosovo, or another haiti.    an interesting point ivor made about the anti-americanism is that south  africans right now are distinguishing between american citizens and the bush  administration...but that if bush is re-elected in november, things may change  as the perception will be that americans supported bush overall.    i was thinking about these things as i went sight-seeing in pretoria this  weekend (actually, sight-seeing was second priority to seeing the south african  musical 'sarafina,' but unfortunately my pals and i didn't buy our tickets  early enough and it sold out.  i guess even some things here don't quite fit  into the 'african time' concept...). in any case, i spent yesterday afternoon walking through historical pretoria -  in particular, the union buildings (seat of government) and church square (home  to the provincial supreme court and other various municipal buildings). i have to say i was thoroughly unimpressed with both places.  sure, the  architecture is gorgeous, and the grounds of the union buildings are immaculate  and full of flowers...but they seem to have no soul.  maybe it's because the  opulence of the union buildings and surrounding gardens stands uncomfortably  juxtaposed with the slightly seedy downtown areas right near it...but more  likely, i think, is because of what these buildings represent: a racist,  xenophobic regime whose day has long passed.  true, the union buildings are  still the seat of government (and the scene of this year's 10-year anniversary  of ""the new south africa"") and the buildings in church square are still used  for various civic functions, but their grandeur is a reminder of what south  africa used to be - nelson mandela was tried in the palace of justice, where  the supreme court now sits, and the apartheid policies were carefully designed  where mbeke now sits as president of the republic.  a statue of paul kruger -  one of the early and most vehement leaders of apartheid - still stands at the  center of church square.   so yes, i'm glad i visited - - but the splendor of the two areas is marred for  me.  i certainly don't feel a need to return (although, there is a nice little  crafts market near the union buildings...i may have to return for some gifts!)  continuing on the political note... i forgot to mention that last weekend (saturday, the 12th) the olympic torch  came through south africa - capetown, specifically. this is the first time  south africa was a site in which the torch was carried, and it was a very, very  big deal.  torch carriers and runners ranged the gamit from politicians to  political activists to celebrated atheletes and community members.  nelson  mandela held the torch on robben island, where he was imprisoned for over 20  years.  the torch was there only from about 7AM until late afternoon, but  advertisements on television for the entire week preceding demonstrated the  poignance and momentousness of this occasion - another indicator of just how  far south africa has come from its history of apartheid and isolation from  international support.   on the opposite end was political coverage of ronald reagan's funeral.  reagan  is viewed here very negatively for his interactions with the apartheid regime,  and it took a few days for thembo mbeke (south africa's president) to say  anything positive about him - despite the fact that the decision to extend  mbeke's sojourn in DC (he was there for the G8 summit) so that he could attend  the funeral was made as soon as reagan's death became public information.   overall here press coverage of the incident was definitely on the negative  side, even from the more conservative news channels.     but, enough of history and politics for now. my sojourn here so far has been  shaped by all kinds of 'south africa moments' and experiences...  just as one example: as i walked over to a nearby shopping complex saturday  morning to buy a converter a man was sitting outside singing and hoping that  passer-byes would fill his cup with change.  no different, one might say, from  street musicians anywhere in the world.  the difference was, he was singing  christmas hymns in zulu. it's an indication of how large a role religion plays  in this country - politically as well as personally as well as economically.   and a truly south african moment.      and as an update to my falling-in-love-at-first-sight experience last week:  when i left my flat yesterday to go buy some groceries, the guy selling  newspapers on the corner was there yet again...and as i passed by, he smiled  flirtatiously, said good-morning and called me by name. at first i was amazed that he remembered me - after all, despite professing his  love, he really did only see me once, for five minutes, a week before - and was  a bit angry at myself for not remembering his (romantic interest or not, i felt  i was being rude in some ways by not taking the trouble to remember it).  but  after a few minutes i realized that really, recalling what MY name is and who i  am is almost to be expected - after all, as a white person - and more  specifically, as a petite, brown-haired white woman - i certainly stand out in  my predominantly black neighborhood.   with this came the additional realization that this is the probably the first  time in my life i've lived somewhere where i am visibly in the minority.  it's  hard to realize how easy it is to take majority status for granted, even when  i'm conscious of it.   so in that sense south africa is becoming as much of a learning experience  about myself as it is about the culture, history, and traditions here...  that's it for today - - karen's monday morning (well, afternoon) philosophical  waxing.  have a wonderful summer (winter) solstice everyone - - i know i'm  looking forward to the start of longer days in this part of the world!  much love, karen"

378510,1510754,2004-06-24,"Alrighty.  All good things must come to an end and today's events were proof enough of that. We left Joe's [trumpet/vocals] house this morning after having had a long and productive rehearsal the day before. The plan was to meet up at the conservatory around noon or so and squeeze in another rehearsal before we headed off to Harvard Square for a gig.  I know I promised to add some details about yesterday but there really isn't much to say...  ..'cept that we got a new bass player and he got all of our tunes down in less than 30 min.  ..all of them.  The kid is remarkable.  So back to today's rehearsal...  We rocked out for about an hour - we were still beat despite having gotten a good night's rest and we decided to call it quits a little earlier than we had originally planned. I went back to the apartment for a shower and some rest and, before I knew it, I was waking up and getting dressed [in my BCB best] for the gig in Harvard Square.  We rocked...  ...hard as hell.  2 sets and 23 dollars later (including a 5 dropped in our bucket by some awesome guy) we packed up and went our seperate ways for the most part. 3 of us decided to get a bite and discuss the gig.  We had done so well... many people were impressed and, what's more, we got a fair amount of people asking us for CD's. The band, in it's current form, had existed for less than 24 hours...  ...rock...  We even got an offer from a guy who wanted to design our website for free.  [money]  So that was good. We chatted about that and some other things while munching on our whatevers at a PIzzaria Uno's around the block from the NEC.  A dude tried to sell us all crack.  Apparently, if you don't smoke crack, you're gay. He ""put two and two together"" as he said.  Wow.  I got a ride home from Tom and, after some goodbyes, I headed up to my apartment.  I'm not so sure that I'm coming back to CT. We'll see. More on that later I suppose.  For now, I'm still jazzed about the awesome job we did [kickass!] and am preparing to maybe get to bed early - early for me anyway.  Another day's journey all but done...   [zzz...]"
378511,1510754,2004-06-25,"Yesterday (Thursday) was fairly tame.  I woke up and, after showering and such, headed over to see Mike Winograd [sax/vocals/baffonery] to discuss his band's website. It was about a mile walk to his apartment across wavy baking concrete and past smoldering buildings. My sweet Jesus do I ever love summer. I got to his apartment and we talked shop for a while. I learned what Yiddish is [joy], had a midday shot of JD [wow], and then it was back to my apartment for some ""webtastic funnery"".  I forgot the power chord to my laptop at his apartment.  He wouldn't be back until late.  There was no way in hell I was resorting to the iMac.  [damn it!]  So, except for a brief freakout, I sat there in my apartment and read. Which wasn't bad. I now have copies of ""Dude Where's My Country"" and ""Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them"".  It was likely the most leftist afternoon of my life.  Eventually, I got a call from Mike and, armed with Sean, headed over there to retrieve my power chord... exciting, I know.  After that, I pretty much chatted with Sean unaware that the night was disolving into a pale dawn. By then, we were both insane with exhaustion and sleep was inevitable.  [ZZZzzz...]  ...and today?   I woke up fairly late [yes!] and jumped right into ""Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them""... brilliant work, Mr. Franken. Then it was and afternoon/evening with ""The Eyes of the Dragon""... oh and a nap... and a bunch of hot dogs... so...  yeah...  I mean that was it - I chatted up a bunch of folk online, read some more, listened to the Avenue soundtrack  [Dobber: Take her home, she's wasted!] [Dexter: YAAAAAAAAAAAY!!!!!!!!!!!]  and that's about that. It's 9:30 on a Friday night and I have no plans to speak of for the evening. How sad (and rare) is that? S'ok mostly. I'm all about reading and, for the time being, I may just occupy myself with that. Tommorow may include a visit from my brother and [crossing fingers] a trip home.

So thereâ¦  Alrighty - the silence ends here.    6.26.2004 â 6.30.2004 - Saturday Night Leaver   Saturday was very much like a  urlLink bad porno  - not really that hot, terribly long, and horribly boring.   [I'm looking at you, Snatch Adams...]  I ended up talking with Pete (Matt Peters) and, wouldn't you know it, he came up... I mean... wow. So... there you go... huh (awesome!). So he came up and, after I got over my initial surprise (and after giving him about 3 tours of my apartment), we were off to see the city. It was a lot of me saying  ""...and this is where I...""  or  ""...that's where they..."" ... I was the city's worst tour guide. Pete seemed to enjoy himself.  We stopped over at Woody's and had a pizza and some beer - thank you Pete... [hug].  It was then back to the apt where we met Sean and relaxed a bit on the roof playing guitar.  ...and then Pete said "" urlLink casino "".  That's all it took really.   Granted, there was a bit more to the conversation but, for my fingersâ sake, Iâll leave it at that.   To the casino! [ kapwing! ]  By the time we crossed over into CT, I was asleep and all hopes of lining the natives' pockets with sweet hard earned American cash had faded to nothing. So be it. Pete dropped me off at my old Apt and, with a little effort, I went to bed. The next week was a collage of video games, barbequed whatnots, sleep [my preciousssss], and a whole lot of Flash MXâ¦ soâ¦ yeah. Thatâs where Iâve been for the last week.

Finally, the  Boston City Band  was playing Middleford.  [Hallelujah Chorus]  Can you say bucolic Christian paradise? And free soda at the end of the parade? â [sigh] - What a wonderful slice of Northeastern Americana! For my money, it doesn't get any better than Jesus and tractors [insert club remix of Plowin' with my Savior by DJ Whatshisnuts]. Anywho, the parade was decent and fairly uneventful. Which was kinda disappointing. THE  urlLink vendor  was spotted at least once and I was secretly hoping for a follow-up battle. Unfortunatlly, it was not in the cards.   [le sigh]  After taking advantage of the sweet free sodee-pop, The  BCB  packed it up and moved it out. Back in Boston, we went our separate ways and I prepared Casa Drew for Chris Buckâs arrival. I had almost forgotten that he was coming up. Buck showed up and, wouldnât you know it, I had been invited to a party at Kyleâs [Seanâs older brother] place.  Sweeeeeeeet.  We ate din-din at Woodyâs [god bless you bacon and pepperoni pizza!] and then high-tailed it to JP for some buffoonery.  I got the worst case of  urlLink hiccups  of my life. Hands down.  I canât really describe it better than that except to say that it was plain awful and I had âmassive nuclear meltdownâ heartburn. I was hiccupping every 15 seconds and letting out these horrendous âhalf-burpsâ. Jesus. What a bad scene. Sleep couldnât come fast enough.  And now? â As I write this, itâs 5:42 in the morning on the fourth of July, Chris Buck is sleeping like a lilâ baby Jesus on my couch, and my day looks something like this:   9amish â 11ish  Mom is visiting and weâre going out to breakfast.

378513,1510754,2004-07-05,"Ok - let review...  According to my  urlLink last post , my schedule for today ( in italics ) was as follows:    9amish â 11ish  Mom is visiting and weâre going out to breakfast. Thatâs rightâ¦ mom is visiting. I have so much crap to clean/hide.   That never happened. My aunt, who would have tagged along, had car trouble which translated to no visit from mom. It was disappointing but so be it. I'm sure she'll make it up some other time. And we at least got some phone shennanigans in leiu of a person to person visit. For now, I'm willing to be content with that.    11amish â 6pmish Parades! Parades! Parades!  What a whore I amâ¦ 2 parades today on this, our independence day [cue patriotic music]. If I didnât so desperately need the money I swearâ¦ though in all honesty Iâd probably still do a few here and there. I mean, heh, Iâm not above the BCB, baby. [foâ shizzle]   Well now... here's how  that  dance of shame went down...  We met up at the good ol'  urlLink NEC  (standard) and headed off with absolutly  no idea  of how to get where we were going (also standard). After some slick maphandling skills on my part [translation: I found the town on the map - big accomplishment for me] we were headed west to the town of  urlLink Sudbury .  Despite the cops who, all of which, seemed to be entirely uninterested in giving us directions to either the start of the parade or a place where we could park, we found a place to seat Tom's oh so choice Volvo and we unloaded. 10 min later, freshly shirted, shod, and bearing instruments, we trucked over to meet the rest of the band.  It was hotter than a lesbian daisy chain outside. The sky was a hectic blue and the sun glared mercilessly down on our motley crew. Needless to say, after about 40 yards, we were panting and sweating. A lil' group of politically inclinded Sudburians saw our plight and offered us ice water. God Bless them. Soon after, the bands (Wooster Brass and Boston City) formed like Voltron and we set out for to make a spectacle of ourselves.  The parade, though long and brutally hot, was awesome. Every 5 yards, someone was offering us ice water. The crowd not only smiled and waved but cheered and clapped along to whatever we happened to be playing... including the cadance. Barbeques burned, cute children were in abundance, and we were encouraged onward by a sea of amiling faces. I've hardly ever seen a more appreciative crowd - never with the BCB.  Don't get me wrong now, kids. The parade was still a hellish nightmare festival (again, standard). However, Sudbury definitly made me feel appreciated.  Hail to thee, fair Sudbury!  The parade ended without much hullabaloo and, you guessed it, it was off to parade number two - this time in  urlLink Norwood . This one wasn't nearly as inviting as Sudbury.  The parade was set to begin at 4:30 which fit perfectly into my earlier made plans to hang out with Buck from about 6 on. When we got there, we found out the parade had been moved up an hour to 5:30. No Biggie. Then we waited around forever - well past 5:30. My plans with Chris (Buck) were shot to hell. Finally, after an eternity or two, we were on the parade route and doing our Boston City bestest to ""hype the crowd"". About midway through [stopped on the route - hindered by a troupe of gypsies - hand to god] our Tuba player somehow got a fan club. A bunch of [hopelessly adorable] kids came up and were standing off at a bit of a distance trying to figure out what the hell it was that he was carrying. He did a great thing... he scared the bejesus out of 'em by growling in a huge voice through the Sousaphone and chasing the little kids. It was wonderful. He played with these kids until it was time to move on. The kids were deliriously happy. The Tuba player earned a bit more of my respect. What a swell guy. We finished up the parade without incident and, after a few hangups (totaling a little more than an hour), we were on our way back to Boston. By now it was about 9:20 PM and I would have gotten back to Boston by around 9:45 had we not run across that damned Krispy Kreme.  It's even better than you can imagine.  We walked in, brought our instruments, played, and got 2 dozen doughnuts.   Free.   Clearly, no one can resist the power of the BCB. After that, it was off to home for me.   6pmish - whenever, baby Chris Buck and I are going out for a night on the town... a night we won't soon forget! [insert 80's power rock ballad here] Jillian's fits into our plans somewhere. Evening, thy name is Jackassery!   I was met by a calm and understanding Chris Buck on my stoop. I was more than 3 hours late and, though it had been out of my control, it still sucked hard. There was really only one option for us at this point.  We went to  urlLink Jillian's  - three stories of beer, pool, bowling [that's right] and a number of other fun things - and right next to  urlLink Fenway !. Jillian's is HUGE! Bigger than all the Uconn bars combined... easily... and on three floors, my friends. We ended our night with beer, chicken, and billards.  Good times.  Home was a short walk away. Just how short, you ask?    [note: if the image doesn't show, visit  urlLink http://www.frankpipe.com/fenwayjillian.jpg  to see what I'm talking about.]  Which brings me to now... tired yet content and staring down the barrel of another parade in the AM. Wish me luck, kids. For now, I'm heading to dreamland.   Zzz..."
378514,1510754,2004-07-06,"Today, the BCB went over to bless the town of Needham with our sultry siren song repetoire of ill fated obscure military marching band compositions. All towns should be so lucky. Oh, and we had a dozen of the Krispy Kreme donughts left from  urlLink the day before . And the parade promised to be short and sweet. So... awesome! We drove over and found the town with little trouble. It was parking that was a problem.  There were  clowns  in the parking lot.  2 troops of  clowns .  My heart was set to ""hummingbird"".  No matter - the clowns didn't give us any trouble. We warmed up a bit, got into our parade block and marched a very short [and friggin wet] parade. The rain wasn't all that bad seeing as how the parade was mindlessly short. When it was all over, we collected our checks and started the short trek back to our cars.  ...and then there were clowns...  On the way back to our car, we saw a pair of them - one on a clown bike and one on foot in those super evil clown shoes that they wear. Crestfallen and soaked (due to the rain... which made their make-up streaky and all the more frightening) they ambled down the road in the same direction we were headed. Mike Winograd [Frankpipe - sax/vocals/keys] whips out his clarinet and plays a ""happy clown song"" to cheer them up. They ignore us entirely. This was not taken well by Jesse, one of our number, who immediatly busted out with ""Everybody hates clowns!"". The clowns hung their heads in shame and continued walking (all the more depressed) back to their car.  Back at the cars, we began stripping of the Boston City Band getups and putting on our ""less dignified"" street clothes. The clowns were there too, though they showed no sign of changing clothes any time soon. We still had donughts from the day before, thank God, and a mini snackfest broke out.  Something about the doughnuts spooked the clowns.  The clowns parked near us saw the box of donughts and  FLIPPED OUT  - hard. They started by talking amongst themselves in some ""other"" language [Clownese or something] all scary high and creepy. It was all so surreal. Finally, they reached some sort of consensus and one of them [their leader?] screamed:   ""Donughts! Attack!""   ...in a crazy high shrill voice.  If my pants weren't around my ankles, I would have gotten the hell out of dodge right then and there.  Thank God we left soon after. They had started hitting on Jesse (who is 14 years old by the way - they hit on him more when we told them this) and it was clear that it was time to get gone. We escaped with our lives [whew!] and made it back to Boston in one piece. I retreated to my apartment and promptly passed out.  The rest of the day was clown free; Spider Man 2 (wicked awesome), some decent potato skins, and now this - posting. Tommorow is looking to be fairly uneventful and I'm looking forward to that. Though I wouldn't mind an adventure or two...  ...so long as there are  no clowns ...  zzz..."
378515,1510754,2004-07-07,"Ok, kids. Here it is, as promised â a small list of the strange and wonderful cast of Bostonites that Iâve met since Iâve been here. Iâll try and lump them into relevant groups so you all donât get lost. Letâs get started.   Frankpipe!   Frankpipe is the reason Iâm in Boston. Weâre a Zappa-esque rock band with damn near innumerable influences. Here is Frankpipe in no particular orderâ¦   Sean Frenette  Best friend since high school â wicked guitar player â mildly eccentric â lead guitar   Joe âJomoâ Moffett  The Pipeâs front man â awesome trumpet player â balls to the wall insane and funny â trumpet/lead vocals   Mike Winograd  Token Jew â best clarinet player Iâve ever heard â pop music fanatic â sax/keys/vocals   Dave Goodchild  Frankpipe newbie â ungodly talented bassist  â ridiculously quick study â bass   Thomas Monaghan  Buthole Bob â sick percussionist â BCB demigod â drums   Me  Dexter aka âThe Revâ â struggling beginner guitarist â negro extrodinaire â trombone/vocals     The Boston City Band/Wooster Brass Band/Windjammer Band/etc.    These are all actually the same band technically speaking. I wonât get into it here. Check out my  urlLink previous post  concerning that whole deal. Here they are in no particular order:   Trombone Nazi(s)  - one of the many old men who play drum major from within the ranks of the BCB. They calls the tunes, they bark the starts and stops, and they critique your playing and marching no matter how awful they themselves are. Nothing is âBoston Cityâ enough for the Nazis. Oh, and if you couldnât tell from their title, they all play trombone. Theyâre never really referred to by name.   The Bunny Hat Lady or Madame Vericose  -  crooked teeth, large glassy eyes, tired sallow skin, and a healthy crop of varicose veins are all her trademark features. She wears the drum major uniform but, trust me, kids, she is anything but a drum major. She, too, barks commands or, on occasion, blows her whistle. She may or may not do either in tandem with one of the Trombone Nazis â and, by the way, ALL commands given by her or the Nazis are not at all in time. She wields this drum major mace like some geriatric ninja. I would not be surprised if she had a bad case of jaundice or the goutâ¦ or both. On her head, she wears this ultra-fabulous fluffy white super bonnet. Hence the title âBunny Hat Ladyâ.   Hardcore! Drummer  - Sheâs been marching parades for YEARS and, damn it, she is the very definition of a hardcore drummer when it comes to parade time. Her hands are bandaged and knotted with arthritis but she plays with the fierceness of an entire snare line. Donât get me wrong â sheâs not in the same class as the Nazis or the Bunny Hat Lady. She is one of the sweetest women in the BCB â super friendly, soft spoken, always smiling, and downright loveable.   The Glockenspiel Lady  - Oh boy. What a wonder! Ok. Damn the physical description. Imagine a glockenspiel player whoâs understanding of tonality is light years beyond that of most mere mortals. She plays  whatever she wants  regardless of the key signature (though, before each tune, she turns to ask the Trombone Nazi what key the piece is in). In all honesty, that may be an understatement. I have never once heard her play in any discernable key whatsoever. Itâs rather miraculous. Added to that, she marches like a cartoon character and has no concept of gate turns. Good thing she marches solo in front of the band.   Russel K. Wiesman aka Russ  - The very heart and soul of the BCB â our fearless leader. Though he does not march, Russ is responsible for everything else BCB related including doling out paychecks at the end of each parade. He often follows behind the band during parades in his trademark white van. The parade life can get hectic and, as a result, it is generally a bad idea to try and talk to Russ before a parade begins. He has no time for your nonsense.     Sometimes She Burns [ urlLink SSB ]   This is Seanâs older brother Kyleâs band. Theyâre damn good. Check out their  urlLink website â¦ w00t:   Kyle Frenette  â Guitar/Vocals â My other big broâ¦ constantly looking out for me and/or filling me with beer. My storytelling skills pale in comparison.   Ken Dziok  â Drums â Nasty drummer with a heart of Pabst. Newest in a long line of SSB drummers â all around decent guy.   Miguel Paucar  â Guitar/Vocals â Miguel is probably my favorite guitar player to watch. The kid plays with freakish amounts of energy â goddamn you if you donât dance. Rolls his own cigarettes and, again, is an all around decent guy.    Corinto Cevallos [?]  â Bass â Corinto is the only member of the band that Iâve never once spoken to or interacted with in any way. He tends to disappear after shows and Iâve only seen him at one partyâ¦ soâ¦ I mean I guess thatâs that.      Other Friendly Neighborhood Bostonites      Brother Blue  â Heâs a multi-degree carrying, world traveling storyteller â Bostonâs official storyteller, in fact. Phenomenally brilliant, gifted, and moreover, friendly and approachable. He has a storytelling session on Tuesday nights in Cambridge.   Ruth Edmonds Hill  â The wife of Blueâ¦ equally intelligent, sheâs the glue that keeps Blue together and, honestly, vice-versa   Tom aka Boston Tom  â Another decent Boston fella. Heâs great at killing loneliness and, whatâs more, he sings. He sings and plays guitar [thatâs right, Christian]. We hang out from time to time. Heâs one of the only people Iâve met independent of Sean.   Colin  â Yet another decent Boston fella. Heâs normally the guy Iâm out to lunch with when my away message says âout to lunchâ or something to that effect. He usually comes equipped with a bunch of jokes and stories â good times. The only only person I've met independant of Sean.   Woodyâs Lady  â The bartender at Woodyâsâ¦ she doles out Pabst like it was penicillin. Sheâs a big Ray Bradbury as well (among other authors) so we have a lot to talk about. Hail to thee, Giver of Pabst!   The Heckling Bum  â Believe it or not, near the NEC, thereâs an angry bum. Donât you DARE give him pennies or [gasp!] food. He will seriously bitch you out and, if youâre particularly unlucky, heâll throw your donation back in your face. He yells at passersby who donât give him the change he craves and, I recently found out, he lives  in a better apartment than I do . Sheesh.   Abby  â My preeecioussssssssâ¦ [my guitar]    So thatâs that. Those are all the main characters that make their way into my posts from time to time. Now â how about the past two daysâ¦    7.06.2004   Ouchâ¦ ouch ouch ouch ouch ouch ouch ouch ouch ouch ouch ouch ouch ouch ouchâ¦  My poor bodyâ¦ the parades have done evil things to my body. I was so sore â sweet Jesus.  Aside from that, not much else happened. I used my day the only way I knew howâ¦ sleepingâ¦ hard.   7.07.2004   [see  7.06.2004 ] Add in lunch with Tom and, beside that, I had another long, uneventful, and somewhat restful day. Hopefully tomorrow will be a touch more exciting. Meantime, Iâm gonna make the most of the rest of my day by doing absolutely nothing at all.  Ciao for nowâ¦"
378516,1510754,2004-07-08,So I'll make this short and sweet...  Sasquatch is here.   [trouble!]  ...  [news @ 11]
378517,1510754,2004-07-15,"I'm beginning to realize that posting every single day may not be possible. In fact it's downright impossible sometimes. I'm just far to distracted, tired, hungry, etc. So that's that. I'll ask my regular readers to forgive me...   Moving on...  This past week was fairly interesting. Sasquatch's visit was nothing short of awesome. We wandered arounf the city taking in the sights, lunching, sipping at beer, and lounging in the apartment playing video games and generally reliving the good ol' ""Squatch 'n' Dexter"" days. The last night of this two day odyssey, we went to a jam session at the apartment of a mutual friend of Sean and myself a few blocks away. There we found a table laden with goodies and a bucket full of beer. People-wise, there were a number of eager musicians including 2 bass players, a drummer, a DJ, 2 vocalists, a guitarist, and a keyboard player.  We jammed the night away...  I haven't had that much fun in a jam session in quite a long time.  The next morning, it was time for Sasquatch to leave and, after a few days of contemplation, I decided to join him. Down in CT, my friends were throwing the 2nd annual Bastille Day Party.  This is, of course, where things went wrong.  I showed up with Scotty (recently freed from camp) to find several old friends, good food, decent beer, and bucket â a concoction with a rich history [read: sinister Jack Danielâs based masterpiece]  Partying ensued. Drunkenness followed. I injured my spine. Hereâs what happened.  At some point near or after midnight, Eric Bell and I decided that it would be a good idea to start wrestling. This madness, peppered with drunken laughter and embraces, went on for far too long. At one point, the lady of the house broke out the garden hose and sprayed us down. I got a decent portion of it straight up my nose.  Wonderful.  When the dust [mud] settled, Eric and I were pathetic, mud covered, grass stained, good time party boy bastards and the rest of the Bastille Day bunch were peeved to say the least. So be it. Our fun was done. At 3 AM, Scotty drove a drunk and bruised me back to his place where I promptly fell asleep on his carpet. I woke up without pants [?] and Scotty loaned me some dry clothes. Sasquatch and Dobbs picked me up and ferried me back to Tolland.  [whew!] I spent the next few days as a sore puppy on the couch.  During these days, I was trounced several times in some fairly gruesome chess matches by my good friend Ed. It was awful.  And then, one day, this happened:   Yahoo! Chess Game   White:  Drew  Black:  Ed  Irony:  [pathetic]  Date:  Thursday July 15 2004  1. e2-e4 e7-e5 2. f2-f3 d7-d5 3. d2-d3 d5xe4 4. f3xe4 g8-f6 5. g1-f3 c8-g4 6. b1-d2 b8-c6 7. d2-c4 g4xf3 8. g2xf3 f8-c5 9. c1-e3 c5xe3 10. c4xe3 c6-d4 11. f1-e2 d8-d7 12. d1-d2 o-o-o 13. d2-b4 c8-b8 14. c2-c3 d4-c6 15. b4-b3 f6-h5 16. e3-d5 f7-f5 17. d3-d4 e5xd4 18. e2-a6 b7-b6 19. d5xb6 a7xb6 20. c3-c4 f5xe4 21. c4-c5 e4xf3 22. o-o-o f3-f2 23. c5xb6 c7xb6 24. b3xb6+ b8-a8 25. h1-f1 d8-b8 26. b6-c5 h5-f6 27. c5-a3 f6-e4 28. a6-b5+ a8-b7 29. a3-a6+ b7-c7 30. d1xd4 d7xd4 31. a6xc6+ c7-d8 32. f1-d1 e4-d2 33. d1xd2 f2-f1+ 34. b5xf1 b8-c8 35. d2xd4+ d8-e7 36. d4-e4+ e7-f7 37. f1-c4+ f7-f8 38. c6-d6++   In other words, I kicked ass. This is possible the best game Iâve ever played.  And now? â Iâm off to Maryland. I was hired by a company called ""BestEnglishSpanish"" to redo their website â it is an out and out nightmare. Phone and internet conversation were useless as far as resolving the problem goes and my boss invited me down to Maryland to meet with him and work all this out in person. Who knows? â This may be the start of something good.  One thing is for sureâ¦ I made good on my promise of a summer to remember.  After Maryland itâs back to CT for a Frankpiping good time [3 day retreat] followed by several days of performances.  Iâll update when I can â life sure isnât making it easy.  Until next I blog..."
378518,1510754,2004-07-25,"ok ok ok... I know... long time no post...  This time, however, there was good reason. I've just landed after a week [+] worth of adventures. I'll explain...  My boss kinda screwed me.   My boss is a great guy.  Here's how that works.  I didn't have to worry about food or anything like that when I was down there - he even made me megagigantic steak burgers. Seriously these things were bigger than your creepy uncle's drinking problem - we're talkin' HUGE. Conversely, we had agreed that I'd make about 10 bucks an hour on this trial gig and, though I made a fair amount, the agreed upon pay rate was never to be. All told, I spent close to 70 hours on that web site. I got paid 200 bucks. You do the math. I'm not upset, mind you - I had a great time and, hell, I wouldn't have been doing much else during that time anyway. I do feel cheated but so be it. It's no big loss.  Before treking back to Boston, my boss and I grabbed some stuff from his apartment - laptop, clothes, etc. He was driving me back and then heading over to Long Island. While he packed, I occasionally brought some things out to the car. Once that was all over, I sat on the couch and tried to keep myself occupied. Looking up, I noticed to police officers outside of the door. I also noticed their standard issue firearms pointed in my direction.  [expletive!]  Oh... and did I mention? My boss is an astonomy buff and has all kinds of cool telescopes and such all over his apartment. When I saw the cops, I had a small telescope in my hands; a long metallic tube that could have easily been mistaken for a weapon - namely a firearm.  (Thank God we weren't in [clan] Manchester)  I dropped the telescope and put my hands up. I was about 80% certain that I was going to be shot and, honestly, it felt kinda cool. I imagined the sound, the pain, the scar, and, most importantly, what an  awesome  story I'd have afterwords. I shifted slightly in my seat in a vain attempt to position myself in such a way as to minimize damage to my favorite organs. My boss came out of his room just in time and walked over to the door and TADA!, saw some cops just itching to put a hole in something. He went outside and they disappeared behind a corner leaving me to make water in my pants on the couch in this suddenly hostile town.  Everything was cool.  What happened? - Well it turns out that my boss was supposed to be in Mexico for two more weeks and his neighbors didn't know that he had come back early. They look out of their windows to see a black man carrying things out of his apartment with him nowhere in sight [Mexico by their understanding]. They called the cops who showed up in John Wayne mode; guns blazin' and lookin' fer tha bad feller. So that's that. The cops went away [presumably disappointed at not having been given a reason to discharge their weapons - specifically  into  someone] and I finally put my hands down feeling somewhat dejected. I should have been shot.   It would have been awesome.  Anyway, disaster averted, we hopped into the car for the 6.5 hour ride to Boston.  ... ... ... ... ... ...   10 hours later , we crossed into CT. We had left Maryland at 2:30pm. It was past 1am when we finally got to Boston.   I hate cars forever.  The next morning, I woke up and, heh, it was time to leave again. After a rough night of sleep in my apartment, I grabbed my crap [there had been no need to unpack] and headed out again - this time to Glastonbury for the  urlLink Frankpipe  retreat and a week of pipey goodness. We all met up at Tom's [see  urlLink cast of characters ] place and, for the next bajillion hours, we rehearsed. Don't get me wrong, it  was  frustrating but we got a lot accomplished. Satisfied, we grabbed a room at the Hilton to relax before bedding down for the night.  Tae-Bo happened.  It's not what you think.  Perhaps this advice will suffice:  A rock band in a hotel is like a child molestor at a day care center - you'd be a  fool  not to expect something to go horribly wrong.   The details really aren't important [though I can hear your jaws smacking and watering for details]. We rocked. We slept soundly. I snored like a rape victim.  The next day, we rocked the farmer's market in Hartford. It really was that simple.  We had to [censor] ourselves so much of the time, we felt constricted. Nonetheless, we rocked out and our fans were pleased. We even got it on tape [video and plain audio] so keep your eyes and ears out for that one sometime in the future.  After that gig, we packed up and went our seperate ways. I hung out at Tom's for a few days and went swimming in Cotton Hollow - a creek nestled deep in the woods of Glastonbury. I also rocked out HARD on some  urlLink Mario Sunshine  [availible on Game Cube] and generally enjoyed time with Tom's family [saints all around].  After a few days at Chez Tommy, we headed over to Upton, Mass for a gig.  Again we rocked... harder... Jesus.  Despite the 40 billion to 1 human to mosquito ratio, we kicked ass. That night, I slept at Jomo's place [see  urlLink cast of characters ]. The following night, we were to rock out at the  urlLink Middle East Club  in Cambridge, Mass. Joy. After a night at Chez Jomo, it was off to Boston to prepare for the apex of our now week long rock-a-thon.  ...  I've never rocked harder in my whole life - ever.  Best damn rock show period.  I am not leaving Boston.    We showed up for a 7pm sound check at 6:15 or so and, surprise, 7pm came and we weren't up for a sound check. 7:45ish we finally hit the stage for a soundcheck and we learn something pretty valuable about ourselves right away. We're damn loud. Christ. The sound guy had a face on that looked like he had seen pictures of his mother pleasuring herself with his toothbrush. After s rough few minutes, we worked out a fairly decent sound and hopped of stage. The opening band never showed up [awesome] and so we were pushed up on the list. That was fine... except 9pm came around and the house was still empty. Not... one... guest... period.  [gulp]  9:30? - Same deal and, according to the sound guy [and our original playing slot] we had to go on at 9:40... though neither the band nor the club staff were cool with the idea.  Whatever.  The band, undaunted, headed outside and tried to drum up an audience. We broke out into an improvised a capella medlely of all our songs and got a fair amount of onlookers/temporary fans but not a single person went into the club. [damn it!]. We still were in high spirits and decided to head in and play anyway - empty house be damned.  [If you rock out, they will come]  People immediatly began coming in the instant we began our set. How 'bout that, eh? The house actually got quite full and, damn it, the crowd was digging us. The even started singing along! And the band? We rocked harder than a priest at a boyscout camp.  [word]  You had to have been there - I won't waste your time trying to describe it to you. Suffice it to say it was one of the best shows of my life to date. I'm STILL buzzing from that show.  And this week?  Well... job hunting - I'm at the end of my cash [surprise] and have no real immediate prospects of getting more for a while so it's time to buckle down and brace for missing a meal or two. So be it! - All for the love of the city.  When I'm a rockstar, I won't ever have these problems...   [ Z  Z   Z  Z Z  rockstar ...]"
378519,1510754,2004-08-06,"I know... I know...  I'm getting worse. Almost 2 whole weeks without an update.  There's just so much going on lately...  [fade to apt. interior 12 days prior]  Immediatly following the  urlLink T.T. Bear's gig , I went over to Goodchild's place [ urlLink see cast of characters ] and well... we got rocked. We spoke of many things. Nobody was hurt. I stumbled from Goodchild's several hours later sometime after midnight through the alley behind his apartment leaving my trombone behind. The world was a giant Labyrinth puzzle and I was the steel ball.  I slept like a pre-op heart patient.  The following week was quite the blur. We were so excited about what had gone down at T.T.'s and were ready to play again - possibly another impromtu concert in Harvard Square. Our forces were divided, however. Over the course of that week at some point, Tom was in New Hampshire, Mike was in New York, Dave was in New York, Sean was in Maine, Jomo was [insert destination], and I was in my apartment. Being relatively isolated gave me plenty of time to rework a number of things on the  urlLink Frankpipe website ... which, of course, I did.  I can see some of you thanking me for not updating this blog during that time and, well, you're weclome. It was a tedious and personally exciting time but I doubt I could manage to convery that what with my clumsy command of the language.  But trust me... it was awesome :)  So that was it during that week... and then the weekend came.  [feet shuffling]  umm... I had a date.  [covering ears]  I can hear all my gal pals shrieking and cheering and whatnot. Please - it's not that big a deal. I prefer not to talk about it here - ask me over IM or in person. It was nice. And yes, Em, I managed to keep all of my clothes on AND I kept my hands to myself - lol. Anyway, as soon as I got back from the date, Henry was here.  Henry is a HUGE italian guy I met at a bar in Hartford some years back. Good friend of mine and, thankfully, most of the time, he's working. I mean literally  most of the time  - a 16-20 day is no big deal to him - construction work is to Henry as music is to Drew. But when he's finally free for a day or two, he wants to party. And it always [always!] means danger for me. This time he showed up at my door with a little black bag and a six beer headstart. I sucked it up, threw his bag in my apt, and we headed out to cause trouble.  I was reminded of my early days at UConn and Shag.  It's important to put Henry's size into perspective. 6'5"" 250 or so... solid muscle vs my 5'11"" 150 wirey geek frame . Oh... and he expects me to keep up shot for shot and beer for beer. Which is, and always will be, a formula for trouble.  So off we go... and I can tell you for sure that we started off at  urlLink Dick's Last Resort .  [note: for those of you who experienced the 'magic' with me in that wonderful San Antonio bar, I'd like to say that, yes, there is one in Boston and, yes, it's just as awesome - join me!]  After that, things get hazy. I did, however, learn 3 things...  ...unfortunatlly I can only recall the most important one:   Never give Henry tequilla.   I can here some of you laughing. I've heard similar decrees given by other folk but this is the very first time I've seen it pan out to something... well just plain dangerous.  Since we first started hanging out, he and all the people who knew him got all kinds of quiet when the word ""tequilla"" was mentioned. I thought it was all dramatic bullshit to be honest. Nobody really wanted to talk about it but they  insisted  that I not give him tequilla.  I didn't listen. In fact, he had about 4 shots thanks to me...  ...ummm I'm pretty sure he punched a guy out.  We fled the scene and grabbed a cab to some other place that was not my home [?]. We walked from that place to my apartment whereupon Henry collapsed on my bed.  Great.  I stole my blankets, curled up on the couch, and was asleep in seconds.  The morning came and, per usual, I was up at the crack of dawn. After checking my mail, brushing my teeth and washing my face, I drop kicked Henry and we headed off to The Pour House on Boylston for the best breakfast on earth. Seriously. The prices are wicked cheap [$4 for french toast and sasuage] and the food is excellent. Stuffed, we headed back to the apartment and [shock and surprise] Henry was alseep  again  in less than 10 min [Hungover much?]. About 3 hours later, he got up, packed his things, and headed off to a job in Attleboro or some place.  Good times.  I spent the rest of the day sleeping in my bed. I don't know what the hell I was trying to prove but it felt damn good.  The next day, things started happening all at once.  Over the course of this week, we [Frankpipe] got a number of emails and IM's from fans in Washington State. Apparently we have a whole lot of fans out there. Seriously. They want us to come out there to do a show. We're considering a roadtrip.  The band all came back to Boston - well except Tom who is still in CT with family. We've met in different chunks and worked on some new music here and there. Mike has written 4 new songs [jesus]. Goodchild and I are collaborating on one.  Pictures from 2 of our last 3 gigs [Farmer's Market (Hartford, CT) and T.T. The Bear's Place (Cambridge, MA)] came in. The T.T.'s shots were a little dark and tough to make use of but the Farmer's Market shots were excellent. They're  urlLink posted here on our website .  This weekend's show at  urlLink Donstock  was confirmed. Nick Amodio's band  urlLink Pachadio  may be playing as well. $4 people - IM me for more details.  I updated the crap out of the website - please,  urlLink sign up for the mailing list . Really. You'll know all there is to know as soon as we do. Plus there will be chances to win free crap! Sweet! Pictures, video, and mp3's abound.  urlLink Check it out .  That's been my week. Web geekery, Frankpipery, and such.   I hope I never leave this town.  This summer is almost over and the reality of  home v boston  is starting to sink in. In my heart I've made my choice and now, I guess, it's time to start making real life preperations.  We'll see what comes of all of this. Either way it's been a helluva ride thus far, eh? :)  And Hey! Don't be afraid to drop an IM or an email from time to time gang. I miss you guys.  Even Rockstars get lonely.   Frankly,  Dexter"
391165,1190695,2004-05-24,"Let's just say I hardly expected to be talking about religion (not matter how indirectly) on my second entry, but such is the world we live in. To set the stage, I'd like to entertain you with a little anecdote:  So the greatest guy in the world - for ambiguity's sake, let's call him ""Adrian"" - is playing Counter-Strike online one Victoria Day afternoon when a certain individual - who, for ambiguity's sake, we will call ""Priscilla"" - hiding behind the anonymity of the Internet, signs onto the server Adrian is playing in and changes his screenname to ""i fight for allah"". Adrian, being such a smart guy, corrects Priscilla, saying Allah is, in fact, spelt with a capital 'A'. To which Priscilla responds, ""allah is not my god, so i choose not to capitalize it."" Adrian is struck upside the head by this comment, and as a result, ceases to refer to himself in the third-person.  Yes, folks, believe it or not, ""Allah"" is a proper noun, and as such should be spelt with a capital 'A'. Priscilla's comment is the equivalent of saying ""George Bush isn't my president, so I'm not going to capitalize his name"" or ""I don't drive a Ford, so from now on it will be known as 'mustang'"".   Even so, the word ""Allah"" isn't specific to Islam; it's the Arabic word for ""God"". Even Arabic Christians and Jews call God ""Allah"". So, unless Priscilla does not believe in any higher being, Allah  is  technically Priscilla's god.  Ah, but what can one do? Much to my chagrin, I can't spend more than thirty seconds online without coming across this sort of garbage. As a result, I try not to talk much while playing Counter-Strike.  So what does our petulant protagonist do? He proceeds to make Priscilla eat hot lead, four rounds straight. Doesn't that make you feel all warm and fuzzy inside?  The End."
391166,1190695,2004-05-22,"Yes, this is it. Much to the delight of all connected to the Internet, if not the world, I have decided to start my very own online blog. There shall be rejoicing in the streets! Drinks are on me.  Sarcasm aside, I feel this will be an interesting experience. It's hard to pinpoint my reasons for choosing to publishing my deepest, most personal thoughts only for the world to see. The man living in my right auditory canal, but we'll leave that subject alone for the time being. No, let's focus on a couple succinct, less personal reasons:  1) Being a self-professed geek and technophile, I figure I should have some semblance of a web site, lest my PDA reject my body and eat its way through my pocket, thereby ruining a perfectly good pair of pants. In my history online, I have started exactly three personal web sites, and have finished exactly zero. Let us pray this one will live long enough to catch interest in online communities, making yours truly an Internet sensation overnight. One can dream.  2) A few of my good friends, both online and in that frightening void know as the Real World, have similar online journals. I have yet to come across a trend more worthy of my endorsement.  3) My mind is a raging sea of useless knowledge and half-finished thoughts. Hear that gurgling sound? Could just be the three-day-old leftover Kentucky Fried Chicken using my stomach as a medium to communicate with the living world, but let's not go there. Anyway, I feel I should have a place to write down some of the things that spew forth from my cerebral cortex on an hourly basis.  4) Being at the height of my teenage years, I feel it may be time to indulge in a little navel-gazing and soul-searching. Therefore, during the lifespan of this blog, I will successfully deduce no less than the answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything. You can take my word for it.  Having seen this, I'm guessing that this blog will end up being some odd combination of  urlLink Slashdot  and  The Catcher in the Rye . Nevertheless, a good time will be had by all. I hope I will be able to find the time to stop by and update regularly.  I can see that nearly an hour has passed since I started this composition. The Internet and instant messaging services are indeed powerful forces of distraction. And unwatched episodes of  24  are calling. 'Night."
391167,1190695,2004-06-09,"According to  urlLink this article , there's a Rainbow Six motion picture in the works. Of course, my first thought was, ""it's about freakin' time"".  Then I noticed that John Woo will be directing the film. I don't think I've ever gone from overdrive to reverse so quickly. John, stick to Hong Kong shoot-em-up action flicks. That's what you're good at. The Rainbow Six name is neither about slick gunplay nor fancy camera angles.   But who knows? Maybe he'll pull it off. If not, we'll have another  Mission: Impossible 2  on our hands."
391168,1190695,2004-06-08,"I'm in the process of discovering that it's  really  not easy to find time to update this blog. It seems that new posts have become a weekly occurrence. Hopefully once exams are over in a couple of weeks I'll be able to get on here more frequently. In the meantime, let's go over the past week, in insufferable detail, replete with witty idioms and colloquialisms! I'm quivering just thinking about it!   Wednesday:  Uh, Wednesday. Wednesday... Hmmmm. Must not have been an overly interesting day if I can't remember a thing about it. According to my PDA, I had a math test and the last day of my Accounting summative, but I'll be damned if I can remember. I  do  know my team managed to blow the two-goal lead we had going into the second half. End result: 2-2. No, I didn't score, but at least I didn't have to rip a loose flap of skin off my heel again. Moving on...   Thursday:  Thursday was quite an eventful day, comparatively. My mom finally dragged me across town to the licencing center to get my G1 (""learner's permit"", to all the less enlightened out there). Some forms, an eye test, and 40 multiple-choice questions later, and I can now drive! I'm free as a bird! A bird who has to fly with 0.0% blood-alcohol level, an adult with at least four-years flying experience in the passenger seat, an only between one half-hour before sunrise to one half-hour after sunset. But I digress.  It's not that I don't  want  to drive. It's just that I have no  motivation  to start. I'm not going to have my own car, or have regular access to one, and as soon as I pass my road test, I'll be relegated to the position of ""taxi driver"" for my little sister. Add $600 for driver's ed. and the early onset of grey hair thanks to having to drive with my dad, and the whole thing just didn't seem worth it. Ah, well, things are now in motion.  After working at the library from 3:30-5:30, I got  the  best exercise I've had in months. Certainly felt like it anyway. It seems the Powers That Be decided to have me referee a 14-year-old boys' game way up at Notre Dame High School in north Burlington. Of course, my dad is out of town, and my mom has to work, leaving me stuck with a bicycle as my only means of transportation to said game. Of course, the route I have to take it  uphill , into a headwind, for about 2km. Needless to say, I was puttering along on my grannie gear for most of the trip. Truth be told, though, I'm not in the best shape. On the other hand, coming home was a blast: I'm sure I hit a good 50 clicks going downhill.   Friday:  Friday, hmmmm... Friday. A lot like Wednesday. Got my math test back (aced it), did a Cisco practical exam (aced it), had to work at the soccer club from 6-9. That's just about it.   Saturday:  Six hour shifts at the soccer club are  not  fun. Especially now that the season has started and there's really nothing to do but surf the Internet, random odd job exclusive. So after working 9-3 I came home and... slept? Did homework? Played  Morrowind  for four hours? Your guess is as good as mine. This is why I need to update more often.   Sunday:  Sunday morning I got up and no one was home. It was a nice day, so I went for a walk... and bought a new  urlLink mouse . It was on sale, what can I say? This is why I shouldn't go for walks very often: I always end up buying something. I highly recommend the mouse, by the way.   Monday:  Let's run through this quickly - My Computer Engineering class managed to talk my teacher into letting us write our summative test on Wednesday instead. I say to them, why bother? You're not going to be ready then, either.  - Learned about alkenes in Chemistry. Whee!  - Hung around in Physics class longer than I had to. Double whee!  - Worked at the library 6-9  - Came home and watched the Flames lose the Stanley Cup. While studying for a Cisco exam. Right, ""studying"".   Tuesday:  That's today, so hopefully I'll be able to remember  something . Wrote my Cisco exam, and got 85%. Pretty good, considering it was on chapters 1-14, and we've only covered 1-8. During lunch I crammed for the Computer Science summative test I had to write last period. After getting out of Accounting early, I went down to the cafeteria to pick up my yearbook, sign a couple others, and participate in some rousing games of euchre. Math class consisted of more yearbooks signing. What do you expect for the second-last day of school? Anyway, the Comp. Sci. test was a breeze, so I was able to go home a bit early.  Which brings us to the here and now. Wasn't that fun?   Now, I must go suffer through another three hours at the soccer club. Ciao!"
391169,1190695,2004-06-01,"With the end of school looming on the horizon, it's hard to find time to check my email these days, much less update a blog. Today's topic is: Random Things That Have Popped Into My Head In The Past Few Days.  1) When browsing through the CD collection at your local public library, please reseat all of the CDs you have flipped forward. It will save the library staff muchos pesos on Advil.  2) Don't you hate it when you accidentally drop something, make an amazing diving/rolling/what-have-you catch, and no one is around to see it?  3)  urlLink Luigi's Conjecture . What a brilliant idea. I must test this newfound theory over the next couple of weeks. Kudos, Scratchy.  Subconsciousness calls, so that is all for now. Until next time!"
391170,1190695,2004-07-28,"In case anybody was wondering, I've been in British Columbia for the past 12 days. It seems I forgot to tell most people, as John called me on my cell phone while I was driving through Revelstoke, BC, on the way to Canmore, Alberta.    Our trip took us through Salmon Arm, BC, to Canmore, Alberta, which is very close to Banff and Banff National Park (read: mountains). Then back to Kelowna, BC, for a couple of days before returning to Vancouver and Surrey to schmooze with the relatives. I'll compose a travelogue over the next couple of days, complete with pictures (I snapped almost a full 256MB SD card full of them).    I'll leave you with a tune by the Arrogant Worms:    'Cause we've got  Rocks and trees  And trees and rocks  And rocks and trees   And trees and rocks  And rocks and trees  And trees and rocks  And rocks and trees  And trees and rocks  And water!     All right, everyone!"
391171,1190695,2004-07-04,"...and I don't know why. I played billiards for a couple of hours this afternoon, but surely that isn't too strenuous an exercise... Maybe I'm coming down with something.  Anyway, it's been nearly a month since I last posted here. And unfortunately, due to the current unsteady nature of my extremities, I'll have to cut this one short. Perhaps I'll be back tomorrow, after a good night's sleep.   I'm off to watch the Euro 2004 final that my father conveniently taped for me. I'll leave you with this thought-provoking quote:  ""I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones."" -Albert Einstein  Tot volgende tijd!"
394243,2422596,2004-06-16,"Went riding yesterday, as usual. The stable the school horses are stabled in is being renovated, so most of them were in temporary boxes in the yard. Mekur really loved that. He only had one neighbour, Kingston, and he had of cause more space around him. He was much happier when I saddled him, and much fresher in the arena. Very very nice. He did want to have fun, and was testing me a bit when I started, but then it went really well. I enjoy riding him more and more, and I have even considered trying to strike a deal with Gunilla (daily leader of both the stable and the riding school) and his owner if I could ride a set amount of time each week, only having instruction some of the times. But I need to finish my thesis first and figure out how to do it in the afternoon/evening, since I'm sure I'll get a job right away :).  I want to ride some more. More, please more!"
394244,2422596,2004-06-13,"For the EU Parliament. Doing my civic duty and all.   Also, I have  finally  come up with who I wanted in the role of Helen in Troy.  urlLink Aishwarya Rai ! (Not official site, btw.) She is one of the most beautiful women in the world, I think. I know she is and looks Indian, but she is not very dark, the Greek were dark and not fair skinned. Also, in the movie we did not get to know who were her parents or her backstory, so an exotic touch might have been a possible explanation for her beauty.   Also, went roleplaying today, we got a 3rd player, nice, but Pelle unfortunately couldn't today, so we were still only two players. Went nicely though, except we could a little healing. Oh and with the ever twisting plot, I'm afraid we really screwed up..."
394245,2422596,2004-06-09,"Yesterday we had our monthly Zonta (Golden Z Club) meeting. The topic was feedback, and Ella Schumann from Zonta Roskilde were invited to speak. She has her own consulting company,  urlLink Evolution ApS .  We had a very interesting discussion covering a lot of things, mostly how and why we perceive others as we do, but also about how we interact in social situations and the borders of what is private, personal and public about us.   The main point about the feedback, that both the giver and the receiver should be conscious about what exactly they want/give feedback on. Also when you give feedback, you can only state what you perceived, you cannot tell anything about if the other person is good at what he/she generally does. That is up to the person to decide, based on what several people perceive about them.  We also talked about Jung's shadow theory, that was very interesting: About how the feedback you receive when you are a kid determines what kind of prejudices and 'boxes' you have. It also determines what feelings and behavior you show. Other feelings might be surpressed and are hiding in the shadow. This might not be 'bad' feelings, if your parents didn't want you to laugh loudly, the inclination to do so might hide in your shadow. I would like to read some more about it, but knowing me, I will probably never get around to it :)Â·  All in all a very good meeting, it made me think about some things I don't normally think about, and that is always good."
394246,2422596,2004-06-06,"Susan took a lot of pictures at Roskile Dyreskue, you can now see some of them at her  urlLink Blog  (which is up again, btw)"
394247,2422596,2004-06-06,"Friday we went and saw Troy,and we really liked it. It was actually better than I had expected, I think both Hector and Achilleus were very good, and well casted. The only problem I had was Helen, I didn't think she was beautiful enough, not that she was ugly, she was just ordinary good looking, not stunning. Also I didn't think Paris and Helen seemed like they were in love, the spark just missed. I dunno.  Oh, and I admit that Brad Pitt can look good. Yeah... Apparently they whole bronzed, oily, muscled thing works for him...  Today (or yesterday actually) Susan and a riding buddy of ours, Marianne, and I went to  urlLink Roskilde Dyreskue . We saw a lot of horses, and a lot of different races. A Shire stallion in full gallop is a sight to see! Many pretty horses! Uhmm Friesans. We also saw lots of other animals, goats, sheep, hens and other poultry, cows, rabbits, cats, dogs...  The sun was shining, it was a wonderful Danish summers day. But we had no sunscreen with us, so we all got burnt of cause. Ouch!!  We will definitely do it again next year. With sun lotion."
394248,2422596,2004-06-01,"Was really bad. Mekur was in a very bad mood, I felt I had to push around. He tried to object, and he wanted to threaten the other horses. Very annoying. I have a lesson together with Susan on Friday, I hope that one will be better."
394249,2422596,2004-07-29,"Well, not much. Moving into the last month of our thesis, the days look pretty much like each other, writing, a bit of coding, a bit frustration, some more writing.   Except for the visit to Tisvilde to the in-laws, which was nice, my mom's birthday which was also nice. Ad Sune's (one of Christian's old philosophy mates) birthday party last Saturday, also nice. And sunny :-)!   Also, saw Susan and Jonas Monday, ate nice Thai food at the Siam Orchid, yummy. They are finally back from all their vacationing, and brought nice gifts :-). The Sprite Ice Cube does taste weird, but in a good way I think. Well, menthe works for me... Don't ask...     Well, back to writing."
394250,2422596,2004-07-19,is it raining again.     sigh.
394251,2422596,2004-07-18,"Yesterday it was finally summer. No more rain! Yay!     Christian went to the moat and sat in the sun, had icecream  :D. We also had BBQ for dinner, first time this summer...     Otherwise, Kristine and I have decided to go back to handing in our Thesis at the original date, the 30th of August. We just cannot get it done by the 13th, so now our defense will be after I get back from Canada, but that is OK."
394252,2422596,2004-07-03,"Been a while so here I go: Last Saturday we went to Laust to have a BBQ. It was very nice, it was a long time since we had seen him. Always good to talk about computer games, computers in general, studying, beer and more. The problem is that Laust doesn't drink wine, so he had of cause brought beer for us. Since I don't drink much beer, I had brought a bottle of wine with me. I got a nice wheat beer, a bottle of wine... We also went with his neighbours to the common house (in the dorm/apartment place he lives) and got a drink. We played Trivial with his neighbours also, so we weren't home until 4 am. And I was kind of drunk. But a great evening. Oh btw I got a new bike Saturday as well, as my old one is 11 years old. It is great to use.   On Sunday Susan, Corinne (an American woman riding at Mattssons, right after us and also on Mekur) and I went to the Danish Dressage Championships, which took place at Broholm Ridecenter in Fyn. I had to pick up Susan and Corinne at Lyngby station at 9 am. So I only got 4 hours of sleep, and I were a bit tired and hung over... But the Championships were very nice, there was some really excellent riding, it was great to see. Eventhough it was raining, and the seats were hard... Next year with blanket, without hangover :). You can see some very nice pictures, as well as results in  urlLink Susan's Blog .  Wednesday Christian and I went to see Harry Potter and the prisoner of Azkaban. It was really good, we both found it much better than the other Harry Potter movies. Also, it was nice that I had forgotten some of the plots, so there was a bit of suspense :). Before the movie we ate at a small diner, Kazim's Kitchen close to the movie theater ( urlLink Empire ), and he made some really good sandwiches.  Thursday Christian went to France to climb, so I took him to the airport this morning. Poor me all alone. I will survive :). He really needed to get on vacation, so I hope they have nice weather down there. He is returning on Monday the week after this.  Friday my brother and Sisse got married. Bjarke phoned me last Friday, and asked if I was doing anything this Friday, because they were getting married at the city hall in Gilleleje. I was in some kind of shock, didn't expect that. But very pleasant surprise :). It was very nice and small, only the closest family (those that weren't away on holidays). After the wedding we went to Bjarke and Sisse's house to have brunch. It was a long time since I have seen their house, they had made a lot of improvements, it is going to be so nice. The brunch was great, they had made some really delicious things, like home made Nutella! We also went for a short walk to the beach, as the weather was actually quite nice yesterday :). It was nice to meet Sisse's family, and it was a wonderful quiet wedding, and I really hope it was exactly what they wanted. I think it was :)."

Not necessarily any awkward crazy things, just things I had never done before. So far I've accomplished (in no particular order):  * went to the spa (splurged) * ate shark * went on ""maid of the mist"", Niagara Falls * got rear ended in a car accident (nothing serious)  It's a good start. Hope to still have much more stuff to add to the list."

Simple: does the translation do it justice? is the story as captivating in another language? So far, YES! Highly recommended novel by everyone that has read it.  Just a quick note: Armani Mania, also recommended to the boys out there."

Man, eeqaz you looked hot yesterday (or so that was the general consensus).  Cerellean, so did you hun, you're always hot. Work, dreaded, but unavoidable, let's go..."

418930,3351952,2004-05-19,"So, I need to improve my self-esteem.  The thing is, I don't think I have a poor image of myself at all.  I like myself.  Hey, I'm my best friend.  I know that I'm a smart person, I think I'm pretty (most of the time, sometimes you just have those days where you don't like any of your clothes or you can't get your hair done right, but we all have those), I like my body.  I have a little belly pudge, but I think just about the right amount.  If I wanted the perfect body, I would reduce the pudge by a little bit, but overall, I look good.  Anyways...  I'm a good person, I usually like everyone, I honestly can't think of a reason someone shouldn't like me.  However, both socially, and since I started grad school, academically, I just act like I have no confidence in myself.  I have a very difficult time conversing with people until I know them really well.  Even some people I've spent a good amount of time with, I just can't be comfortable in their presence.  I don't know why this is.  I'm constantly worried about what to say, and I just can't hold a normal conversation.  Also academically, which is a big issue lately, I just feel like I haven't accomplished anything in lab.  And I worry that I'm not going about my project right, and I flip out and get super nervous when I have to give presentations, to the point that I give myself diarrhea.  (Woohoo, doesn't everyone want to know all about that?!)  Ever since I got here, I just don't have faith in myself that I am going to succeed.  In college, I was really good at my major.  I didn't particularly like the field, but I got a certain amount of satisfaction from problem solving doing homework, and doing well on a test.  Even when I had to study my brains out, thinking how am I ever going to figure this out, I always did, and did well on the tests.  Here, I started out in a new field, and in the coursework first year I felt a little disadvantaged from not having all the background as it seemed like everyone else had.  But I pulled through, passed everything.  But at every step here I feel like I'm one step behind everyone else or where I should be.  You don't get the satisfaction of a test grade in research telling you that you're at least on track.  Everytime I ask people questions about my work, I feel like I'm bothering them.  When I meet with my advisor, I always feel like he expects more than what I've got.  And that he expects me to work harder and put in more hours than I am.  I would work around the clock, but sometimes I just don't know what to do. Or I have to wait for stuff I ordered to come in.  Or wait to hear back from the tech support people.  It's soo frustrating.  Anyways, I just need to plow through.  But I want to be able to feel better about it.  I really do like what I'm doing.  I just don't like feeling like a complete failure.   Anyways, as for the social problems, I've decided a lot of it is because I just hang out with people who I know through school.  Those are the only people I know in Baltimore.  So school always comes up.  Maybe I'm just intimidated because I feel like everyone else knows so much more than I do.  But hell, I'm here to learn.  And I am learning.  So why should that bother me?   I just can't relax around anyone.  I need to meet other people, but I have no idea how.  I have always had my ""little buddy"", who is whoever my closest friend is at that time in my life, who you go to parties with, meet new people with, and you can relax around new people because that person is there, and knows who you are.  But I don't have that here.  I need to learn how to get over it, relax, and just go meet some new people.  But again, where?  It's not like I can just saunter into a random bar/coffee shop/wherever, and be like ""hey, anyone in here looking for a new pal?""  I got a part-time job, thinking it would help me meet people, and I met people, who I now see at that job, but no one to actually hang out with.  It's hard trying to make friends with girls even, because you feel like you're a guy hitting on them when you're like ""hey, we should hang out sometime.""  Anyways, I need a new plan.  I've got to change something."
418931,3351952,2004-06-02,"This is what I have been doing for the past 3 years.  Well, at least the past 1 year certainly.  I took my oral exam at the end of May last year, and since then, I have just been doing lab work.  And I have accomplished pretty much nothing.  I do have more of an idea of what I want to do, but you'd think after 1 year of work, I would actually have acquired some concrete information.  However, I have not.  I have nothing.  Zero.  Zilch.  If I don't get something done this summer, I will have exactly the same poster as I did last year.  I think in that case I wouldn't put it up because it would be so pathetic.   The thing is, I don't understand how this is happening, and what I am doing wrong.  I really do try to work hard.  I just get stuck on these stupid problems that I'm sure nobody else is having.  For instance, I've been trying to get a real-time PCR assay going since about January.  Finally it looked like my primers were good, I had a kit and a protocol that worked, but oh, suddenly, I can't get my RNA isolated correctly.  Either it's not dissolving, or I have protein contamination.  Yes, having this problem might be acceptable, but not being able to fix it for 3 weeks is not.  This is my life.  One stupid problem after another that I can't figure out what in the world I'm doing wrong.   When you feel like a complete failure all the time, it's really hard to motivate yourself to keep coming in and keeping your pace up.  Because really, if I'm not going to get anything done, I might as well have a clean house, or be well rested, or getting plenty of exercise.  You'd think.   It makes me want just chuck it and start over with something else.  Get a job.  Do something and be successful.  But I don't want to give up and quit.  I have to make this work.  So maybe I'll write another post this time next year and I'll have my assay working."
421478,3952922,2004-08-17,"Movers & Shakers - The Typical Karachi Gig  By Saphiya Khan      Email this article   Roadside Romeos, classy chicks, smoke from the mouths of I-m-a-chain-smoker guys, girls clad in trademark crisp white cotton shalwars and duppattas, million kinds of ring tones in an effort just to show offs their new Nokia 8910 (while no one is on the other end of the line), a bit of maa behen ki gaaliyaan, with a sprinkle of head banging and some booty shakingâ¦ and youâve got a Karachi concert.  The Bahria gig that took place on the 9th of April was no different. Arranged by the 'Textile Institute of Pakistanâ, the concert featured Mizmaar (a.k.a. NOT Mizraab) and Strings. The show started as usual about an hour late, not that I mind as the place was air-conditioned which helped my make-up not get ruined. But the guys sitting behind seemed to mind the delay making loud comments like âAbey buhut hogaya, ab shuru ker"" and the likes.  Killing time wasnât really a problem as I was trying to check out the self proclaimed ""hunks"" and the one in ten fitted-bell-bottom-clad babes. A concert is the best place to see all sorts of such namoonas. Skinny guys wearing sleeveless shirts or Johnny Bravos with broad chests n muscles dressed in two sizes too small shirts. Who ever they were trying to impress was heavily disappointed to say the least.  The wait was definitely worth it as the performance by Mizmaar was pretty darn good. It looked like Danyal Badshah (the vocalist) was high on something. The crowd enjoyed songs like Saday Nal, Tu Jo Merey and Ghalori. Kashan (the guitarist) seemed to be in top form as well. Charlie, of Mizraab, was on drums that night and Russell offered his fair share of kicks with the bass. The sound was unexpectedly amazing and that was all that the crowd needed.  The typical guys gathering in the front of the stage was quite entertaining. Seemed like some of them had 'shake it daddy' playing in their minds. Shakin booties wasnât the only thing that caught the eye, the guys head banging were pretty freaky too.   Strings made their appearance soon after Mizmaarâs exit and the crowd was in awe. This time even the girls didn't try to restrain themselves and hopped in to dance at the front of the stage. Which was, of course, much to the guysâ delight.  The rhythmic claps and one step moves all seemed, well, nice. The wet macho men got some time to catch their breaths and dry their sweats (I am not exactly complaining about the smell but a bit of air freshener would have done some good). The audience hummed all the songs through out and the ones in front danced their heads off to songs like Chhaye Chhaye and Dhaani.  But of course, not all can go so well. After all it is a Karachi concert. Something seemed terribly out of place â it was all too perfect till now. And right then a little fuss was created when the dhakam peel began in the front rows. Our efficient security heroes jumped in and solved the matters by answering swears with swears, pushes with pushes and glares with bigger glares! The fuss soon ended and the heroes left with the 'sub set hai na?' Talk about efficiency.  Despite a few hiccups the gig was a good one. And those of you who missed it, kind of missed a lot. So watch out for your ""not-my-type"" bandsâ¦ they might just be as rocking as the others....and oh, if the guy with the ""unf**k the world"" t-shirt is reading this, I must say that it was a nice way of grabbing attention... *giggle giggle*"
421479,3952922,2004-08-17,"Junoon_____over the years 1991 saw the birth of a new Pakistani band,Junoon.Only this time the birth was different.Junoon wasn't just another band, it was 'the' band. I wouldn't be exaggerating if I called them a 'revolutionary' band. They entered the mainstream at the time when jhankar ruled, hideous rip-offs such as baby-yeah(remember sajjad ali?) were super hits and the word 'rock' was alien to 90% of our population. They are indeed the pioneers of Pakistani rock. While mummy daddies refused to recognize junoon's efforts as 'music', a larger part of the youth embraced junoonism. To them junoon was a passion that became more intense with each album. Although its roots lie in Pakistan, Junoon has enjoyed fame and success all over the world, courtesy the international music channels such as V and MTV that pampered it every now and then. The band was successful enough to create a new genre in Pakistan, the Sufi rock. With music inspired by Jimmy Hendrix, Jeff Black, Led Zeppelin and U2 and lyrics of great mystic poets such as Bulley Shah, Rumi, Ghalib and Iqbal, Junoon created a fusion that rocked the nation. (And a lot of other stuff too*wink*) Junoon's music is not categorized. It covered a wide range of topics in its music, from politics to the rise and fall of the taliban; they spoke up for all in their songs. Their bluntness and boldness added to their charms. They mustered up the guts in the time where media was anything but 'free'. The band began their work in 1990, when it comprised of Ali Azmat as the vocalist,Salman Ahmed the acoustic and electrical guitarist cum back up vocalist and Nusrat Hussain on the bass guitar. Their first album, Junoon, did not manage to hit the skies. It was highly criticized on, which isn't anything out of the blues for a new set up in Pakistan. It takes some time for us to get over the past and move on with something new all the time isn't it? The album Junoon, nonetheless, had some amazing tracks that were recognized in the later years such as Heer, Neend ati nahi and Rangoon main khoya. The negative response did not make Junoon lose all hopes. A year later, after bidding farewell to Nusrat Hussain and welcoming Brian o Connell as the bass guitarist, Junoon came up with their second album 'Talaash', a truck and roll album which funny to think was sponsored by close up. It was Brian's first album but his finesse didn't come until the third album, Inquilaab, released in 1995.Inquilab was no doubt the strongest pillar for Junoon.It proved their strength and rocked the Paki music scene with the smashing hit such as Husan waloon, Khwaab, Heeray and Saeein.Junoon was now a stable hit in Pakistan. In 1996 the cricket world cup saw a rise of a patriotic song ""Jazba Junoon"" that became an instant hit with the already crazed stalker cricket fans. The sales of their album, soared high and now their fan following included people of all ages, not just teeny boppers. The video for their religious devotion based song, Saeen managed to change the opinions of many critics including the country's so-called mullahs. The fifth album came out in 1997.Named Kashmakash, it again hit the top charts but this surely wasn't the best there was to Junoon.The band broke all previous records and entered the international market when their album ""Azadi"" was released. The head banging, typical rock style was so in, it gave all parents the freaks yet nothing could stop the growing fame of Junoon.Songs such as Khudi, Meree awaz sunoo and Yar bina were widely acclaimed and junoon became a household name. Junoon received  appreciation and acknowledgement even from the neighboring India, which was incredible, keeping in view the relations of the two countries at that time. The band won a golden disc for Azaadi at an international music channel awards after sharing the stage with top class international bands such as Pearl Jam, Oasis, Bush and the likes.  Their video for the song ""ehtesaab"" focused on our corrupt politicians and was ,as expected, banned from our local TV stations. The then P.M of Pakistan, Nawaz Sharif, banned the band claiming it was due to the promotion of jeans and long hair in Pakistani culture but it was a widely known fact that the ban was inflicted since Junoon refused to sing for his ""karz utaro mulk sawaro' scheme and did the song ""ehtesaab"" with imran khan instead. The ban did not dampen their spirits, Junoon carried on with their promotion for peace. The band maintained a consistent ethical rectitude. Record sales were the highest for Azadi and it remains to be the king of all albums. The next album Parvaaz was by far superior to anything junoon had ever made. The production was flawless and the album had a complete theme and songs that seem liked they belonged. Plus it had ghoom, the epic. The song that had single-handedly defined junoon's greatness. Too bad the album did not do well in India. That got Junoon wondering what the hell happened and ever since they are clutching to the old fame which is somewhat fading away. The Pakistani music scene has gone much mature in the past 13 years and the audience has a vast choice now. With innumerable bands sailing in the sea, Junoon has a lot more competiton. Their next albums did not carry out the old charm and failed to impress the Junoonis. No wonder there were so many converts from 'junoonism'.Junoon's music now is more commercial than ever and now with the different directions and ali azmat's solo tracks out, there is not much doubt left about the 'stability' of the band. Their latest album deewar was no help to the falling repute and fame of the band, instead it made the fall deeper and with a louder 'thud'. Everything aside, Junoon has made its name written in gold in the Pakistani music history. With over 20 million records selling world wide, the band did play their fair share in making Pakistan proud. Many of us Junoonis have grown up with Junoon's music. It has been a part of us for over 13 years and it is no wonder we feel a sense of loyalty towards the band. We do miss 'our' junoon, the one that lacked commercialism. Every Junooni has a Junoon moment, and in return Junoon has a song for every situation in our life. There is a fondness for Junoon in our hearts for it has been with us for long. Funny how their music inspired us and changed our lives yet we never got to thank them. So here I do it finally, All hail to Junoon, for being what they are and for playing their part in our lives. And of course, for also making us realize there is more to âmusicâ than some do dee daa crap. Junoon rocks!!!"
421480,3952922,2004-08-17,"The Ali Brothers                               Before I began my ""flip-search"" through the channels at mid night, I predicted to myself there would be noori with a doo dee daa song on IM, a few porn movies on the ""night-time-only"" channels my cable wala puts on, some old pushtu movie on UNI TV (wtf?)  And some never ending glamour filled Indian drama on star plus among my options to watch. But never in my wildest dreams did I imagine seeing the ""ali brothers"" on PTV nighttime transmission. *Sigh* Wasnât IM requested and Alizeh's favorite enough???? Why I took the pain to watch them for three full hours, you ask? Well, I couldnât really miss the perfect combination of the guests and hosts. I mean, many of us would dread facing our ex's but doing that on national TV??? Ha ha...that's gotta be interesting...yes, along with Noor and Nadia was the humpy jumpy longhaired beauty (?) Mandana zaidi...for those of you who donât know her.... sheâs the same gal seen in all noori videos.... the one who tries high kicking in ""tum hans diyeyâ. And was recently seen in jawad Ahmed's new song, tak dhina din. Oh and most importantly ,she happens to be his ex too. *sigh* The show started with the three hosts and the two guests striving to make a conversation. Mandana kept her eyes fixed on her hands. Even when she did speak, the words she used were âaap, jee, bolienââ¦ ali noor and ali hamza kept running their hands in their thick hair.... the kind any girl wud kill for. Thank God they arenât 100% girls.... I wud die if any girl besides me had that hair. A while later they acquired a mischievous tone, which didnât fail to produce sly smiles on Mandanaâs face. During the show, a few calls were placed to the Ali brothersâ family and friends and when Mandana called their parents âuncle and auntieâ and they replied with âtumâ, all doubts in my mind were cleared. The show continued with Ali Noor blabbing endlessly. He even dissed Mandana twice. Ali Hamza backed him up with his occasional âHun-Haanâ. He sang his unreleased tracks âMerey kakya kiâ and âgawal mandiâ(thatâs so unfair for BC, ainnit? *winks*) Yawning, I decided to switch the TV off but just then the phone calls were taken on air and finally the âfunâ part was here. There was a usual attack of the noorites at first, who seem to jump out of the receivers. Ali Hamza was receiving loads of requests to sing a song again but Ali Noor (read: the conceited one), sang manwa rey instead. The two even disclosed the fact that the initial plan was to have Ali Noor on the guitars and Ali Hamza on the vocals, which thank God didnât happen! It hurts me to know thereâs still space left for the band to sink lower*sigh*The most frequently asked question was âaap baal kyun nahi katwatey?â, which made Ali Noor get that âwhat-the-hell-is-your-problem?â look on his face. The end was near and yet nothing out of the blues had happened. It got me wondering where all the anti-noorites were? (Oh! And I did try to call in but couldnât get through!) My eyes started to pain since I had already rolled them a gazillion times but the last three callers made it worth it. The conversation was something like: Caller1: Ali jee, my name is Amna .Do you remember me? We have met! Noor: I would know you by face Amna. Caller1: Iâm the same girl who met you in Murreeâs Usmania when you were with                 Anushay .You gave me an autograph on my bill. Noor (*blinks*): Uh, yeah I remember you. (Phone line disconnected) Host: Oh-Ho, disconnect hogayaâ¦ try again. â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦. Caller2: Hey! I wanted to ask Ali Hamza how he came up with his song BC? Whatâs                 story behind it? Mandana (ever-so-eagerly): Jee, your question has been noted down. Iâll soon ask                                                  Hamza. And so she did. Twice (most probably in order to get back at Noor for dissing her). The first time Hamza ignored it slyly. The second time Mandana emphasized and Hamza blinked, looked blank and said,âkaunsa gana?â Talk about lameness! Ali noor barged in and changed the topic and this time Mandana let go. The third caller was the most interesting one. Caller 3: hello, I am blah blah. I have heard that Mandana zaidi and Ali Noor were having an affair. How true is that? (Mandana turns beetroot, Noor smilies, Hamza get an ear-to-ear grin, and the other two hosts have confused looks on their faces) Host: Umm, weâll ask your question .Bye â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦ Needless to say, the question wasnât asked but an uncomfortable feeling did hang in the air. The show ended soon after that and I decided to flip through the channels once more before hitting the sack. The glam-filled dramas were still running on star plus, the pushto movie was about to end on uni tv(or so it seemed), the porn channel was still on and yes, as usual, there was Noori on IM!"
421481,3952922,2004-08-17,"*Paan Ki Dukaan*   ""An all chick band? Pakistani? Uh-Huh.Not possible."" That's the most frequent reaction to PKDâs (Paan ki dukaan) existance. But we swear we exist! Erm, true we don't really qualify for the term ""band"" but you cannot even call us ""not-a-bandâ. I mean we are there, present in the underground music scene and we know we'll never enter the mainstream but heck! We still rock! It all started within one week of the two of us becoming friends. Fanatic as we were about the desi rock scene, it wasn't hard to imagine ourselves as a band. After mustering up all our courage, we kinda gave our mums the 'outline' of what was on our minds and *booooom* Needless to say, we never brought the matter up again. We put our extra-genius brains to work and found a substitute for our dreams. We would make a band, but won't join the mainstream. After all both of us were already bathroom singers and no one seemed to mind that! Once we made the deal final, we were ready to face anything at all that came up. The very next moment we realized we didn't have any instruments nor a penny (yes, stuff was THAT bad). They say necessity is the mother of invention and we couldn't agree more. The idea clicked to Hira, the more creative one among us. We made a guitar (which isn't really as good as a real one but still!!!) out of a shoebox. Amazed? Don't be! All we had to do was make a hole through the side of the box and attach it with thick wood stick and cover the entire thing with three strands of long (real long) rubber band for strings and there! The guitar was ready! Saphiyaâs guitar. Saphiyaâs very own guitar. Homemade, fake but it was a guitar and it was all mine. ALL mine. Ah! Paradise: D Hira is the groovier one and her passion was solely for drums (though saphiya is the one who has a bad bad crush on waqar! *slurp*) The drums weren't a problem. Not at all. What is kitchen equipment for? We turned a plastic chair upside down, inverted two pateelas (read: haandees/thingi you cook food in:/) over the legs of the chairs and we even attached the lids of the pateelas for the 'extra' effect. Drumsticks were obviously spatulas and spoons. There! The ""instrument problem"" was solved. *Sigh* The next issue that came up was our name. We didn't want to sound 'oh-so-sophisticated' by using some French word nor did we want to sound conceited by using our own names (erm, ali noor doesn't get to read this, does he? *blinks*) Since we are desi girls with desi minds and desi music, the name we came up with was as desi as could be. Paan ki dukaan. *Winks*After this was decided, we covered our guitar and drums with shimmering paan wrappers to give the look we wanted and at our all girls' gig that are held at our studio (aka saphiya's storeroom), every person receives the chocolate flavored paans. *Slurp* Our music is not categorised.We'll do any kind. Rock, rap, jazz, Bhangra, pop, metal, punk rock, death metal...name it, we like it. We don't really have any proper songs to our account because we don't have the resources to make them but Yeah we did something which bands like junoon took years to do*evil grin*we ripped a song.'Ripped' is an understatement. We slaughtered the lyrics, scrambled the tune and VIOLA! We had our very own song. Itâs called ""Tu boring ho Gaya hai"", ripped from one of the Uk bhangra bands. Red-hot flaming potato isn't our only inspiration (Doesn't every band like to use that word for the bands they copy? *giggle*giggle*) we adore the commercial advertisementsâ jingles too. We soon plan to make a song called ""paan chahiyey.kaunsa janab?"" *grins*  Frankly speaking, we know we won't ever enter the mainstream but what we want to say here is that girls are capable of almost everything. I mean, we had nothing to back us up. No sources, no support, nothing at all, if we could come up like this, then somebody who has all the resources can work miracles. And we know there are girls with support and resources but they are too shy to come out. When we started we didn't know our next door neighbor would even know we existed but thanks to online forums and orkut, we have gained a little popularity. Weâre even thinking of launching a website in a couple of months (yeah! As soon as we get jobs as dj's on some fm *pouts*) what's better, Faisal Shah even volunteered to model for our 'in-our-dreams' only videos. *Jumps up and down*we might borrow some instruments from our friends and record some covers on our stuck-up computers. The proverb,'where there is a will, thereâs a wayâ, seems to be more meaningful now ainnit? So all you sisters out there go for it if you can. The 'first paki all girlsâ band' label is gone but you can strive to be the second *wink*wink*.And if any parent reads this (which I seriously doubt), please don't underestimate your daughters and back them up like you would do for your sons. Itâs the 21st century! HELLO! Cheers By : Saphiya Khan(aka the showboxist/vocalist)"

Life is queer with its twists and turns, As everyone of us sometimes learns, And many a failure turns about When he might have won had he stuck it out, Don't give up though the pace seems slow, You may succeed with another blow.   Success is failure turned inside out, The silver tint of the clouds of doubt, And you never can tell how close you are, It may be near when it seems so far, So stick to the fight when you're hardest hit It's when things seem worst that you must not quit."

426678,4032740,2004-07-30,"See?  urlLink Even Republicans donât trust these things , despite Republican Governor Bushâs reassurances that the machines are hunky dory.     So, again I ask: what possible good can it serve to prohibit these machinesâ having a paper audit trail? To what end is this prohibition? Think about it. Hard.  Donât trust them.

426679,4032740,2004-07-28,"Here in lovely Snohomish County, we use touchscreen electronic voting machines.   Well, by golly, guess what!  urlLink CNN reports  that a âcomputer crashâ obliterated votes recorded using these touchscreen machines in Florida (where else). Apparently this poofing-away of votes into the ether took place in May and November of 2003, wiping out records from the September 2002 gubernatorial primaries and other elections.   Interestingly, the malfunction was never disclosed to the public until the Miami-Dade Election Reform Coalition, a citizen's group, requested all data from the 2002 gubernatorial primary between Democratic candidates Janet Reno and Bill McBride. Imagine that.   More interestingly, officials had not backed up this data. Hello, my ninety-five year old aunt, who collects family genealogical information on her ancient Tandy computer, knows to back up her data lest it be irretrievably lost.  urlLink Who on earth  is running the show in Florida? Why would they not have plans in place to have this data backed up?   More interestingly yet, they have a rule in place in Florida which prevents counties from conducting manual recounts of electronically gathered votes. What, pray tell, is up with that? What possible end could that serve?   Lida Rodriguez-Taseff, a lawyer for the citizensâ coalition that uncovered this fiasco, sums it up best in the  urlLink NY Times : âFlorida is headed toward being the next Florida.â   Unless Snohomish County turns out to be the next Florida, that is.   There are two things you need to do if you donât want your ballot to be an exercise in futility:     First and foremost, get on the list to receive a  urlLink perpetual absentee voter form  from the Snohomish County Auditor. This is the only way you have, as a resident of Snohomish County, to ensure that a physical record exists of your vote. Get it in the mail, fill it out at home, and drop it off personally at your local polling station the day of the election.     Next, contact  urlLink Snohomish County Auditor  Bob Terwilliger and let him know you have extreme reservations regarding these contraptions, in general, and in particular their baffling and inexplicable lack of a physical audit trail. Bob is a very nice gentleman who does a fantastic job for us, but he needs to know what you think about these machines, which appear more and more to be simple Election Theft Devices.     I never thought Iâd see the day when we in the United States would need oversight of our election processes by an observer body, but apparently thatâs where weâre at. Donât tolerate it."

Apparently three shotgun-toting ruffians knocked on some guy's door at midnight, knocked him out with a rock when he answered the door, tied him up, ransacked the joint, then tossed him in the back of their van, stole his own van, and finally got pulled over by one of Marysville's finest--thanks entirely to a busted headlight.

426683,4032740,2004-07-25,"What gives with the way trees are managed in Snohomish County? If you own a property in a residential neighborhood (here in  urlLink Lynnwood , anyway) then good luck cutting down one of your trees, regardless that itâs your personal property. One would imagine the impetus behind this kind of local government intrusiveness is a well intentioned but big-brotherly attempt to ensure that trees arenât removed willy-nilly, thereby preserving the suburban woodland texture and ambiance of our corner of Washington.  Leaving aside the competing effect that our numerous shoddy strip malls and trashy trailer parks already have on our pristine wonderland, the best possible argument to remove this restriction is the simple fact that Lynnwoodians at large are hardly itchinâ to break out the chainsaws en masse. If a private citizen wants to remove his privately owned tree, heâs got a good and valid private reason and that should be plenty good enough for the city fathers. By and large, the average homeowner appreciates the beneficial effects that trees have on his property and would only remove one if need be.  Besides, one would imagine that the city fathers would target the prime offenders rather than John Q. Public. Have they never observed the way these pre-fab, cheap-ân-tawdry housing developments are slapped together? They usually go up in the immediate vicinity of longstanding residential neighborhoods populated by owners who are limited with what they may do with their privately owned trees. Typically, construction on the housing development begins with clear cutting every last evergreen from the area to be developed. Talk about coddling megabuck developers and holding them to a different standard than Joe Sixpack.  When at last the Barbie Playhouse look-alike apartment homes are landscaped, the flora consists of a few juniper shrubs and, of all things, cheap deciduous trees that donât even belong here (and which, to boot, provide all the more breeding ground for the infernal gypsy moth).   Trees in these developments should be replaced with the evergreens that were cleared out to make way for them. This is, after all, the  urlLink Evergreen State . Meanwhile, strike the law that prohibits free use of private property."
426684,4032740,2004-07-25,"urlLink Congressman Jay Inslee's  campaign for reelection to Washington's 1st Congressional District seat got off to a rollicking start yesterday at Edmonds Woodway High School in Edmonds.   Ambassador Joe Wilson was the featured speaker, and yours truly had the pleasure of shaking the man's hand. Although his wife Valerie Plame wasn't in attendance, her uncle, a newly former Republican from Portland, was. Apparently the gentleman was a Republican active in his party for years, but when he had the audacity to voice a measure of displeasure about his neice's cover as a CIA agent being blown by the Bush administration, his contemporaries drummed him out of the party despite years of loyal service.   It's not as if anybody requires further proof at this stage, but for the record that does tell one all one needs to know about the depths to which the once great Republican party has fallen. Imagine, deliberately blowing the cover of an American agent, endangering her life. Imagine, defending that kind of treason.   I don't know about you, but that doesn't sound like anything any of the Republicans I know would ever do. Then again, they're not running the party these days.

426685,4032740,2004-08-03,"Ah... Baseball, Mom and Apple Pie! Or is that âBallfields, Carlots and Antenna Farms?â  Appearance versus reality. We all come to grips with the difference between the two sooner or later, but the kids of Snohomish County are getting a first-hand lesson earlier than they should have to, along with a primer in sleaze politics, by virtue of their being used as hostages by two of the factions fighting in the desperate, grabassdick fight for cheap land here in Snohomish County.  Basically, it appears that both the North- and South-Snohomish Little League organizations built ballfields on farmland in direct violation of the law. The Seattle Times reported that after a neighbor complained about the traffic and lack of permits, Code Enforcement issued a stop-work order since the fields were plainly illegal--and the very next day, County Councilman Jeff Saxâs office sent an email to the planning department, copying fellow Councilman Kosterâs office, requesting that the stop-work order be lifted so they could get on with the projectâthis despite the fact that the project was, as mentioned, in direct violation of the law.  You have to ask yourself a couple questions. First, what kind of person commits hundreds of thousands of dollars of his Little League organizationâs money to building ballfields that are in flagrant violation of the law? My answer is, âa dumb ass.â Secondly, what kind of councilman actually encourages the illegal construction of ballfields in flagrant violation of the law? My answer is, âa crooked politician with an ulterior motive.â  Bottom line, it appears that Councilman Sax, untroubled by the prospect of using children as pawns and holding them hostage to achieve his political aims, encouraged the Little League organizations to proceed with the illegal construction of the ballfields, allegedly allaying their concerns with promises that the law prohibiting their construction would be changed in Olympiaâand the trusting and well-intentioned (albeit myopic and self-centered) Little League organizations willingly listened to these sweet nothings and went merrily ahead with the construction.  Predictably, the law was, in fact, not changed in Olympiaâthe proposed change having been defeated as it had been defeated every other year since it was first introduced.  At the end of the day, the Little League organizations either outright failed to perform due diligence or their counsel was breathtakingly incompetent, as the construction was clearly illegal from the get-go. And despite this, they willfully chose to go ahead with it anyway, risking their own kidsâ baseball seasons on a brazen gamble that forgiveness would be forthcoming where permission was notâespecially if they appealed strongly enough to maudlin emotion to justify their lawbreaking.  I donât know about you, but if I decided to break the law, I highly doubt that âI did it for the kids!â would be considered a valid excuse. Itâs Responsibility Time, folks.   STRIKE ONE!  â Against the reckless, and may I say shockingly self-centered Little League organizations.  Then thereâs Councilman Sax, who appears to have given an absolutely virtuoso performance in playing the Little Leagues like a bunch of moronic suckers by luring them into building their ballfields illegally. The image of hundreds of teary-eyed children being denied the right to play baseball would make one hell of a propaganda tool to garner the average voterâs pityâthereby doing much to contribute to a public willingness to change state law for a county problem which he, to all appearances, incubated.   STRIKE TWO!  â Against Sax. Politics is dirty, this we all knowâbut politicians, at least, are adults and know what theyâre getting into. To gamble with childrenâs life experiences like this, wellâ¦ thatâs about as low as it gets, even for a career politician like Sax. There really are no words for this level of contemptibility.  Finally, thereâs Councilman Koster, whoâs come out trying to assign the blame for this whole pathetic fiasco to â1000 Friends of Washington,â of all organizations. 1000 Friends, being an environmental group, exists to protect the environment against the depredations of developers and their bought-and-paid-for politicians, like Koster and Sax. Kosterâs blame-spreading is actually side-splittingly hilarious in light of the fact that 1000 Friends has, incredibly, voiced a willingness to overlook the illegal land-grab and work to change the law at the county level to grandfather in the ballfields. Their position is a case study in practical compromise, and makes sense since itâs a county problem that the County Council helped create. Itâs also mighty generous considering that the purpose of 1000 Friends is to guard against precisely this kind of raping and pillaging of our natural resources.  Believe it or not, Koster will have none of it. So:   STRIKE THREE  â Against Koster, for demonstrating to us his idea of personal responsibility: âblame environmentalists.â  The fact that Sax and Koster are digging in their heels and refusing to work pragmatically to change the law at the county level tells you everything you need to know about their objectives. It seems pretty obvious that they set out to get the children into an extreme situation tailor made to solicit your sense of pity and urgency, use this deliberately nurtured county problem as a wedge to force a change in a state law theyâre trying to kill off on behalf of their masters, and scapegoat an environmental group in the process.  Their unwillingness to solve this at the county level is particularly illuminating considering that they had no problem fixing similar problems at the county levelâwhen it was a carlot and an antenna farm needing their ministrations and intervention, instead of a bunch of unwealthy, bothersome Little Leaguers.  Nice guys, wouldnât you say?  You have work to do come election time, Snohomish County. Give Aaron Reardon a County Council that will do things for the right reason and put a human face on county politics."
429820,3962045,2004-07-25,"We did some major cleaning in our apartment this weekend. Kitchen is the most difficult to clean, with all the oil-mixed dust on top of the cabinet, it's really difficult to get them off. Fortunately, we have Cif, which is very good to get stubborn stain to come out. Our kitchen is very clean now :-)  Sunday is almost gone, and so does the weekend. I've already bought two tickets for I,Robot this evening 6:30pm show. I'm looking forward to it. The last good movie I missed was The Day After Tomorrow. I guess I've to wait for the CD to be released. It's not the same as watching in cinema, but it's better than not watching it at all."
429821,3962045,2004-07-24,"These are the signs that can be useful to tell:-   1. Confronting the boss openly in the meeting, especially when there are people from other department in the meeting too.   2. Seem to willingly accept any additional workload without much complaint. I'm not talking above being positive attitude, but accepting workload even beyond 100%.   3. Doesn't bother to clarify the scope of roles and responsibility with other members of the projects.   4. Unusually easy going. Anything also can."
429822,3962045,2004-07-22,"At the beginning of a project, it is important that we clear the roles and responsibilities of everyone. The tendency is to leave things in grey area, and adopt casual approach. But such approach would lead to a lot of conflict and misunderstanding in the later stages. Especially when manpower resources are hard pressed, the more thorough and formalised the roles and responsibilities are to be defined.   That's what I learn recently, when we are facing with headcount freeze (and even cut!). We used to tolerate each others, you do less, I do a little more, it's alright. But that only possible when we have enough capacity to make that extra concession -- give and take, so call. But when we all are stretched beyond 100%, we simply don't have the capacity to make such concession. Things getting more formalised now. It has to be clear whether it's my part of the job or yours. It's not that I'm difficult person to work with, but it's simply the circumstantaces forces me to take that formal approach. And it turned out to be good thing, because after we all sat down and discuss our specific roles and responsibilities, things get cleared up really well. We are nice people by nature, it's only that the company policy that decided to load up above and beyond 100% that made us become less tolerant to one another. So no wonder in bad company nobody is happy."
429823,3962045,2004-07-20,"It's never a good idea to adopt concensus decision making style across the board. The organisation would end up like country club instead of company. Sure, there are times when building concensus amongst the staff are important, but we cannot afford to always go by concensus. The purpose of our existance as a company is to satisfy external needs, not to satisfy internal needs (make employees happy). Only country clubs exist to satisfy the needs of its members.   That's what I observed happening in the circle of management in my department. Everything is decided based on concensus. As the result, every small matter is debated at great length and details. Nobody can agreed with anybody on any idea. Managers always (99% of the times) argue over even the smallest and most trivia matter. All of them are bulding turf and castle for themselves. Now I understand, why it's a good practice to move people about frequently -- especially those in management capacity. Even at the cost of disruption, it is still worth the effort."
429824,3962045,2004-07-16,"When there's increase of quantity of work, without the corresponding increase in manpower, the quality would inevitably decrease. Very simple concept, isn't it? But I'm very amaze how most management people in my company don't get this. No kidding! They load us with work as if we are bottomless pit! Ever wonders why Dilbert materials are selling like hot cakes? This is the reason, because it's rather comforting to know that not only my company is in Dilbert Ville, but many others too. Economy has not pickup yet. Otherwise, people would start migrating out from the Dilbert Ville -- the good and capable ones, I must say."
429825,3962045,2004-07-15,"When people are overworked they become unhappy. And when they become unhappy the chance of misunderstanding occurs becomes higher. I got into some misunderstanding email exchange with one of my colleagues this afternoon. Email was never a good medium to clear up misunderstanding to begin with. But I was so overworked lately such that I don't have any spare tolerant level to try clear things up offline. So I just hit the reply button and fire away. Such thing probably would not happen if I was less agitated by the way our bosses load me and my other colleagues with work. And often it's trivial and clerical work that contribute none whatsoever to our professional career development. So if people are not happy with their working place, why bother to try to get along with the co-workers? If this continues at the end the organisation suffers, because all these will eventually affect our customer service."
429826,3962045,2004-07-12,"Are we really the most valuable resource of the organization? I would like to think so. My bosses said so. But the actual actions taken by the very same people who proclaimed that people are most important asset of the organization are contradicting that very message! My colleague has been waiting to be deployed to another project for months. And nothing happen yet. Not because there's no other projects that need him, but it's because our bosses here are not ready to release him without securing a replacement first. So he feels very much at lost and in limbo now -- not very certain how his career would turn out in the next 6 months (and that's how long he could potentially need to wait). In the mean time, ""they"" just park him here to take care of some mundane tasks, without important responsibilities (because they afraid that he could be gone or redeployed anytime). I would like to think that there got to be more control that we have over our career. It should not be like this. Our life and career at the hand of our bosses (people who said they care, but really aren't at all!). But the sad thing is, with the current state of economy, there are not many option out there. What can I say, it's an employer's market now. You know what's more frustating? I could be next in line in the same situation, because my posting to the current project is about to expire (or reach the maximum allowed deployment time). And our HR would start to kick a big fuzz to have me redeployed, and our bosses would start to worry about finding out suitable replacement, and... and... the whole stupid things will repeat again. All in the name our keeping fresh idea, able to think out of the box, breakout from comfort zone, etc. etc. etc. but at the end of the day, they really are messing people life."
429827,3962045,2004-08-02,He just resend his email annoucement :-) Hmm... I wonder if he figured out the bad attachment himself or someone actually borther to open these things.
429828,3962045,2004-08-02,"Sometimes attachments in Lotus Notes is strange. For any reason, the Word icon is attached instead of the actual Word document. So when I try to click on the attachment, it was recognised as picture instead of attachment. One of my colleagues send out mass email announcement with Word documents attached. But one of the attachments are icon instead of the documents. Should I tell him? Nah... probably not. He probably won't appreciate it. And he probably thought I was too free to even borther to try to open the attachments, as if reading the email itself is not time consuming enough."
429829,3962045,2004-08-02,"When you think of it, in the corporate world, there's always a bigger dog out there. Once I was working with my pointy-haired manager. He's always licking his boss' *you know what*. But then I really even his boss is also licking someone else's *you know what*, so that's the truth about corporate world. There's always a bigger dog around. So what's the moral of this story?  It's forget about who your boss is trying to please. Just concentrate on your own work, and let your boss do the licking  job :-)  afterall, we the real contributor, the knowledge worker, the professional, are not defined by our bosses. We can stand on our own's feet, based on our own achievement. It's those who don't have any real skill that need to do licking."

436409,4220482,2004-08-13,"Hi! Welcome to my first blog. Created on Friday the 13. (Opps, not to forget -- August 2004) Ha Ha!! Sinagpore Time = 2:45pm"
438444,3736933,2004-06-30,"We have taken it alot easier today. We turned up at rehearsals last night only to find that nothing was ready yet. Us Koori's we have our 'Korri Time' well the Greeks here they have Greek time, ie the Olympics arenas not finished yet with like two weeks til the games atcually start. So anyway, Emma and Allan didn't get to have their sound check last night, we waited for ages, but the Greeks were working on their own time, things were supposed to be ready at 5:30pm and when 7:30pm came around and nothing was finished ie the stage, lighting, sound, we all decided to go back to the hotel and have dinner.   Our cab ride back from the museum was something we would not forget. The taxi driver was playing dumb, and trying to take us around the whole world, acting like he never knew where he was going, anyway, we came up to a street and he couldn't get through, there was police and army people everywhere. The taxi driver ordered us out, and said that their was a demonstration on and that we had to walk now. We barely knew where we were, and then all of a sudden we hear these loud screams and chanting going on. We started walking up the street, there was so many police everywhere, Emma was freaking out, we held each others hands, as we watched hundreds of people match the street, angry their voices. We didn't understand a word what was going on, and we were too scared to ask anyone. Today at our hotel we found out the march was a protest to the US embassy in regards to the war in Iraq.   The night ended quietly, I had sore feet by the time we got back to the hotel, it was again another early night.  Today we decided to take it easy. We had a quiet breakfast, and I watched Al iron all my clothes, pretty impressive he works good, ha ha, I train him good, jokes. And after that we headed down to the markets again for some more shopping. Wait til you see all the jewellery Al bought me. We walked around and then met up with the rest of the crew for lunch with Jennifer Bott who works for the Australia Arts Council. Lunch was great, we went to a great restaurant near the Plaka.   This afternoon Al and Emma are just practicing at the hotel,  the exhibition starts at 8:30pm. I am just about to go and ready, dressing up for the night. Jennifer told us that channel nine and channel seven are here from Australia, and that Cathie Freeman is sending a video message, and their is going to be lots of Australian Press, so I have to be looking the goods for the media, ha ha.   We are off on a cruise tomorrow to visit the islands of Agena, Poros and Hydra, they are fairly close to Athens, we would have loved to travel to Myconos, or Santorini, but time won't allow us, I think it is 6 hours ferry to Myconos. I am just excited to head to the beach and have a swim."
438445,3736933,2004-06-29,"It is around 3:20pm on Tuesday afternoon. I am feeling extremely drained, we have had the biggest day. But I will start off with last night. Emma, Allan and the crew finally arrived at 7:30pm last night. They looked completely stuffed, and Emma's bag was lost, she got it back this morning (bloody QANTAS) ha ha. Anyway I waited for them to shower and we headed down town to find some dinner. We stopped off at a busy little taverna in one of the narrow streets not far from our hotel. The food was absolutley devine. I had the house speciality which consisted of lamb souvalaki, and garlic sauce on pita bread with salsa type stuff on top. I don't know the greek name but it was so yummy. Al and Emma had mixed Giros, and we all left the table holding our bellies. As they were all so tired, we retreated back to our rooms for an early night.  I was up as usual at 6am. Breakfast at the hotel, and then we headed for the markets. We passed lots of flash shops, but we looked mostly at the flea markets for little gifts. We walked all the way to the Ancient Agora. The road was really dusty, and bumpy with lots of rocks etc. We wandered along the paths to the top of the mountain to the Acropolis. We saw the Theatre of Dionysos, temple of Olympian Zeus and the Odeum of Herodes. The view from the top was magnificent. As this is my second trip to Athens I was surprised how the scenary still was able to captivate me. Allan was enjoying himself, camera happy taking pictures everywhere. Once I get back I will post some on this site (I still have to invest in a digital). Al missed a perfect photo opportunity as I fell over on the steps walking down from the Acropolis, nothing hurt though, just embarassment as it happened in front of plenty of tourists, ha ha.   After a few hours of touring around the lankmarks, we headed back to the city for some lunch. We ate at a great little cafe outside the gates of the Agora City. I love Mousakka, and I stuffed myself on this. We did a bit more shopping on the way back to the hotel.   Allan and Emma are getting their stuff ready as they have rehersals at 5:30pm over at the Benaki Contempory Museum where they will perform tomorrow night. It is getting exciting."
438446,3736933,2004-06-27,"I arrived in Athens at 6:30am this morning, Greece time, but I think it was around 1:30pm Sydney time. The trip felt like it was never going to end, I guess it felt even longer as I was and still am by myself. Allan and the band are arriving tonight, their flight gets in at 5:30pm. I really feel for them, as they left before me yesterday, but cause their flight went via London it is taking them longer to get here. My flight wasn't that bad, I have been a great observer and had a few chuckles along the way. It was so funny last night, I was stopped over in Singapore for 2 1/2 hours, and I couldn't get over all these little old greek couples, they seemed to be bickering amongst themselves, and it all seemed to do with who was first, and going first. I had the same impression when I arrived at Athens airport. I was practically left for dead, trampled on as they all ran for passport lines, and then the baggage collection. I almost felt invisible as they pushed past me. But I had to laugh about it.  With the Olympics within weeks, I definately thought the airport security would have been fairly tight, but not all. After I finally made it the window to the customs/immirigration line, I was shocked that the guy didn't even say BOO to me. He took my passport looked at it, and stamped it, and pointed past him, not even a hello. My bags were not checked, scanned or x-rayed, I could have hid anything in it, but never mind, really it made getting out the place quicker.  My ride in the taxi to Plaka, where I am staying at the Electra Hotel was funny as. The taxi driver attempted to check how cluely I was, first acting like he didn't speak english, and then questioning me, I had a few phrases, and greetings written down in Greek, so I tried my foriegn tongue out, not bad I thought, and must have impressed him, as he didn't rip me off, and actually gave me a discount fair, well atleast I thought it was, it cost me $25 Euro, which is almost $50 Aus.  So I am now contemplating which way I will go, I think it is just after 10am here, after 5pm Sydney time, I just tried a Greek Mac, at Maccas, I was starving and it was the easiest thing to order, it tasted good, on a wrap bread with a yoghurt style sauce intsead of our mac's. I think I am going to wander around the streets until Allan and the rest of the crew arrive."
438447,3736933,2004-06-24,"What a fabulous gift. This is my first entry of many, and I am sure I will have a few stories to tell, and if you know me, I am sure you are nodding your head right now. I closed another chapter today, my last day working at UTS in the Faculty of Education Student Services City Campus. My stomach bloated (from my fabulous good bye luncheon at Cafe Otto )as I contemplate how to find the words to describe the wonderful people I have been working with since September. The memories are many, the laughs and tears I have shared. I hope I have definately left something with all of you guys. I know I haven't been much of an office worker, but I hope I have been someone who's spirit, you will always remember. Well I think I have a voice you will never forget, hey Shalini, or should I say Shazza Mazza!!! Well I love writing, but this is something new for me, collecting my thoughts and typing them into a computer. So bare with me, and my entries as I begin to learn how to use this site, and hopefully add some lovely pics! I will take you on my little adventures, and the dramas of just being me. First stop Athens, Greece. So I will sign off for now, but don't worry I will post a new entry very soon."
438448,3736933,2004-07-02,"Well I just got off a 10 hour flight, and now I am waiting in Singapore airport, it is just after 6 in the morning over here, it is two hours behind Sydney. I am getting ready for my connecting flight to home sweet home. I am planed out, and airport outed, I mean I just want to go home and find my bed. I am sick of getting pushed around in the airport, and waiting in queues for everything.  Right now I really can't wait to be home, I am really tired, I couldn't sleep much on the flight, I watched so many movies and did some boring crosswords.   Well I will see you all in Sydney then."
438449,3736933,2004-07-02,"Well my time in Athens Greece has been fantasic, I mean I really could find lots of words to describe the time I have had, but my taxi is picking me up in 15mins to take me to the airport, so I really have to get a move on.  The Greeks, they love to smoke (and smoke everywhere in taxi's, restaurants, while riding scooters and just about anytime), they love to eat (the best Gyros, souvalki and moussaka) and they love bright clothes and shoes (women in heels at the Acropolis, bright reds, oranges and yellow clothes, and lots of shoe shops.  I love the weather and the people have been so friendly and helpful with everything.  I will arrive back in Sydney tomorrow night, see you very soon, I don't really want to come home yet."
438450,3736933,2004-07-02,"We cruised three islands yesterday on our ship the Anna Maru. At 7:30am we were picked up at the hotel and transfered to the marina to board the vessel. There were lots of tourists from Italy, France and even some other Aussies on board. We headed to the top deck to soak up the sun, which was absolutely gorgeous, there was light breeze that made it even more enjoyable as it was nice and refreshing.  First port of call was the island of Poros, time was limtied here, so Al and I just wandered the tiny little streets and looked in the shops. Our next island was Hydra. It was magnificent. Just like the postcards and paintings, all the buildings were white with little blue shutters on them. The locals were so friendly as they called you into their shops, one guy told us that the rpice of livign is extremely expensive their, and that the locals relied on the thousands of tourists for income. We walked around the port and up a hill to find a little swimming spot. It was beautiful. Imagine, walking a quaint little path and steps, to find the shore, sparkling crystal blue water, just waiting for you to dive in. Aroundthe shore line, was a cave that you could swim into. There were many little kids running and jumping form the top, their laughter was inviting, and Al and I joined them jumping into the cool water. The bottom seemed to go on forever, we both couldn't get over the clearness of the water.  Our final stop was the Island of Agena. Here we hired a little scooter. We had wanted to get one for ages, as we thought it would be fun. It cost us $15 Euro for an hour, which is close to $30 Aus dollars, but it was well worth it. While others were walking round, we flew past them on the scooter. Al riding, and me holding on for my life on the back. He was doing 60 and it was only 30 permited, but I don't think they have speed cameras, jokes. Ha ha. We rode to the other side of the island and found our own quiet little spot by the shore and went for a swim. I was starting to feel the sun then, my arms, neck and face are really browner, I got a tan , ha ha ha.   Our cruised ended back at Pieurus and we were transfered by coach back to our hotel. We were so stuffed, we finally hit the shower at 9pm, and were too lazy to go and get dinner so we ordered room service."
438451,3736933,2004-08-16,"Today was my first day on the University of Hawaii Manoa Campus. I left with the other Norwegian girls at 8am and caught the bus. It kind of scary as we were not too sure where to go. I had a map and remembered some instructions Kerri-Ann had given me, so that was a start. We walked for what seemed for ages. The sun burning our skin as we treked along the road. Almost there we stopped at the University Health Services. We knew we had to get a check up there so we decided to get over and done with before getting to Rosemary's office. I was really unsure about the testing because of the baby. The nurse reassured me it was safe. They gave me a test in the skin for Tuberculous and they also gave me a blood test for the measles. After the blood test, I was faint, I collapsed on the floor out cold. I didn't remember how it happened, I just opened my eyes and I felt myself breathing so heavily. I was felt hot and was sweating. I had two nurses near me, one raising my legs and the other holding my hand and checking my pulse. I couldn't move, they eventually got me up into a wheelchair and took me to a bed to lie down and check me. I fell side ways, so the baby was okay. They checked me over, my blood pressure before letting me go. I didn't feel the best after that. I have a bruise on my arm from the blood test. I thought to myself later, if I can't handle a blood test, how am I going to handle labour, it makes me laugh. But the nurse said it is not uncommon for pregnant women to feel faint, especially seen as though I have just arrived and am adjusting in here to the climate etc.  After we left the health service we went to meet our International Exchange Officer Rosemary. She was so lovely, she gave me a warm hug when she saw me. She later told me that Sam and I would be the first Aboriginal Students from Australia to study here, and it made me feel important and special. It is a huge opportunity for people like us from our backgrounds. Rosie gave us a check list of things we needed to complete for enrolment. We set off in different directions, I was alone as I had different majors than the rest of the group.  My emotions were mixed all day. I think the fall had put me off, and I was less confident. I struggled to get a dollar bill into a vending machine to get a drink. I guy who appeared to be helpful offered to exchange coins with me for my note. What I realised after he walked away, that he duped me. He gave me 2 quarter dollars and 2 five cent pieces instead of 4 quarters. I was so thirsty and it really annoyed me, I think it was intentional you know. I forgot about it and walked towards the International Student Services to complete some paper work over there. Again I got frustrated as I didn't have everything yet, I needed this, and I couldn't do that until I got this, etc etc, and I started to get upset as I felt like I didn't know what I was doing. I walked away, and thought I will try and get some money so I can atleast get organised for my health plan. The bank was a joke, they wouldn't cash all my travellers cheques, and then they wanted to charge me for this etc and that etc, so I just got my money and left.  I walked outside across the park, and I felt helpless. What had I achieved, it was after 1pm and I had been at the uni since 8:8am and had got nothing finished. I decided to pay Kerri-Ann a visit. I needed to see her about subjects and registering, but more than anything, I just needed a familiar face. As I entered her office, she stood up and reached out for me. It was just what I needed, a big hug. I held her as I felt tears well in my eyes. I fought them back, and I didn't want to show her I was too sad. I explained what I needed to do, and she agreed to help me. But first things first, she took me to one of her favourite restaurants. It was great, and immediately I started to feel better. We ate at California Pizza at Ala Moana. We sat and talked, and it was the first time I really got to open up to Kerri-Ann about myself. I needed to talk to her, and she was such an attentive listener. I felt so drawn to her. When I listen to her talk, I hear the passion in her voice, the sincerity and the emotion. It moves me. I want to be just like her. Her voice has more power than I think she realises. I have always looked at Joe Fraser my old lecturer and Leanne King my lecturer and year coordinator for strength. Although the age gaps, they all inspire me. I look at them and I feel like I can do it. I want that PhD and I want to be able to write, write the truth and tell the real stories of Aboriginal people like them and me.  Coming to Hawaii was about learning more about myself, and another culture and people. I have always believed you learn to look more inside yourself when you step outside your usual surroundings.  After lunch Kerri-Ann and I settled my subject choices. We couldn't register them so I will have to return to her tomorrow to check on it. I came back to the hotel and have felt exhausted. I had a little nap, and talked to Hege about her day. It is good to offload to someone else, as well as hear about how her experience is for her as well.  Tomorrow will be day 2 of getting enrolled. Lets see how that goes."
438452,3736933,2004-08-15,"Well we meet again, this time I am in Oahu, a beautiful island part of the state of Hawaii USA. I arrived last night at 11:20pm Hawaii time. The flight wasn't too bad, around 10 hours duration. I am staying at the Ocean Resort Hotel Waikiki. It is great, close to everything. I am sharing a studio unit with a girl called Hege from Norway. She is here studying on exchange just like me. I didn't get up to much last night, Kerri-Ann my wonderful Hawaiian contact picked me up from the airport. It was great to see a familiar face, she presented me with gifts of a necklace, a flowers lei and a candy lei. It was lovely.  I got to the hotel and was famished, I had to walk 5 blocks to find a convience store to get something to eat, phoned home and then forced myself to lay and rest to help the time difference. It is 20 hours behind Sydney over here.  The weather today has been beautiful. I went shopping to Ala Maona. It is a big mall on the other side of town. Over here they only know two directions, the mountains is one way, and the ocean is the other. Kerri-Ann said I should never get too lost, cause all you have to do is just look around and walk the other way.  My experiences with American/Hawaiian culture have already cracked me up. The money is the worst, I have to make sure I look at the notes properly as the money all looks the same. The coins are a pain as well. I had to ask someone how much a dime was, I have since found out it is 10 cents, see my nan was right, you learn something new everyday. Getting the bus to the shops was funny as well, I went to pay the driver and he laughed, and instructed me to put the money in this little machine, and I said to him, do I get a ticket, and he giggled again and said well do you want one, and I felt a little silly.  Everyone has been really friendly, there seems to be a lot of tourists and visiting people here, so much that it almost seems hard to pick out who are locals and who are not.  The view from my room is breath taking. On one side you see mountains, and the other side is the ocean, blue and sparkling. Around the city it is very green, lots of trees and plants, it is a really clean and beautiful place. I will post some photos as I have a new digital camera now, but I will have to wait til I go to uni tomorrow so I can do it. I am using the hotel computers and it costs alot of money."
439504,3592717,2004-07-05,"Kelly. Well theres alot 4 me 2 say.

I think that i might b rushin things alitle along but i cant help it. Shes all i think about , all the time. But it seems like we r goin at different speeds. Maybe i should slow down but like  i said. I cant help it. Im not mad at her because its not her fault. Its our parents fault and i think that they should trust their children more.

Heres the article: 4-year-old says he jumped 'like a superhero'  A 4-year-old would-be superhero escaped serious injury Saturday after he jumped from a second-story window at his family's north Spokane apartment building.  The boy, who was not identified by police, lives with his mother in the 600 block of north Oak. Police said the child jumped through an open, unscreened window and landed on grass below, narrowly missing a patch of concrete and a barbecue. Police Supervisonr Sgt. Marc Wheelwright said the fall could have killed the boy had he landed in the wrong spot. The boy told nurses he jumped through an open window ""like a superhero,"" according to Spokane Police. Officers said his mother and her boyfriend were asleep at the time, around 2 p.m. The window had been propped open by a stick, according to a police report. Police said the sill was about 2 feet from the floor. After being taken to the hospital, the boy was given a CT scan which showed no head injuries. He spent Saturday night in the hospital for observation and was listed in satisfactory condition.

Well im gonna tell you :-) ok hes this kid who instant messaged me one day on Yahoo. We talked every single day for at least 5-6 hours every night and then we talked on the phone a lil bit too. well we finally decided to meet. the day he came over to meet me i got hit by a car so i was havin a bad day but all that went away when i saw him. i was so excited to meet him. anyways we hung out a lil bit that day then he had to go to work. then the next day he came over and spent the night kinda, he had to leave early tho cuz he had to work at the Lilac parade (he was a crowd control person...he works for the SPD) so we watched movies pretty much all night, and he cuddled up next to me, and like 5 minutes later we started making out. this was my first time ever doing this with a guy. or anybody to tell you the truth. and it went a bit further but im not gonna talk about that. anyways after that i started to fall in love with him. and then the day after i pretty much asked him out, he asked me if i wanted to see his new boyfriend. i was so depressed! and he didnt even care. then he started bein a real asshole to me. I guess getting hit by that car the day i met him shoulda been a sign :-p. then he wouldnt even tell me when his graduation was, and we dont talk anymorel. which im fine with now. only time he ever IMs me is to see if he can have my laptop. i wish i never met him. i luv you Jake thanks for helping me through that! i dont know what id do without you... remember im always here for you too. but anyways thats what happened with Cameron. thanks for reading. check back later for more :-)"

We were guessing on a contact point and it looks like we guessed right. It's raining pretty moderately and the winds are getting up there. The hotel location is prime, the network is up, the landlines are sturdy and there's a pretty damn good lunch spread downstairs.  We're all in good spirits, after all we love this stuff.  Hopefully once Scott starts snapping photos and I start sending them to the office systems, I'll share some with you."
459918,3751152,2004-08-12,"A special blog to fill a special request.  I'm going to be away from my home for a couple of days, taking a road trip to around Sanibel Island to track  urlLink Hurricane Charley . I'll answer all potential questions in a Q & A.   Q: Why are you going?   A: I'm part of the New York Times Regional Newspaper Group emergency team along the Gulf Coast. If there's a decent Hurricane or equivalent catastrophe, I'm there with fellow team members Diane (reporter) and Scott (photographer). I am the third wheel due to my knowledge of the network system.   Q: What's your job?   A: I'm there to make sure the wireless connections will be supported. I call around to hotels on the Island to see which have the capabilities of keeping our network afloat. Then I book three rooms (one for Diane, one for Scott and I and one for the computers, etc.) and find an electrician that can wire the place if it isn't wired. From there I'm strictly a watchdog. I keep charges in the laptops, communications with the editors at the desk, give them weather updates, check the network, check the net to track the storm and transmit the stories from our location to the group.   Q: What happens if something goes wrong?   A: The only three things that can go wrong are: flooding and pipes busting can take away my plan B (landlines); the hotel collapses (I'll die) and the power goes out (thus I lose my wireless capabilities and we're forced to run our laptops on battery and use the landlines. If the landlines are floodieed we'll have to send from a pay phone, which use old ,old lines that can even stand up in the most violent flooding.   Q: How bad is this Hurricane?   A: Looks like an ambitious Cat 2, which means the winds will hit around 90-100 MPH. That's pretty nice but nowhere near as bad as Hurricanes like  urlLink Gilbert  in 1989 and of course  urlLink Andrew  in 1992, Gilbert was a Cat 4 when it made American landfall and Andrew was a moderate Cat 5. This Hurricane isn't close to that.   Q: Are you scared?   A: Not really, I'm more excited than anything else. I'll be fine.   Q: When kind of supplies do you bring for this sort of trip?   A: Well I use the basic Hurricane emergency guidelines. I should be back tomorrow evening or Saturday morning but I'm still packing for four days in case the roads need a day to be cleared or something. I have about 12 gallons of water, lots of canned foods, first-aid kits, towels, etc. Nothing out of the ordinary for an emergency kit.   Q: If I see you tonight on TCZ what do I do?   A: Say hi. I'm stuck in a room chilled to the bone (for the computers) while Diane and Scott are probably in the hotel lobby drinking and whooping it up with the Weather Channel people. I have a high speed and hotel cable so chances are I'm bored to tears.   Q: Who watches your dogs?   A: I'm pysched I have a new housesitter since my old one got pregnant and married on me. Hopefully the house will be in one piece when I get back and it seems like my dogs love the sitter so that's the least of my worries. If that falls through, I'll take them with me.  I'll have more exciting details later. If I'm on and can give a blow by blow of the Hurricane as it hits, that'll be even better.  Peace!"

I only have four (maybe 5) front teeth that aren't filled (yet). Give it time.       I went to the dentist Monday afternoon as I may have mentioned in the previous blog. Every one of the 6 month appointments I have ever had has led to more fillings, root canals, apisectomies... let's face it, my teeth are not known for their robust qualities. In fact the dentist has said (more than once) that my fillings are stronger than my teeth. Marvellous.       This time I only had to have one tiny filling in a tooth with no nerve. Fantastic. I was extremely pleased (sad, I know). Unfortunately today I had a phonecall from my dentist saying that actually the X-rays showed another filling that needed doing.       Maybe dentures are the way to go? Knowing my luck (which seems to be bad verging on awful atm) I would have badly fitting false teeth that would give me ulcers. Maybe I'll keep my own teeth.

I now go in sometime in September.  Kind of put a dampener on the last bit of the meet for me (I went home soon after).        It isn't that I particularly want to have a craniotomy.  It is more that I just want to get this all over and done with so that I can get back to a reasonably normal life (or what passes for one around here).

459922,3751152,2004-08-08,"Its now a little after 2am on Sunday night, and things are starting to quiet a bit at B10.  Some conversation is going on about rides scratched at Alton Towers, but for this blog it is more important to reflect upon the events of the last 2 B10!  When I last left off, we were off to the beach.  Upon arriving, we broke up into a couple of groups.  Some headed straight for the sand, while another group of us decided to see some fish up close and personal at the aquarium.  We got to see shark feeding time from a submerged transparent walkway in a rather large tank full of sharks, stingrays, and giant turtles.  After boing up on our natural sciences, the others I was with decided to do bumper cars, but I decided to take the rare opportunity to allow this land-locked resident of Switzerland with no closeby beach to walk along the Bournemouth coast and take in the the local scenery and beach babes!!!  We then all met up and took the train back, linking up with another group of spods who had chosen to forsake the beach wonders for the safer realms of a local pub.  It was time then to prepare for the big night out at Jazz Juice!  We first went to a couple of watering spots in Bournemouth to soak up some liquor and then made our way back to near the beach and into the nightclub.  JazzJuice was basically a 70s retro night.  We danced or sat on the edge of the dancefloor until about 2.00 am.  Then we grabbed taxis and headed back to consume a midnight snack before hitting the sack.  We also got to observe why it was not a good idea for a taxi company to ever dissapoint our meet host ...  After the spods finally awoke on Sunday morning, we went to a local establishment for some traditional English breakfasts.  The Sunday afternoon event was either bingo or the water park, depending on one's tastes.  Your blogger personally chose the waterpark choice, and despite the long ques, he was not disappointed with the miriad of slides and tube rides ...  It was then dinner at KFC (a treat for me as there are none in Switzerland) and then bowling, followed by some goes at the Dance Dance video game machine.  Then back to Matt's for another renedition of ""Fire Wire.""  Its now 2.30 am and time for some sleep!"
459923,3751152,2004-08-07,"So here I am, bloggin live from B10!  Its only my second day ever in England, but luckily the learning curve is not as steep as worried about :)  The fun all started on Friday, when I awoke at 3am after only 4 hours of sleep to drive to Zurich, where I would meet Reethi and Sunshine and catch a flight to merry olde England.  The day started out with lousy weather. Most of my driving was through rain and I could only hope that my decision to have brought only warm weather clothing would not be a horrible mistake. About 5.30 am, I arrived at the Zurich airport, parked the car, found the check in termal, changed some francs to pounds and waited for my two travel companions to show up. Luckily, they were not too late.  Sunshine looked the same as ever, but Reethi came with a new hairstyle, now without the blue..  The plane ride to London was for the most part uneventful..we nodded off a bit, but I awoke to discover us in a circling delay to land in London Heathrow.  Although we were delayed a bit, I enjoyed the circling pattern as I got to take in some of the sights of London from the air.  I even recogniyed the snaking bit of the Thames that one sees at the start of every Eastender episode!  Eventually, we landed, and we took the next leg of our trip southward starting with the Underground Tube.  Thus, I also got to see London from below ground - although I admit there was not much to see except a lot of people packed like Sardines reading their morning papers which either talked about the English football coach being cleared of his latest problems, or the more amazing revelation that one of the Big Brother candidates was actually a man earlier in life, but female now.  The headline read, ""Father of Big Brother candidate - I always wanted a daughter!!!""  When we reached Picadilly circus, it was time to change from the Tube to the Train. Now, as a faithful follower of the Chevy Chase Vacation movies, I remembered Picadilly Circus as this huge roundabout, which Americans seemed doomed forever to drive around in circles in.  I looked forward to seeing it and Big Ben, but alas all we had time to do after getting our tickets was to get a Burger King Breakfast to go.  We took our seats and we were finally southward bound to Bomo!  A few naps later and a few scares from some clouds, we arrived close to the MudMeet Mecca.  As we stopped in Christchurch, we noticed Ginge, Zebedee, and Trax walk bz. Christoph banged on the window, but Ginge in his dark glasses could not see us frantically waving at him.  The train went off to its next stop, where Sunshine and Reethi departed to check into their hotel and I went on to Pool and finally got the other spodders attention in their car though a text message.  Finally, Parkstone came!  It was a much smaller trainstation than I had expected.  But probably it was good as it was small as Matt's place was literally right next to it.  There I quickly found old faces such as Lorena Huxley, while meeting new spods in person for the first time, although it could feel quite strange, having spent hundreds of virtual hours with them.  People were just finishing breakfast despite it being more like 1pm.  We broke up into a couple of groups - one consisting mainly of women for shopping - and the rest at the pub next door.  I opted for the latter option and found myself quickly going through beer after beer - and then cider (not the American apple juice type) - and quickly worked up a buzz as spod after spod appeared.  I found the people quite easy to chat up and met a few non spodders, including a woman from the English Birmingham, which I found interesting, as my last job in America was in the other Birmingham (Alabama).  Finally, it was time to move on to the event of the evening - B2.  This was a small, but nice pub with a single pool table - which seemed like something for children as it was smaller than the standard Americna pool table.  The B9 tournament was finally finished, with Dafty beating out host Matt.  Games of Twister were to be had, but I never managed to get past 3rd place, despite my trainings in yoga.  Although most were wide awake, my early morning start was starting to get to me, combined with the heavy fish and chips I had for dinner.  I had to take a walk outside to clear my head. About midnight, we headed back to Matt's and listened to his heavy beats, including the favorite, ""Fire Wire.""  I was dead tired and managed to actually get some sleep despite the loud music.  Everyone crashed around 3am.  Saturday morning started with me being the lucky second for a shower, giving me plenty of time to enjoy a ""Vegetarian Breakfast"" at the small coffee spot down the street.  Its now almost 12 and am waiting for the last to finish their breakfast..then the beach comes!"
459924,3751152,2004-08-02,"Sometimes I might refer to my biological father, Gary, as Biodad when I'm talking about him. I kind of like it. It has a superhero quality tone to it (Up in the sky! It's a bird! It's a plane! It's... Biodad!) The reason I refer to him that way is because I've only known him for the past few years and most of that was just via email.  I grew up knowing of him, but he wasn't a part of my life. I had a wonderful stepdad who was and always will be my 'dad' and so I can't quite bring myself to refer to Gary as dad and I don't think I ever could. So I like Biodad. Anyway, after my dad passed away I began to feel curious about Biodad. But I didn't really pursue it. It wasn't anything more than an 'I wonder what he's like' curiosity anyway. All I knew of him was his name, that he and my mother went to high school together and dated for a bit and I was the result. A typical story really. I also knew he worked for a newspaper in Montana. That's it.  Well around 1999 or 2000, I can't recall which, I stumbled onto his address and email online when I put his name in on a lark. On a whim I decided to contact him via email and just see what happened. I figured it would be nice to know whether he would care or if he didn't want anything to do with me. That way I'd never go through life just wondering. I'm so grateful I did.  I wrote to him, though I can't recall exactly what I said. I do remember saying something along the lines of 'I promise not to drag you onto Jerry Springer for a surprise reunion' or something to that effect. Nervousness brings out the comic in me. Anyway he found that amusing and after the shock of my email wore off we began corresponding. Then I introduced him to instant messaging and we began actually chatting. I found I had a sister just a little older than my own daughter whom Gary brought with him the first time we all met. It was just a dinner at Applebee's that first time but it was very pleasant if a little bit awkward :)  Since then we've talked a lot more and hooked up a time or two when he's in town. His own father, who would be my grandfather lives here in my town, though I've yet to meet him. He's retired and I'd occasionally see him doing the greeter thing at Walmart - I imagine he did that to get out of his wife's hair :) It was weird seeing him knowing who he was, but he didn't know who I was. Very odd feeling.  So that's a bit of background on Biodad and the reason I'm writing all of this is because I think a new step has been passed after his last visit this past week. I miss him now. It's another weird feeling. He and his wife have divorced in the time that we've been writing to each other, and he has a new girlfriend now. This past week was his family's renunion in another city here in nebby so he brought her down with him for the week and stayed at a hotel across the street from my place. This meant we got to spend a lot more time with them. I adore his gf and think she's really cool - she's a junior high school teacher which means she was able to get along really well with my junior high school kid and both of them were incredibly supportive for me while I was going through this whole job thing.  It marked the first time I went to him for advice and support and he came through for me bigtime. It also marked the first time he spent time with my daughter without me around as they ""borrowed"" her for the day and took her with them as they did an 'About Schmidt' tour of Nebraska, hitting the pioneer museums, the Imax, a planetarium and all that stuff. My kidlet told me later that night that she had an absolute blast hanging out with them. Later that evening they met me for dinner which happened to be on the day of my interview and then we retired to the lobby of their hotel while Gary restrung her new guitar with some nylon strings he bought for her and showed her how to use the electric tuner he also bought her. Then they had a few lessons which I managed to capture  urlLink here  :)  Unfortunately after that they had to get going to the reunion but yesterday as they passed through my town on their way back to Montana we were able to see them again for a quick coffee. And now today I find myself really missing them and wishing they lived closer or we lived closer. I'd like to get to know his daughter better because from what I know of her, she's a pretty incredible kid - a music wiz, a science wiz, wants to be a published novelist before she turns 21... I think that's really cool.  The other times we met Gary for a quick dinner and a stroll through a park it was really nice and all but I didn't have the feeling afterwards that I do now. Maybe because we simply didn't have a lot of time to really get to know each other in person and even though chatting online is nice and convenient - it's still just not the same as being there.  Anyway I'd better wind this up. I thought I'd write about it because you always see those long-lost reunions on TV where the reunited family members greet each other after years apart, or after meeting for the first time but you never get to really know what happens after that initial meeting. So this was my story :)"
459925,3751152,2004-08-01,"CamdenTown is a part of London which became famous in the sixties and was a regular hang-out for lotsa rock stars. Since then it's become a place which attracts all manner of freaks (as well as plenty of tourists) coming to embrace Camden's alternative feel and shop in the markets. So I guess it was only natural that my first encounter with Camden would be at a TCZ meet back in 1997.  Well 7 years on here I am living in Camden - having been here for over a year and much as I love where I live, there's one small part of Camden that REALLY riles me up. It's a small stretch of road starting at Camden Tube and progressing about 200-300 metres up towards Camden lock. This is where the markets are and many, many shops selling things like clothes, shoes, tattoos and food (including magic mushrooms). And it's on this small stretch of road that a large number of people descend every weekend - so many people that they have to close Camden tube on a Sunday to make it exit only.  Now I don't mind lots of people, I've had to catch the tram back into Manchester after a United match with about 40,000 other people. What really annoys me is people who seem to have an inability to walk properly or to be aware of everyone around them. These people seem to meander on at a snail's pace obvlivious to those of us who just want to get home. They stop randomly in large groups which means you have to walk in the road just to get past them. Or they decide to stagger themselves right across your path and have a discussion about which shop to go in. They stop to take photos, with the photographer standing like 2 metres away from the photographee and then getting stroppy when people walk in the way. So I'm pretty frustrated by constantly having to negotiate this slalom course of idiots and I'd imagine they all think I have tourettes with the amount of evil glares and muttered curses ;)  And then, when I've just about made it to Camden lock I have to endure the drunk punks, the leafleters, the weed salesmen and today a nice man selling what initially looked like cakes his grandma had made - how sweet I thought, having only baked some fairy cakes myself yesterday. Well, I'm sure you can guess, these cakes would have you seeing more than fairies! His selling slogan was ""Hash cakes - get seriously fucked up for only a pound"".  So welcome to my world, and the small part of it that can seriously piss me off within seconds. But much as I hate this part of Camden, I know one day I'll be grateful when I'm going to a fancy dress party where the theme is goth/punk/freak - I know I'll definitely be able to get an outfit ;)"
459926,3751152,2004-08-01,"So as I write this blog, daylight is rapidly disappearing, but definitely not the activity with it outside.  For this is the Swiss National Day, or as it seems for all the neighbor kids, fireworks day.  Actually, many did not wait till today. I heard many a firework exploding last night as well as throughout the day. But only now is it getting really loud.  Surprisingly, it does not seem that much different than the USA 4th, but instead of red, white, and blue, there are only the first two colors.  The Swiss channels are filled with music from the 4 different cultural areas of Switzerland.  Throughout the mountains, one can probably see many a bonfire.  I'm not Swiss of course, so for me its a manner of curiousity.  Perhaps a bit of annoyance, in that its a holiday that I don't get off as I work in Liechtenstein, and only live in Switzerland, but it doesn't really matter as it fell on a Sunday this time.  Incidently, I don't get the Liechtenstein holiday off either in 2 weeks as it will be on a Sunday as well. Oh well.  So how am I spending my Swiss Day?  Doing nothing..or close to it.  I woke up with a back ache that was most likely caused by my running down a mountain on Saturday at full speed. Thus, it was filled with me playing the odd computer game and lots of television, including 3 hours worth of East Enders on BBC Prime.  Amazing, how I managed to get myself hooked to that series.  So, a week from now I shall be at BOMO if all goes to plan.  It should be a nice change of place from the Swiss way of things :)"
473467,2240106,2004-05-30,"hrm...I'm bored. Yup,you got that right, I'm bored. I jux realize I've got a very passionate boyfriend, passionate about music that is. Once he starts playing he practically forgets the whole world except his music. Sometimes  I really can't help but wonder if this is a good thing or a bad thing. Well, no matter wad, I love him still. I guess this was why I was attracted to him on the first place, his passion for much and the way he interprets it is really beautiful, he's got a beautiful mind although it gets a little crowd at times and I can't read into it but still I think its beautiful... =)oh man, I miss him........  anyway, enough of him. I was reading this book on Chinese history just a while ago before I came online(the translated and shortened version that is...)and sad as this is gonna sound. I found it rather absurd, the Confucius part that is. I mean I'm a history student by choice and I love reading up about it. I haven't studied history in depth (well, they dun offer it to poly students...)but I did do it for 4 years and I'm a pretty good history student(I think...). I've read about historical events of the world since I'm in primary school man! History is the story about dead people but it is also a lesson learned and trialed by time. Well, I'm moving away from wad I wanted to start tying about about in the first place so, uh hrm, I'm back.   as I was saying, I was reading up about the history of china from the beginning to the three kingdoms. I gotta say, I found it very interesting except for the part that Confucius had in the place of Chinese history. China's history is the history of the world. Its dynasty rises and falls and it has gone through more battles and treachery than most of the western countries have gone through or encountered, I can proudly say, I'm proud of the rich history I have as a Chinese but the part where Confucius came in really sucked man! He set up some rules and protocols governing the way of life of the people that (I believe anyway...) totally made life unbearable. What Confucius had in china was what Stalin had created for Lenin, a cult culture. Thankfully he didn't do it on purpose or for his own gain or the consequences would have been unthinkable...But still, oh gosh! Emperors followed his ideas blindly and so fervently that the absurdity and stupidity of the whole idea simply astonished me. A lot of Confucius ideas were on the individual's role and responsibility in society. Men are suppose to work and support the family while the wives stay at home and have no life of their own. Their whole life is dedicated to their parents, siblings, husband then children. She had no life of her own, her whole life revolved around others. Their male counterparts role is about the same except that he had to provide for the family as well and more emphasis was placed on filial piety. There was an incident cited in the book that really struck me. a soldier deserted his camp 3 times so that he could go home to look after his father was praised by his officials for his filial piety while the others that died in his place received none of that. Now, imagine this, what if half of the active serving troops decide to desert camp for the same reason? Who the hell would be left to fight the ongoing war? If there aren't enough people serving in the frontlines, everyone else back home would probably get slaughtered after the invasion and life of a thousand would be lost because of these 'filial' sons, what good is filial piety if you're probably gonna die for it? And need I remind you, this happened during the Spring and Autumn period. It was a time of war and turbulence. Can u imagine if that is to be applied into today's life? =S   sadly, I can't totally disagree with Confucius. His ideas formed the very basis of the Chinese lifestyle and beliefs. Without him, I(we) probably won't be what we are today. His ideas suited the people and leaders then. It was something different and most importantly, it gave them a sense of direction and purpose. When war has ended, soldiers had have nothing more to look out for, families have nothing to fear or worry about anymore, not that people especially loved war and unrest, everybody looks forward to peace and prosperity but when one suddenly has nothing to think or worry about, life suddenly becomes aimless. Confucius ideas were the basic building blocks of many dynasties. It gave the rulers and the people something to work on and believe in rather than have to start everything right from scratch. Its not that easy. One's culture and beliefs takes time to form, like civilisations but dynasties some and go, they fall and they rise again. They get replaced by something else more sophisticated each time before time catches up and modernisation takes place, replacing dynasties with communism, socialism, capitalism so on and so forth. But if u'd look back carefully, maybe you'd realize what we have today was built on what was lost yesterday. The very basis of our ways of governing, yes is more up to date and more humane but if you take away the modern terms and facades, one might find himself/herself face to face with a method or way of government that has existed way before the word democracy even came about.   I guess what I'm trying to put across here is that to some people, history is just the study of events and people(mostly dead) of the past. It holds no link or reference to the modern world we live in, therefore a useless subject(as some of my friends and relatives have said..."" might as well study geography! More use !"") but don't forget, if not for yesterday, there might be no tomorrow, don't take your own history for granted, you are what you are today because of what happened yesterday."
473468,2240106,2004-05-27,"i'm worried about wendy. she's entering depression again and its not good... feels like me all over again and i feel so helpless because i can't help her. i know myself, i know i've got a slight case of depression but i have Mun to be there for me, i can tell him anything and i'm stronger, i can mentally convince myself that things are gonna be ok but she can't. she's really not as strong as everybody thinks. people tend to make wendy out to be some kinda wonderwoman, the kind that nothing can get her down. its onli when u see her in her weakest moments that u'll know she's not that strong, she's actually pretty fragile. i promised her mom to look after her, make sure she eats and dun do anything silly but right now at this moment i dunno wad to do! ARGH !!!! its frustrating u know? i want so DARN MUCH to help her but its almost like the more i reach out the more she runs back into her shelter, worse still, this shelter isn't a very strong one lo.... how?? can anyone tell me how? i'm really worried lei...she smiles but inside its killing her to do so but she puts up this front so that people won't worry what she don't know is that is makes us worry more........not that alot of people know abt though. how?????"
473469,2240106,2004-05-24,"Yes! I'm here to fufill my vow of updating my blog more frequently... Dunno how long I can keep this up though...Ha. Anyway, nothing much happened today. In fact, it was so boring I thought I could die! Argh...I simply surprised myself by not going out today (a first in many days...) this came about really, as an incredible feat especially if you know me. I'm the kinda person who can hardly keep still and yet I managed to force myself to sit infront of the computer rather than pick up my bag and go out. Yes, my day was simply spent in front of the computer, at home. WOW! Oh man, one more day like this and I think I'm gonna die! ArGh....  But I guess its worth it, provided my videos finish downloading by tmr that is. Otherwise I think I just might go nuts. Yes, I spent the whole day downloading songs that I thought of using for my auditions for the Singapore Idol thingy...Ha! Yup, I signed up for the competition. Hey, I know that there is this terribly high chance that I might jux be the next William Hung but WHO CARES! I mean look at it this way, its a once in a lifetime thingy man! I know I'm never gonna get the chance to do it again if I missed this chance. Who the heck would want an 80 year old granny as their Singapore Idol?? Yeah, its that kinda thing u know. To do it once and get over it, so that you wun have any regrets later on in life. Who knows? Maybe there ARE people who are totally tone deaf but are having the Idol dream? As pit against them I'm pretty sure I'll fare well lo...I'm actually a pretty good singer depending on my mood that is. Who knows? There are a thousand and one possibilities to a single situation, so y not just give it a try? Even if I do end up in the blobbers segment, I would rest in peace knowing that I've done my best AMEN! I guess I'll survive just fine, I mean what's there to fear? I know I'm gonna have Wendy there to support me (oh yeah, she's taking part too!! YEAH!!) and a whole bunch of pals at home waving their pom-poms, drumming up a song of victory and courage for the both of us so yeah, I think we're gonna do just fine if u know what I mean...  My Simpson fever has just reached a new height upon the discovery of the Simpson video online and as I'm typing this entry, my computer is busily trying to cope with the amount of Simpson video I've lined up to be downloaded. Its really quite scary judging by the number of remotely queued videos I've got but hey, how often is it that I would actually sit down and do this? Once in a blue moon lo...Its not that often that my boyfriend falls sick and I've got no one to hang out with...OOPS! Did I let the cat of the bag?? Hehe....Ok ok, maybe I had an ulterior motive for staying at home but the thing that really matters here is still that I stayed at home rite? I'm not the bad girl that everyone makes me out to be, I can be homely and stay at home too wad....hehe I'm starting to get bored, none of the videos wish to finish downloading...which translate to mean I'm probably not gonna get to watch them tonite. Oh yeah, did i mention i'm also downloading some episodes of the Charmed series? Yeah, so Kel? If u want them jux let me know and i'll send it over... Oh ya, i finally found The Nightmare Before Christmas too! But i'm not too sure if its gonna be the full movie or not. if its the full movie, i'm so gonna ask wendy to burn it for me man! i've looked all over Singapore for a copy of it but yes, to no avail. They've onli got it on DVD(i dun have a player at home tat supposrts it) but its all sold out lor! Or i would have bought it and dropped by my friend's place to watch it... ArGh.... Hrm...i think that's enuf grumbling for a day besides, i wanna go watch Jurassic Park le. So here's to u blog, GOOD NITE AND GOOD BYE!"
473470,2240106,2004-05-23,"alot of stuff happened since i last entered my blog entry. well, one thing that i'm most happy about is that my boyfriend's back!! haha...i'm like 10 thousand times happier now than before. one thing that i've learnt from all this is that i'm not good at communicating and that i'm too insecure. i keep too many things to myself and in process i make the life of those who care pretty hard. and more than often, its because of the failure to communicate that relationships fall apart. mine was slightly different though. mine was a combination of both i guess. i keep alot of things to myself, its not that i dun wanna tell people about it, its jux that i dunno how to say it. everytime something happens the first person i think of is Mun, there are so many things i wanna say and do with him but it seems that when i see him, i dunno where to start and in the end i just give up. i'll just forget about it. no, forgetting isn't the word to use, i'm just putting them aside for the time being before it resurfaces. it seems that it hurts to not be able to share the problems and happiness of the ones u love. i realize how much i've hurt the very people who love me the most."

To get ur body in this really super hyper and tired state then things seem to become so much simpler. so i did, i got myself totally soaked and tired out, actually all 3 days of orientation had been totally tiring but i guess it was fun la...i got tot know my class mates lo..haha. not all of them i like though...i don't like nicole and desmond for starters. they both got attitude sia! nicole has this unbearable air around her that really makes her irritating. her refusal to participate in the activities din help either, she's always so bz clicking away on her mobile and well, just irritating lo! =S desmond wasn't any better, he's very rude and totally no respect for the rest of the class. he doesn't help out during activities either and well, like nicole just plain attitude and irritating!! well, whatever lo. dun step on my toes or i'll make sure u regret ever knowing me lo. when i bitch, i'll go all out one so dun start me."
473473,2240106,2004-06-13,"He...Just realize I haven't been updating my blog again lately... So I guess I'm back!   well, a lot of things happened this few weeks that I was away from my blog, so much that I dun really know where to start blogging about. First up, to everyone who have been messaging me but not receiving a reply, I'm really sorry guys, my phoneline got cut. Guess my dad failed to pay his part of the bill again...Well, wad to do? Anyway, where did I stop the last time? The Singapore idol part rite? Yeah, I think so. Well, lets see...I finally got in touch with this primary school friend of mine after a really long time. She's currently in India, waiting to do her A' levels. Her birthday's on the 4th of July(I almost forgot about that..) and yeah, I received her email last night and I managed to pull my fingers to work and typed her a pretty long mail updating her on my current happenings for the past 3 months?? hahaha...Not an easy task I tell you... I haven't seen mum in a week already and I miss him so badly but no matter how bad I know its probably never gonna be as bad as how much wendy's missing kailun.     I HATE tHAT GUY!!!    he went to cathay when Wendy was working with this dumb bitch lor and I guess it really got on wendy's nerves. She broke down and called me(I was sleeping at that moment...)and started sobbing. I mean, fuck him la! I really didn't have a bloody clue as in to what she wants me to do lor. He's a fucking asshole and she knows that, we(kel and I) warned her about him and giving him another chance again but she didn't quite register our words and now this. What do you want me to do? No, put it this way, what the fucking hell can I do? I wanna kick his ass lor but I'm not there and he's probably not worth the effort. Who would be happy to hear something like that happen? Especially when you've already predicted the ending but no one gave a damn about it. So fine, I let you go ahead and do what you think is right and best for you. Hey, its your life man! I'm in no control of it, I dun want to be. So yeah, I let her go do what she wants and when she got hurt she came back to me, I didn't mind that part seriously, I dun mind that at all. She's almost like a sister to me, I'll die for her if I had to but what can I do? I'm at home, she's at work, crying for some asshole that nobody really likes. Worse still, why is she crying? cause'he went to the movies with a pretty girl. Well, told you it was gonna happen. Been there, done that. Then what happen, she said she tink she called the wrong person, I got admit, I didn't sound like I cared but you know what? You needed to talk so I let you, what am I to do? I can feel this thing boiling inside of me, if I actually spoke more than what I did that day I'd probably end up scolding her and when I say scold I really mean it. Its probably gonna make her feel 10x worse lor, so why bother? Lets just say I'm not exactly the best kinda friend you'd wanna have lo. In fact, I think I'm a lousy person altogether. I believe in letting people do what they wanna do and hopefully they'll learn their lesson from there.    give a man a fish, it'll feed him for a day.  teach a man to fish, it'll feed him a lifetime.   so yeah, that's what I did but more than often I get blamed for allowing things to happen although I knew it was gonna happen. I get blamed for leaving people in the lurch and not being the sympathic friend. Well, guess what? Its ok, I'm used to it! Blame me for all the fucking problems you have, for not being understanding, for not knowing sympathy etc etc etc...I'm used to it. I'm fine with it. I live my whole darn fucking life for others. I've lived my whole life trying to be what others want me to be but know what? I never quite make the cut. I love my friends, I'd make myself look bad if it makes them look or feel good but you know what? Its still not quite good enough. I dunno what else to do...or maybe I should just stop doing anything, I should just stop trying, I know its definitely gonna make my life a lot easier..."

481618,3751913,2004-08-05,"Here I am in gorgeous Shanghai. This is fucking awesome. But first things first. ...and now, a minute by minute account of the past 14 hours of my life... At check in, we were told that the probability of Alex and my being upgraded was high. We were instructed to wait to board, and if spaces were still available in Business Class, we'd get them. Long story short; they weren't. We angrilly flew coach and I decided to entertain myself by detailing the hell I knew I was about to endure. 2:15pm PST, We're scheduled to take off now. Why aren't we? The movies are 50 First Dates, Hidalgo, and Shrek 2. Um, no thanks. 2:45pm, Fuck You United. I'm listening to an electronic device during take off. 3:03pm, Take off 3:15pm, fill out foreign entry cards, befriend gay steward, Jason, whom I now love. 3:25pm, start drinking shitty wine. (Brooks Hollow cabernet. Beware!) I bet they have better wine in Biz. Class. 3:51pm, start to pretend I'm on my own private plane, jetsetting across the globe. Alex wants to know why I'm still wearing sunglasses as I read Elle. 5:30pm, Extreme boredom setting in. Mom stopped by to rub in coach. Mix of Vallium and wine making me begin to cry at Avril Levigne (sp?) song? Worrisome. 6:15pm, I hate all music. I've read my Elle twice and am too antsy to read my book. Sent Dad to get us Biz. Class snacks. Are we there yet? Starting to hate those around me. 6:20pm, Dad brought us cheese and grape plate. Consumed in 2 minutes as we didn't want to get caught with fancy snacks. I wonder what all my friends are doing? 6:31pm, have become fascinated by cheapest pillow in the history of air travel. 6:35pm, I'm starting to hate my outfit. 7:15pm, Dad appears with sandwiches, chips, and Toblerone. Fuckin' Biz Class. 8:00pm, disccovered Chinese man across from Alex reading United's copies of Ebony and Shape En Espanol. Curious. 8:25pm, Jason the steward stopped by with a list of great places in Shanghai and Beijing for pearls, knock offs, and cheap massages. Fabulous. 9:00pm, bizarre snack of Chinese Cuo O' Noodles, mini-apple, and short bread. Gave Alex gross soup. I hope Dad keeps the snack train coming. 9:10pm, forced to tackle stewardess for coffee. I bet they have biscotti in Biz Class. 9:28, Alex is fascinated with woman across from him who keeps staring in his direction. We've decided to actively spy on her and the Ebony guy, who seem to have become friends. Seats 61 H and J. 9:40, addition of coffee to system has me on speed-like high. Convinced I should get a Scissor Sisters logo tattoo somewhere on me. This is the greatest album I've ever heard in my life. 9:43, So Bored and can't see the video screen. 61 H and J are now networking with those around them. 9:50, Fuck Biz Class. Equality, not Economy! 10:00, on a Friday night. I could be at The Redwood Room having not only fun, but sufficient legroom. 10:05, show big map on screen. 4 and a half hours till Shanghai. We're past the international dateline and nearing Japan. Okay. This is cooler than The Redwood Room. 10:59, starting to get noticeably horrible. Craning neck to see Shrek 2. Air conditioning blowing in my face. Been here for 9 hours. Oh god. I actually just drooled on myself. 11:46, nearing Japanese coast. We're going 565 mph. Less than 3 hours left. Dad came by with more provisions from civilization, including cheddar cheese and jelly beans. I feel sick. 12:25amPST, somewhere over Tokyo. Hour 10 of flight. Ready to parachute out of here. 12:26, Why are they showing the safety video again? Getting second wind. 12:32, Second wind gone. 12:40, Alex is asleep with his mouth open and I'm tempted to put things in it. Is physical pain worth a chuckle? Let's see...Yes! It is. I have the hardcore giggles now. Putting pens in Alex's mouth. In hysterics. Alex still asleep. Never been one for such cheesy comedy. Must be delirium. But that doesn't mean I'll stop. Feeling very obnoxious. More so than usual. Must cause trouble. 1:03, did my shower, tooth brush, hair styling, re-make up in the potty. Peeked out window at Japam below. Looks as I remeber it. 1:25, This food is appalling. Some kind of pasta with red sauce, random melon, and shitty cookie. 2:00am PST (5pm Shanghai.) 15 hours ahead. 45 minutes till landing. Oh god. They're about to spray us with bugkiller. Alex is taking pictures. 2:25am, descending! Over East China Sea. I never heard of East China Sea. 15 more minutes! Some one just applied a gallon of cologne. Damn you, Duty Free... 2:40, Alex pipes up, ""It looks like rice paddies."" All flight attendants congratulating us for surviving coach, especially Jason. Alex wonders aloud how gays always find me immediately. I'm blessed, I guess. 2:45am, (5:45pm Shanghai time) Touchdown. Holy Shit, we're in China. We were met at the airport by Rei, our fabulous little guide. We made it to this gorgeous hotel within and hour of landing and are getting ready to go to the Grand Hyatt's ""Canton"" for some swanky dinner. It's 5am to me right now. And I'm not that tired. Although a little dazed. But, hells bells, y'all. I made it. Gotta run. I think they're changing me a limb per minute."
481619,3751913,2004-08-05,"I'm getting excited. In 27 hours, I'll be on a plane bound for Shanghai. Red China. The People's Republic. Oppressors of Tibet. Makers of knock-off designer bags. China. Similar to Home Alone, mom and pop are flying Business Class and Alex and I are waitlisted. If we can't upgrade, we'll fly 12 and a half hours in steerage, with the goats and the chickens. Do they even have seatbelts back there? Although, my beloved sibling pointed out that at least the booze is free on international flights. (He's his mother's son.) I have been an indentured servant to any miles plus program, and have thus been able to upgrade consistently. I think the last time I flew coach, the inflight movie was Dick Tracy. (Speaking of which, as a nerdy aside, did you know that Benicio Del Torro's ""Fenster"" in The Usual Suspects was an homage to Dustin Hoffman's ""Mumbles"" in Dick Tracy?) A little business to attend to, as this is my form of communication to everyone I know. 1. Bonnie has our contact info. If someone dies, tell her and she'll tell us. 2. We sent out the Evite for our huge Anniversary Extravaganza. If you read this, you're so invited. Email me and I'll add you to the list. 3. The next time you hear from me, I'll be in China, filling you in on the hilarity, tragedy, and constant fighting that makes up Spotswood Family International Travel. I hope mother packed the Vallium. No one's allowed to have any fun while I'm gone.  Beth Spotswood has left the country..."
481620,3751913,2004-08-04,"...when Bon and I posted our craigslist ad on Valentine's Day. We were cracking ourselves up last night recalling our adventures, and we are desperate to find that ad. I can't believe we didn't save it. For those of you who don't know the legendary Valentine's Day story of 2004, let me enlighten you. This past Valentine's Day, Bon and I found ourselves home with no dates and nothing to do. This struck us as ridiculous. Seriously. It was a crime. We woke up and wandered around the flat, moaning and bitching about this stupid holiday that no one really likes anyway. Finally, we decided, ""Fuck it."" Bonnie went into the kitchen to stir up some alcoholic brew at 11am, and I went in my room to create my costume. When I emerged, Bonnie caught on fast and went into her room to change as well. By noon, we were both drunk, wearing pink lingerie, little black cardigans, high heels, with flowers in our hair and crazy make-up. It is at this point, that we decided it'd be a good idea to explain our situation to the world and post an ad on Craigslist. The ad went a little something like this: We're so bored this Valentine's Day that we're....already drunk! We're 2 twenty-something vixens who are baffled by the fact that we don't have dates. Thus, we've dressed up in ridiculous lingerie inspired outfits, inebriated ourselves, and are looking for love in all the wrong places. We look like an episode of Oprah gone awry. The men in the white coats are not far off. Rescue us. B+B We received 132 responses. With 2 computers set up on the sun porch, we set to the task of narrowing our options. Bon created various folders in our joint e-mail account, entitled: Mr. Right, Possibly, Not So Much, Naked Boys, and Never. Needless to say, when you announce that you and your girlfriend are drunk, wearing pink lacey slips, and lookinâ for action, you get a myriad of replies, mostly of the dirty variety. With a mixture of vodka, lemonade, and crushed fresh strawberries (to make it pink, of course), we came to a list of about 5 possibilities, including one guy who just wanted to come over and watch us get ready to go out. He was hot, but creepy. He got moved into the Not So Much category. I spent a bit of time e-mailing back and forth with 2 Australian guys in town to sell copy machine products. They seemed cute, friendly, and funny. We agreed. Australians it would be. Once we decided we were actually going to meet these 2 guys, we got all hysterical and excited. âOh my god. Are we really doing this?â âFuck yes, weâre really doing this. Go put on slutty clothes.â We decided to meet them in North Beach, and nervously got in a cab. We were kind of early, so we sat at the bar and drank. Suddenly, in walks this guy that is obviously one of the Australians. He is Kym, and his friend Ben is parking. Ben finally arrives, we all find a table, and start to talk. Theyâre adorable! Theyâre nice and funny and not at all gross. Theyâre incredibly chivalrous, touchy feely, and super cute. Plus, those accents. We hit a few bars before they propose dinner. Um, dinner? Okay. We go to some romantic Italian place and have a marvelous time, with Bonnie and I kicking each other under the table through most of the meal. At around midnight, we head over to Cappâs, and grab some more drinks. By closing time, weâre delightedly drunk and ready to head home. We thank them for a lovely time, kiss them goodbye, hop in a cab, and erupt into hysterics. We could not have had a better time with anyone else. Kym and Ben rock. The next day, the called just to make sure we got home okay. Yeah, guys. Weâre really fucking okay. Viva Australia!"
481621,3751913,2004-08-03,"Bon and I just got back from dinner at Foreign Cinema. We split the cheapest bottle of red they had and ended up having an in depth discussing on sex. We were laughing so hard, I think we offended the next table, but screw them. They were French. Our waiter (also French) was a total asshole, and I think he was silently judging us. Whatever. You can take my dirty plate away now, you frog. I returned home to an e-mail from my friend Christine who was worried that there'd be no blog updates while I'm in China. Fear not. It's the land of technology. I'll be filling everyone in on my adventures near daily. I hear they have a wall there. I'll be sure to tell you guys all about it."
481622,3751913,2004-08-02,"I'm currenly reading 3 books, one of which is an attempt to re-read the origional Les Miserables in French (I'm on page 4). The others are trashy, drugstore novels that cost nickels and I secretly love. Today, upon reading the following passage, I finally decided that I can no longer consider myself an intellectual snob and it turns out, I'm just as stupid as everyone else, if not stupider.  ""Fuck English in the ass with a hydrochloric acid dildo. The wave of the future is science."""

481624,3751913,2004-08-01,"Last night, I watched Tom Cruise: Inside the Actorâs Studio. Oh. My. God. What a freak.  Have I told you my theory about huge, international celebrities? I maintain, that once you reach a certain level of celebrity, you begin to lose your gauge of whatâs normal and whatâs not. So many people fawn over every little thing you say, you can basically do no wrong, and people always laugh at your jokes. You have no gauge of when youâre being funny or not, when you sound smart or not, when youâre making an ass of yourself to us regular people, because you are surrounded (whether you want to be or not) by people who do nothing but kiss your ass. I have 3 excellent examples of this. 1. My friend Lauren is currently an actress in LA. Prior to this, she was an actress in New York. While there, she appeared as slut #2 in a Ricky Martin video. She found herself filming a scene in a nightclub, squished into a booth with Ricky and some other skanks, and having to talk to Ricky in between takes. He spoke of Puerto Rico and his love for water. At one point, a production assistant piped up and said, âOh Ricky. I love water, too.â Ricky high fives this jackass, and the entire nightclub applauds. 2. While watching a âMaking of The Gladiatorâ on HBO, I observed Russell Crowe (thatâd be Oscar winning Russell Crowe) wandering around the set pretending his sword was a penis. This is in the background, while the director is being interviewed. When itâs finally Russellâs turn to be interviewed, he cracks some off-color jokes to the dead silence around him. He then spits, gets up, and walks away. 3. Finally, we come to the great Kevin Spacey, who has so many gauge infractions, I donât know where to begin. At a televised tribute to the Beatles, he performed âMind Gamesâ onstage (entirely solo), while sweating and dancing around like a drunk uncle at a wedding. I could see him at some meeting months before, coming up with this grand scheme to show off his skills, and no one, not even his closest advisors, had the balls to say, âUh, Mr. Spacey. Perhaps thatâs not the best idea.â Worse, recently, he was cruising some gay park in London at 4am, let some tweaker steal his cell, called the cops and said he was mugged, and then called back and said, nope, actually I gave some tweaker my phone. I lied before. âOh, no problem, Mr. Spacey. We all understand. (snicker, snicker.)â  The point is, at a certain level, you can no longer tell what is acceptable behavior and what is not, because you have an entourage of 27 people who give you a standing ovation every time you take a shit. Tom Cruise has reached that point. Last night, on Inside the Actorâs Studio, I became so embarrassed for him, I was forced to change the channel. I took notes. Hold on. Iâll get them. Fist of all, heâs taller than James Lipton, which letâs you know how fucking short Lipton is. Interesting. Tom has trouble answering direct questions. When asked about childhood financial hardships early in the interview, Tom goes off into this diatribe about how those hardships build character and gets all philosophical, to the point of not making sense. Shut up, Tom. We just wanted to hear about how you had to gut fish or clean train station bathrooms. Save the propaganda for the Q&A. And talk about father issues. When asked why he changed his name, he practically hit James Lipton for suggesting he wanted to disassociate himself from his father. After 10 minutes of ass kissing and coddling, Tom says he changed his name because he wanted to disassociate himself from his father. Hello? Every question sent him off into some intense personal place of incoherent justification of god knows what. He rambles and pontificates and never comes to a point. (Yeah, I know, I know. Shut the fuck up.) Of course, they touch on the movies that Tom wants to talk about. Sure, thereâs no mention of Losinâ It or All the Right Moves. But no Cocktail? Come on! We spend 45 minutes on Vanilla Sky, and no fucking Cocktail? Thatâs a bunch of malarkey. The thing is, even though Tom Cruise is practically from another planet, itâs not really his fault. He became a superstar at 21, and as we all know, 21 year old men are very, very stupid. So, people have been telling him heâs a genius since then. Plus, look at him. My god, heâs glowing. They showed all kinds of baby pictures, and Tom was a strikingly good looking toddler. Heâs gorgeous, and even though he makes no sense and can barely function, heâs so fucking beautiful, you just smile and nod along with everyone else. Keep talking, pretty boy. We donât care about what youâre saying, we just want to see those teeth. I would just like to take this opportunity to say that you fine people have no problem telling me when Iâm making an ass of myself. When Iâm a huge, international celebrityâ¦you can all kiss my ass like crazy. Iâm going to dress like a drag queen and publicly sing and pretend my sword is a penis. Why? Because I can, thatâs why. Isnât that the whole point of being famous?"
481625,3751913,2004-08-01,"9:30. A&E. Watch it.  (I'll be having dinner at the Buckeye, which, because it's my favorite restaurant, makes missing this glorious occassion slightly bearable. But, I'm taping it. You all need to be ready to discuss tomorrow.)"

481627,3751913,2004-08-01,"Yesterday, Alex, Kelsey, and I saw The Village. And today, I went to an 11am showing of The Manchurian Candidate. Hereâs what I can report: We had heard that the Village is pretty predictable. Everyone always expects M. Night Shyamalan to have some big twisty surprise ending, and he did. Yeah, I called it half way through, but none the less, it was still not horrible. We expected to be scared out of our wits and as we walked into the theater, Kelsey asks the movie staff if the movie is scary. âOh, not as scary as if I were to rip your head off and drink whatâs inside.â Nice. I think I can speak for Kelsey and myself by saying that the highlight of The Village is Joaquin Pheonix. I just want him to come rescue me from perilous situations. Heâs dreamy. The Manchurian Candidate sucked. Seriously. Iâve always been a Liev Schreiber fan (see Daytrippers. Heâs hilarious.) and I truly worship Meryl Streep. One of my favorite things is seeing a movie alone as early in the day as humanly possible. I have never seen the original, so I had nothing to compare it to. I was in the mood for a good thriller. And Jonathan Demme directed one of the greatest movies ever made, Silence of the Lambs. I was anticipating a solid 2 hours of seriously good film. I was totally let down. Keep in mind, I hate Denzel Washington, based mostly on the fact that he was a dick when I saw him on Charlie Rose. And Iâm not a science fiction kind of gal. But this thing was the most anti-climactic experience of my life, and thatâs saying something. I want my cash back. Iâd rather give it to the hobo so he can buy some tuna."

Earlier today, he was given ""National League Player of the Week"" honors with higher than a 1.5 slugging average, .700 on base percentage, and hitting .600 in the time span. Truly remarkable. Tip your hats, you guys.  You are in the presence of a legend.       Okay so some updates about the   non-legandary   me.       Last Thursday Night, one of my oldest friends and his sister came over to spend the night and ended up staying all day Friday too. It was really cool, almost like ole times. Since we only see each other maybe 1-2 times a year, I really value the time I get to spend with the guy. Some funny stuff. Friday night, my grandparents came over, and my friend's parents and we all had dinner together. That also was pretty cool. After they left my dad put on this hindi movie, Lakshya. It was pretty good(at least for the part I watched). One of the songs really struck home.       Saturday, I cleaned my desk. Watched the Giants. Watched the Niners. Slept.       Sunday, we went school shopping and to the temple. I think I saw Sapna in Walmart. lol. At night, I went to my grandma's house to spend the night, and ended up meeting one of my aunties. So another little family reunion there.       Today, I spent the morning running chores for my grandma and trying to avoid my grandpa. Now it's not like I don't love him or anything, I do but sometimes I don't have the strength in me to put up with him. How my grandma does it, I have no idea.       Then around 1, I went to AHS to pick up my maze day packet. Turns out that the office doesn't open til 1:30. So I was just waiting there and I ran into Adrienne. That was cool. lol. We talked and walked a little and then we discovered that Mrs. T was in her room! So we walked in and talked with her for a while. This world needs more teachers like Mrs. T, seriously (not to say there aren't other good teachers at AHS or anything). Frankly, all my classes have had their own story, some good, some not but now that I look back at it, I have no regrets. Okay, so after we hung out at Mrs. T's, I had a ASB meeting to go to concerning primarily major club status for next year. No offense to anyone who might possibly take offense to this, but the meeting was a complete waste of time. I have no problem against major clubs, but at the same time I realize that the chess club will never become one (as a lot of people choose to make fun of during the meeting). Heck for the record, the AHS Chess Club/ Chess Team is   #1   in the Golden State of California. How's that for major?! Laugh all you want. Okay, back to point, major clubs ( or rather having incentive for clubs that do well) is a good idea but the way that it will be implented leaves a lot to be desired. If you do well in the previous year, you will get privledges the next year which you don't necessarily deserve at the time. Lets say for example your the world's best club in 2000, doesn't mean you'll continue to be that great in 2001 but now you have extra fundraising weeks, cash etc etc. I have no problem with clubs duking it out for the title. People seem to forget that this is high school, and we will be   gone   in 1-2 years.  Oh well, not my problem.       What a wonderful world...         Anyways, after the meeting, I was just hanging with people, talking. It was a moment of realization for me. While the summer was really great, today reminded me that the summer is effectively over and not to expect anything to be different. I've learned that what happens over the summer, often times is quickly forgotten once school year starts.       This is the song that I really liked from Lakshya. (the lyrics more importantly) I earlier did a full translation but the stupid server crashed so if anyone wants the full translation its on request. lol.     Main Aisa Kyun Hoon...    Why am I like this?    Main Jaisa Hoon, Main Vaisa Kyon Hoon    Karna Hai Kya Mujhko, Ye Maine Kab Hai Jana    Lagta Hai Gaoonga, Zindagi Bhar Bas Ye Gaana    Hoga Jaane Mera Ab Kya    Koi To Bataye Mujhe    Gadbad Hai Ye Sab Kya    Koi Samjhaye Mujhe    Main Aisa Kyun Hoon...    Main Jais...Kyun Hoon      Ab Mujhko Ye Hai Karna, Ab Mujhe Wo Karna Hai    Aakhir Kyon Main Na Janoon, Kya Hai Ki Jo Karna Hai    Lagta Hai Ab Jo Seedha, Kal Mujhe Lagega Ulta    Dekho Na Main Hoon Jaise, Bilkul Ulta Pulta    Badlonga Main Abhi Kya    Manoon To Kya Manoon Main    Sudhrunga Main Kabhi Kya    Ye Bhi To Na Janoon Main    Jaane Ab Mera Hona Kya    Lagta Hai Tumko Kya    Jaane Ab Mera Hona Kya Hai    Kya Main Hoon, Jaisa Bas Vaisa Rahunga    Karna Hai Kya...Main Ye Gaana    Hoga...Samjhaye Mujhe    Main Aisa Kyun Hoon...    Main Aisa Aisa Aisa Hi Hoon      Oh yeah one last thing: vow to myself. This year I will not hold back. I've waied, and I've second quessed myself for too long. This year will be different."

Michael Philips has more than just lived up to pre-Olympic expectations and even with B-14s parked in thier training facilities, the Iraqi soccer team is shocking the world.

But ya whats kinda makin me mad is that jason isnt even talkin to me and he keeps playin with this msn crap so everytime he signs on this box thing pops up and has a little broken heart thing . uhgg lol <>"
527052,4126520,2004-08-04,"hey guys this is gonna be a pretty boring blog. i didnt do anything today. i sat around, ate, cleaned and talked all day long. pretty boring huh! ya well i dont really have anything to do so? But this weekend should be good!!! yay im excited. finally have some fun. lol. but guess what i shall be leavin soon!!!  kinda for vacation i guess u could call it. like the 20th were leavin to new mexico for like a week and then the day we come back i leave again with my friend RHI!!!!! shes awesome. were like bestest friends. but neways ya were goin to glennwood springs. its pretty fun out there.  omg theres some hott guys! whoa. lol last year i met this one kid. he was so hott. maybe ill get to see him again :) lol but okay im done i just thought id write."
527053,4126520,2004-08-04,"Tonight was the worst night of my entire life. OMG I hate my life it totally sucks so bad. And I messed it up even more. Jason and I had been arguing for a while now and things were getting rough and so frustrating. I've cried my eyes out, screamed my head off, sat here and thought about whats important and what's not. And maybe me and Jason weren't meant to be ya know maybe things just didn't work out the way I planned. And I'm so sad and upset right now. My face burns from crying and my nails are bitten down to the skin, I feel as if I just got pushed down and kicked in the stomach a thousand times. :( I feel like crap that's a good way to put it I guess. I mean I love Jason so much and we had all we needed. It was so awesome; I loved him, he loved me, we loved each other. He was my best friend. He is my best friend. And right now I regret breaking up with him, maybe it will help us both in the end? I hope....I pray!?  I mean I lost everything I cared about everything I loved. I gave up on what little we had left. I didn't know what to do. I was scared. I was lost. I was so confused. And the worst part of it is I don't think he even trusted me when I told him I loved him. I mean it truly hurt me....So bad...So deep. It feels like the world just stopped or life just ended. I mean it sounds stupid I just truly genuinely love him. But I'm gonna try sleeping again I doubt I can but I'm gonna try."
527054,4126520,2004-08-03,"okay, this is my first time doing one of these things so...im going to try to keep up with it.   today im doing absolutely nothing exciting.  I woke up at like 11 i guess or around then just messed around. but im so bored right now i think ill go eat...again. hehe but ya ok. bye"
533702,3697773,2004-06-20,"That is one awesome song.  Everyone, go buy Vendetta's Reds CD.  Yes, it came out last year.  But its great.  And for once, I'm not pushing something for myself.  I don't get points if you go to their site, or money or a special autograph if you buy their CD.  They are simply a really amazing music group.  This is my last pre-vacation entry, so it better be good, eh?  I don't want you to think of me as a loser for the next month.  First off, it's important to wish everyone a Happy Birthday who I will be missing while gone:  Kryzilla, Sam, Josie, Lexi, Courtney, and everyone else.  I love you, I miss you, and I'll make y'all banners when I get back!  Secondly, I got invited to the beach by a hot guy!  Haha, I was at work, eating a strawberry starburst.  He asked me if I wanted to go to the beach, what time was I getting off work?  Too bad I wasn't getting off until four.  Lame post, but whatever.  I'll see you all when I get back.  Email me, darlings!"
533703,3697773,2004-06-20,"Tangerine is such a funny name for a color.  I understand that the color isn't quite orange, but why call it tangerine?  I mean, its something to think about it.  Did the color orange or the fruit orange come first?  Depending on which one did, does that mean that the tangerine was named for the color?  Or the color was named for the fruit?    Now that I've confused everyone, I'd like to show you a picture of the shoes I'd like:      I saw these shoes at Famous Footwear today, and I need them.  Really. Bad.  But, I didn't have any money, and my mom wasn't going to give me a cash advance.  I never seem to remember whether I paid her or not when she does that, and most of the time, I think I pay her back twice.  Not fun.  But, I'm getting a paycheck two days after I come back from vacation, and I should have around 16 hours on it.  Which is nice.  And then I'll go back and buy them.  Because I seriously doubt they'll be sold out.  I showed them to my grandma, and I could tell she thought I was joking:  ""Grandma, look!""  This is Cindie, trying to bond with her Grandma.  Yes, I shouldn't have picked shoes as a topic, but so?  ""Oh?""  ""Don't you like them?""  ""Do you?""  ""Um, yeah.""  Can you feel the air coming out the bubble that just burst?  ""They're...bright.""  Yay."
533704,3697773,2004-06-20,"I can't think of a creative title for this one.  Maybe it will come to me as I write it.  My dad is watching ""The Others"" right now.  He's had it on every time its been on.  Considering the fact that it's been on TNT about 460286082 times in the past week, it's a pretty safe assumption to say he's seen the whole thing.  Yet, he watches on.  And yes, this  is  coming from the girl that has watched bits and pieces of Miracle for a record eight days straight.  Oops, I'm a hypocrite.  I finally told the last person I wanted to tell that I'm going away on vacation.  I feel incredibly stupid doing so, but there was no way around it.  So I made up some crap story about my aunt staying over my house for the month, so that she doesn't go tell all her friends ""Hey, Cindie's house is empty for the month, lets party, crash, and take all her music because we're  evil "".  Fun.  I can see it happening too.  The Mets are on.  They are over .500, and I'm so proud of them.  No, I don't know any of them personally, but I hate seeing them lose.  And I know that when you're a fan, you don't want to see your team lose, that kind of goes hand in hand, but its always heartbreaking and I wish I could do something about it.  So, yeah, its good that they're winning now.  I wish other people would just shut their mouths about them now.  Hmm, I guess I should mention the fact that HPB is down, again.  It'll more than likely be up again in July, but I won't be there, so that kind of annoys me.  I don't want to miss a months worth of things, I don't want to miss any games, I don't want to miss SSW.  But, there isn't a gosh darn thing I can do about it.  I'm just mad I can't get online to switch my signature so people know I'm gone, and that I haven't abandoned the boards.  Hopefully they'll be able to figure that out on their own, though.  We're a pretty smart bunch ;).  While uploading songs onto my iPod, I've discovered a whole bunch of music that I don't listen to anymore.  Take Rubyhorse, for example.  I can't remember the last time I listened to that CD.  I don't think I've ever listened to the entire thing.  But I'm now addicted to it.  And ""Dream On"", haha."
533705,3697773,2004-06-20,"Important Note:  I wrote this yesterday night upstairs, so yeah, its all past tense.  I'm not crazy.  My dad got his GPS system today, and so begins the love affair that tears my family apart.  For example, he is now, downstairs, on our family computer, downloading maps and spazzing out on a message board about it.  Cough, no, I don't  spaz  on message boards.  But then again, I don't go on fun ones that deal with global positioning devices.  Did I mention he's waited two weeks for this thing?  And that he was so obsessed over getting it, he went after the FedEx truck that turned down the other street to get it?  It turned out it wasn't in that truck anyway.  So, he called and complained, and said ""UPS always gets me my packages fast.""  Ouch.  He had to drive me to work today, and he's only gotten it an hour or so before.  They sent it out on another truck.  Thank goodness, because I think if we had to wait one more day, he would have exploded.  The whole thing would have been very Harry Potter of him.  Maybe, if I'm lucky, and it does happen, a funky Knight Bus will come and rescue me from the insanity that is my family, and Commack in general.  He decided this fun, new, GPS system was much more important than his worn out, tired daughter, who needed to get to work in one piece, if possible.  He brought it in the car, because he doesn't drive me to Michael's  every other day , so he couldn't possibly locate it.  He kept staring at it, and finally I took it, hid it on the other side of me, and he couldn't look at it.  Forgive me for wanting to remain alive in the ten minute car ride.  Apparently that is too much to ask.  When he picked me up from work, I was less than happy to see it sitting there, staring at me.  Yes, it won, we know, enough.  And so, its all ""I got it to work!"", and I'm kind of exhausted from standing around doing nothing for half an hour because CJ won't let us leave.  Standing still is more tiring than walking, it's been scientifically proven.  But I have to sit there with this ugly piece of black machinery (with color LCD display!), and follow us home on it.  Joy.  One good thing did come of it, however.  On the way home, we discovered the name of the street that has no name.  Yup, its all out of that U2 song, or whoever ripped off Bono's voice.  Not sure if it is actually U2.  This street has one house, really deep in the trees, and no one ever goes near it.  For all we know, no one lives there.  But, apparently, it has a name.  And this name is so important to me that I forgot it already.  Something with an M.  Righty-o.  I also came up with a stupid idea in which I'm going to use on this new, fun, funky, uberly awesome blog:  a weekly column highlighting the randomness of me.  It'll be called ""The Row"", because that is a fun name for a column, and yeah, it'll be fun!  Watch for it on Friday.  It might involve cars, it might not.  It will involve scrapbooking wizards, which is always fun.  And, more than likely, there will be the mention of hockey.  Brace yourselves.  Who cares if the season is over?"
533706,3697773,2004-06-20,"Yes, thats right, I do consider myself a fangirl.  Not in all respects.  I know I went to the world premiere of PoA, but I wouldn't have gone had it not been for the fact that I also wanted to meet up with people.  I am, however, incredibly and publicly obsessed with Michael Mantenuto.       Yes, I'm cool like that.    Anyways, to get on with my story, I decided to watch the commentary on Miracle.  Its between Gavin O'Connor (the director) and two other people who aren't important enough to remember.  So, they're talking, and we get to the scene where its Jack O'Callahan (aka Michael Mantenuto, der) and Herb Brooks on the big Olympic ice rink.  And they're talking, and he flashes the smile that makes me die, and the commentary is as follows:  Yeah, Kurt was trying to make him give off that sort of ecstatic response, so when he started talking about Michael's daughter, and his face just lit up, we knew we had hit it.   WTF?  A daughter?   So, my excellent detective skills led me to IMDB, where I never really looked at his page because it didn't have any pictures.  And I looked through all the trivia, and found out some pretty interesting information.  His nickname is ""Manto"", which is the cutest thing.   Ever .  And yeah, I scroll down farther, and whoa, they have their cute little ""IMDB message board"".  Wow.  It's the most horrible thing I've ever seen.  I thought I was pretty bad, but these girls are incredibly stupid, and I can picture them sitting there typing madly, crying that he has a daughter and that they'll never ever ever get to sleep with him.  ::tear::    But apparently he's engaged.  Whether that's to the mother of his child or not, I'm not sure, and quite frankly, it really doesn't matter all that much.  But gah, talk about pathetic.  They're all like ""Well, as long as he's happy"", yada yada yada, but you could tell right behind their sugar-coated replies they're like ""DIE DIE DIE"" to the future Mrs. Michael Mantenuto.  Not that I can blame them, but it was quite ridiculous.  However, the IMDB message boards did point me to a nice little Yahoo Group about Miracle, which I shalt be looking into once I click ""publish this post""."
533707,3697773,2004-06-20,"Yes, it is I, Cindie, back in familiar territory.  My own personal blog includes ""blogspot.com"" once again, and until you look around a bit, it looks like sophomore year all over again.  The important question:  Why am I here?  It's a question that I asked myself last night, and I think I can finally answer it.  Warning:  Slightly long-winded explanation ahead.  First off, I guess its important to point out my history with blogspot, and with online journals in general.  I started my old blog (link will intentionally not be provided) in May of 2001.  I was a freshman, and I didn't feel well, so I came home from school early.  What scary things a mind can think up when sick and idle for a few hours.  Long before anyone was posting on all of those other sites (or so I think, otherwise that comment is very conceited of me), I was happy with my little home on the web.  Eventually, I learned how to customize it, and I had music, marquis lyrics, and an NHL sportsticker.  Wow, I was the cat's meow. Rawr.  After a year of this, however, the world caught up to me, and everyone (and I mean  everyone ) had a Xanga.  I jumped on the bandwagon.  It lasted all of one month.  Not that that month wasn't eventful, however.  My Xanga outlasted the entire Dave saga.  Dave?  Eh?  If you don't know, don't ask, it's not pretty.  In fact, its partially the reason why I left, and entirely the reason why I deleted every entry I had on there.  Boy am I fun!  So, back to my trusty blogger!  But I was soon dissatisfied with its lack of fun features.  The 10 layouts I had to pick from just weren't enough.  And so, when Liz introduced me to Diaryland, and Beautify, with all of its gorgeous templates, it was a match made in heaven.  I quickly packed up and moved.  But it was Summer 2003, and I had already been given a taste of Livejournal, thanks to dear darling HPB.  LJ icons?  Moods?  A comment system?  It was everything I could possibly want, and more.  IocaineSparrow was born.  However, it was inevitable for Blogger to receive a revamp, and that it did.  When Lauren talked about one of my old, dead blogs last night, I checked out Blogger again, and wow has it changed!  I can have comments, and all that other fun stuff.  All of a sudden, its much better than it used to be.  And, well, here I am!  But, but, didn't you want a paid LJ?  Yeah, I did.  But, when it came down to it, I realized I didn't need it, nor did I have much use for it.  I like making icons, but I'm pretty much content with the three I have.  I don't use the mood function, so I have no need for mood themes, and as far as adding things to the layout, well, I just did that here.    And what about the Friends Only thing?  Yeah, well, I'll have to give it up.  I kind of want my Commack friends to be able to read it.  And, if certain skeeves who shalt not be named (although its pretty obvious of whom I speak about) happen to stumble across this, well, then its back to the old LJ, no harm done.  I'll have to keep my old LJ, of course, so don't remove me from your lists!  I love reading everyone elses, and it makes me feel special to see the ones with the lock on them, muahahaha.  And yeah, there will be occasions when there are things I don't need the whole goddamn world to see, so I'll use it then.  Kudos to y'all who actually read this entire thing.  I'm hoping to stick to this one like I did the other.  So, excuse me while I go change my profile on the 4860369830863 sites I belong to.  molto amore > Cinds  P.S.  My icon journal,  urlLink Color/Blind Icons  will still be open and fully operational.  /shameless pluggage P.P.S.  To those of you who frequented my old Blog, maybe,  just maybe , the movie scripts will return.  We'll see what summer and senior year bring, eh?"
533708,3697773,2004-06-20,"I guess its about time to update this again. I've been home for the week, but I haven't bothered writing in here.  The trip was fantastic! I really had such a great time. It all went by as a blur, and I'm really not sure that its August. It feels like July never happened, and I still have two months of summer ahead of me. Yeah, right. I wish!  I started reading  Dark Debts  again last night. I'm not one to read books more than once, even though I insist on buying them, but I make an exception for some. I'm in love.

554308,1844606,2004-08-02,"Ok, on the 4th I saw a kid in a Polo with an upturned collar.  My first reaction (besides ""Jesus does that kid look like a tool) was ""who the hell is responsible for this?""  I quickly thought that it was impossible that this kid had thought of this all by himself and while I was buying khakis yesterday (for job interviews!) I was in the gap and saw upturned collars.  Talk about having mind control over fucking yuppie kids-The thought process or how I imagine it must have been something like this:  Kid walks into shop after blairing DMB from Jeep 4x4 in mechanical daze.  After seeing polo shirt with up turned collar, ""Whoa that's fucking amazing.  I bet I can really set a trend by turning up my collar.  What a great idea, I need to buy that shirt.""

554309,1844606,2004-08-02,"Last night, after little debate from drunken friends, (and the fact I just read the book ""High Fidelity"") I began to think about Top 5 lists.  In the process I realized that I actually am some form of a music snob because I can't just simply put Bob Dylan in the top 5, I have to qualify it by saying from 62-71 or that best guitarist needs to be broken down into proficiency and have a seperate list for most influence.  Top 5 songwriters is also difficult because if you want to have John Lennon on the list, then McCartney also has to be there as well right.  And Top 5 albums have to be broken down into several catagories.  I'll post my findings later.     PS  My first job out of college is going to be picking up golf balls and working a cash register."
554310,1844606,2004-08-02,"It's the only word to describe Napoleon Dynamite. I have many bones to pick. One, using a forgein kid to get laughs is not only old but now pretty un PC. Not that I'm a big stickler for PC stuff, but after Fez on That 70's show, I think it has all been played out. Two, it was positively brilliant to make a film about a dork and the preppy kids in high school. Never been done before or better. BRILLIANT. Three, there is a thing called ""plot"" and generally some ""character development"" in stories and movies. Both were lacking. Finally, relying on a kid's goofy looks for laughs for a full length movie gets old. I will also say that the viewing was somewhat spoiled by North Shore copycat mallrats decked in A&F with glowing cellphones and fake tans.   Oh yeah, I predict, if it hasn't happened already, that this will be the most quoted (rather misquoted) film for the next, let's say, 3 months. Legions of idiots who have been craving new Chappelle show quotes are now saved and will yell ""Sweet"" drunkenly in the streets. And Napoleon will be the ""hot"" Halloween costume of Frat Boys.  I hold out that this film might pull a Lebowski and become funnier on repeated viewings, but that's a slim chance.   PS  The other thing that seriously got to me about the film was the whole ""80s"" look.  Actually, that's not right, it is the fact that everything looks cerca 1985 but with the Internet.  Either the writers were trying to be clever with how everyone in that town is out of the loop, or as I suspect, they were just really lazy."
554311,1844606,2004-08-02,"I got a new cd player/car stereo the other week and with it came a free 15 song download for Napster. The other day I downloaded fifteen songs (mostly rare Wilco tracks from soundtracks and the like) and then tried to put them on my computer. Apparently, you have to be hooked up to the internet and/or continue to have napster's mandatory software installed on your computer.   This is why people steal music.   PS  After doing more research it looks like you have to have the most current version of Microsoft Media or whatever it's called.

""I've got a lot of songs finished; I've got a lot of songs half-finished; and I've got a lot of songs half-brewing,"" reveals the singer, who adds that the disc will be a more collaborative effort than before. ""Now we're this really great collective,"" he explains. ""I write the poems and then we all decorate them afterward             In case he didn't get the memo, poetry is not cool.   A complete track listing for the forthcoming  urlLink compilation CD  (due Aug. 31) inspired by The Passion of the Christ has been revealed. A collaboration between MxPx and Blink-182's Mark Hoppus joins 11 other tunes, including previously announced songs by P.O.D. and former Creed frontman Scott Stapp. ""It put my life in perspective,"" says Stapp of the film. ""When I'm feeling down or complaining or trying to place blame on certain things, I think about what Christ did for me.""           Oh Jesus   Also, don't be fooled by this new band consisting of 3/4ths of Creed.  It sucks even more than Creed, which is mighty difficult.  All music lovers hoped that when it was announced that Mr. Jesus Lover was spliting, the terrible music would stop as well.  We're not so fortunate, now we have two equally shitty bands instead of one.   In case you care, I believe I have about 225 cds."
554313,1844606,2004-08-02,"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOMMMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH  I'm pretty psyched about the trade.  I like both Boston and Cubs, but speaking from a Boston fan, jesus, what the hell were you thinking?  First, way to go with alienating an All-Star and fucking the situation (""trading"" for A-Rod) up so badly that you trade him for a couple of sub .250 hitters and some minor leagures.  In regards to Theo Epstien, how exactly is the problem ""fixed"" as you put it?  Defense might be better and you may have rid yourself of a ""problem"" by getting rid of Nomar, but you could have at least gotten equal value for him.  But maybe something is better than nothing.  If Nomar was slighted by your team President, GM, and sometimes 1B, maybe he had a right to be displeased. Rumor has it, Nomar was getting so fed up in Beantown that he considered sitting for 3 weeks while recouping from his achilles problem.  Nomar might be showing signs of slowing down after missing most of a season a few years ago with a broken wrist and is now hobbled by an achilles,  but no matter how you slice it, he is a massive upgrade over Gonzo.  On the other side, as of now, the trade can only be seen as an absolute steal.  Who knows what the prospects the Cubs gave away will become, or even if Nomar will stay past Oct (all indications are he would like to) but unless Beltran turns into the second coming of Dontrell Willis or any number of other Cubs pitching prospects that have been shipped away in recient years, this looks pretty solid.   Lets face it, Bartman was not the only reason the Cubs blew game 6 last year.  Anyone remember the ole job Gonzo pulled?  The man that was hearlded for his defensive prowless.  Yeah.  Garciaparra's bat at the top or middle of the Cubs lineup will give it some much needed consistancy and baserunners, and his defense is still solid.  If Sammy wasn't a puss he'd accecpt moving to the 5th or 6th slot in the line up and let players who hit move up and have him see better pitches.  He should also realize he's not putting the ball in play and be man enough to ask for help with his swing cause it ain't working.  More middle relief for the Cubs would have been nice, but the possibility of a waiver trade is there for the next month or so and everyone is coming back from injuries.  Once Wood and Prior are able to go 6 or 7 solid innings, the bullpen will get some help as well.  That being said, the closer job is still very loose, but I'm glad the Cubs didn't go after Urbina or Jose Mesa because neither have been consistantly reliable in the past two years.   That's my take on baseball.    PS   Moving out in 90 heat sucks massively."

The outing will be held at Sentosa. You can expect lots of fun, games, and a time to interact with members of other cell groups in our cluster. It will most probably be a half-day thing, time estimated to end is about 4-5pm. Lunch will be provided.   Please inform me or Hui Hui as to whether you are able to turn up. The amount that each person has to pay has not been confirmed yet. You will be informed at a later date. However, i assure you that each person will have to pay no more than $10. We hope to settle everything fast. Please sms  Hui Hui  or  me  ASAP to tell us if you are going. You can also leave a comment. Thank You.  -posted by Jonathan Choy-"

We would have 2 stalls if I'm not wrong,1 would be used to sell drinks and the other food.  For the food stall,we would be selling the following:  Chicken Wings--Jonathan Choy Hash Browns--Timothy Fish/Sotong Balls--Me  For the drinks stall,Hui Hui has suggest that lemonade and lime juice be sold.So the following would be needed:  Ice Containers Cups Lemons Limes  Okay so for the ice,lemons,cups and limes they would have to be bought.So we need people to buy them.Anyone who wants to buy some or all of them can sms Hui Hui or Jonathan Choy,or inform us through Msn or the tagboard here.Containers,if anyone can provide it would be good.  Oh yes,please remember to keep receipts of your purchase i.e receipts for the buying of fishballs,this is to allow us to count the profits easily.

600501,4095054,2004-08-10,"on the weightloss front im doing alright! im doing a challenge now to meet my 28pts everyday!! yes, very important and today ive met it! feels good to do that although i feel a little sceptical that any losses will happen because ive eaten under for so long :-$ damn im so paranoid sometimes. and its an unfounded paranoia, everything will go well! yes! it will all be fine.  today i wanted to list some of my favourites... junk food specifically. what i eat when things arent going well. maybe by seeing this list as one big pile of junk i will be more careful about ever overdosing again, that is the plan anyway.  favourites  icecream!! ben & jerrys' cherry garcia.  haagen daazs' vanilla swiss almond. baskin robbins' maui brownie madness. i also love chocolate chip mint from most brands & any icecream sandwich will do. when i was about 13 i would devour the oreo cookie icecream sandwiches, about 1 per day they were HUGE. of course, i was skinny back then :-P  popcorn!! of course, ANY popcorn will do but theatre popcorn is my favourite. as well as the white cheddar popcorn from the grocery store  waffels!! again, any cakey thick waffels.  i love them blegian style with high piles of whipped cream.  KFC! i eat the skin off the extra crispy and throw the chicken away, then i'll eat a whole tub of gravy with the fries.   FRIED things onion rings (anything onion & deep fried) deep fried prawns, fries--poutine with lots of gravy, the chinese pork balls with sweet & sour sauce  cookies! anything soft& chewy was a comfort to eat.  my fave was chewy chips ahoy & soft chewy oatmeal raisin.  *k starting to strain to think of things now....   chocolate.  of course this is a given but more of an indulgence than a binge, i love really nice bonbons & truffels.  fudge.  not a common occurance but i did love a bite or 2 of good quality tasty fudge.  pizza. lots of toppings, extra cheese. i did this about twice a week. sometimes more since where i worked i got a huge staff discount & it was cheaper than buying groceries.  doritos/chips type things. the cool ranch flavour is my fave, i also loved ketchup lays and salt & vinegar and i vaguely remember a crunchy ring of sorts... an onion flavoured ring chip type thing. i did buy those quite often but cant really remember them. oh and real canadian cheezies. those were a HUGE weakness of mine. they gave me the worst heartburn but i loved them.   ok. i think that about covers it. reading back over the list its almost embarrasing but i must realise that i didnt eat all those things in 1 sitting. it really doesnt make it any easier though... i feel like a huge porker, in a funny way :)  when it came to restaurants i loved the Keg, the steak & lobster. i would leave my steak & order a second lobster half :) then maybe a few bites of salad but id usually be too full after the whole lobster. i loved olive garden. i just love all italian food, we'll leave that at that. i loved chinese restaurants because of the fried foods, i loved japanese restaurants for the sushi, i loved vietnamese restaurants because i love vietnamese food.... sometimes i loved to eat a hamburger from mcdonalds! with a shake! and usually an apple pie becuase i loved those crispy warm little apple pies!  sometimes i would buy a whole box of tim hortons timbits and eat them in the dark of my bedroom after work. sometimes i would sit in tim hortons drinking 1 cup of coffee after another eating my favourites - bear claw, long john & old fashioned cake donut. occassionally with a lemon jelly wiht the white powder.  i would smoke 1 pack after the other of matinee extra lights, dipping my hand into a big box of quaker granola cereal at 4 am while i chatted away on my computer.  i knew nothing of nutrition, portion control or felt the need to have self control in teh slightest.  oh well, those days are over... its not even nice to think back to how unhealthy i was. im going to have some tomato toast & watermelon for lunch now :) tomorrow i will counter this with my favourite healthier choices these days!"
600502,4095054,2004-08-09,"well, i guess that would be me wouldnt it? yes. the horribly awful slacker that is me. no excuse, i just havent reached it! yesterday anyway. yesterday after planning dinner and everything i ended up with a grand total of 12 (of 28) soooo i thought of different ways to increase that! oh! oven fries instead of rice! thats 2 extra, i will bread my fish! thats another 1pt, use an eggwhitwash first!!! 0.5pt OOOO and a dollop of ketchup for my fries! another 0.5! so i actually ended up with 16 instead of 12 which isnt the best improvement but its a start. actually, i didnt finish all my fish *sigh*  another day though! today is that! another day indeed!!! and so far i have 14pts which leaves 14 free for dinner because these days in the heat when nothing is clean and turning on the oven or stove increases the apartment temp no less than 10 degrees its awwwwful. so! dinner is actually a spure of the moment thing. so with 14 dinner pts available thats enough for a pizza! or what have you... it probably wont be pizza because wednesday is pizza day -- pizzas are 5.50 euros on those days :D cheaper yet would be frozen pizzas in the oven, but weve tried that and they just arent as tasty and satisfying as the italian style deli pizzas! i love me some margherita. rowr. this wed. i will ask for a margherita with pineapple!!! last week was funghi maybe i can convince them im worth some pineapple YUM.  anyway enough rambling about pizza.....  overal its just been great for staying on plan these days... my pill packet says the PMS monster is due to rear its ugly head in the next week and a half or so, im not looking forward to it but i will do my best to accomodate whatever mad crazy craving is thrown my way.  also, i stepped on the scale this morning out of sleepy curiosity and im down another 1.5lb since saturday... of course nothing is official until saturday but im pretty positive, as always!"
600503,4095054,2004-08-07,"yes, its that time... and i think yesterday seeing 102.9kg  and thinking id be even lower today was  a TOUCH enthousiastic, even i must admit that. hoping for a 5lb weight loss in week 1 may seem doable for the average 230lb fat girl but usually its water weight. and since i drink 2+ litres per day it was not highly likely to have been my case so i must confess, i am THRILLED to announce a 3.62lb weight loss for week 1.  not bad,  not bad at all!! its the most ive ever lost in 1 week EVER which makes me quite happy :) i have only 3.88lb to go before i hit goal #1  of 222.5lb  which i want to make BEFORE weekend after next but know by next weekend isnt too realistic. yes, im feeling quite positive indeed! Marcel is happy for me he just wants me to keep my goals realistic which im trying hard to do.  3.88lb in 2 weeks is realistic isnt it?? almost 2lb per week?  i think its quite doable ...  the PMS monster is not due to hit for another week or 2 anyway so i feel secure & safe in my goal setting!  so a recap on the week....  i stayed within my points everyday, sometimes being a teency bit under but trying to compensate with milk or juice here & there. i used 8 of my flexpoints, leaving 27 over which is alright in my book. i tracked every meal in my notebook, did my best to compensate for the heat & lack of wanting to cook -- one day we had mcdonalds.... i got a grilled chicken salad & used only 1/4 of the dressing -- the amount of dressing in those packets is phenomenal!!!! id like to TASTE my salad thank you very much, not drown it.   it was tasty & satisfying & had lots of veggies!  so while M. had 2 mcchickens & a mcolympic greek whatever it was, i stuck to my salad & then we shared a couple wee donuts!  it was wonderful!  gilette satin care melon splash shaving gel.... dont eat it no matter how good it smells and it smells like candy...  like it belongs wrapped in bubbalicious paper   i leave you on that note."
600504,4095054,2004-08-06,"so tired... oh so so tired.  i cannot explain the feeling of exhaustion taking over my body.  its overwhelming! i lay awake until 2 or 3am then finally doze off, wanting to awake at 8 so the cycle doesnt continue. but i cant uncement my eyelids until 10! unbelievable. not that this has much to do with weightloss. well, maybe it does because come autumn/winter, im awake a lot more & therefore have many more hours in the day to contemplate food. summer just drains me completely, its very very unpleasant. its at least 80 celsius here today it must be! i cant imagine it being cooler than that :P anyway, enough complaining about the weather!  im looking forward to weigh in tomorrow, i think about a 5lb loss maybe more is on the table and im going to celebrate with some caffeine free diet coke. yes, maybe even TWO cans! im such a rebel.  my eating has been a little wonky lately i suspect because of the heat... i have no energy, no appetite.. everything is just BLAH but im getting my 2 litres of water so im pretty sure those pounds lost is not water weight. even when i started losing weight for the very first time ever about 3 years ago, i never lost that famed water weight everyone talks about... back then i was drinking 4 litres of water a day. of course i realise now i was really crazy back then and should pay no attention to those fanatic type habits.  today i made my points to 27.5! yipee! this is getting easier! still 0.5pt under but i might have some melon slices after dinner which should compensate.  when the weather cools down i want to start making exercise goals... i hate exercise *whine* but i have a gym membership thats good till about april i think & its costing 55 euros a month... i could freeze the account but they wont allow it for less than 3months at a time. and well, it'd better not be that hot for that much longer or im moving to the arctic.  so today i had a fab lunch, light & simple, low in points and utterly delicious especially with the heat! 4tbsp lowfat yoghurt, 1/2cup frozen blueberries. squirt of honey. 2pts. frozen yummy goodness ohhh it was fantastic. when i make frozen yoghurt i would throw those ingreds. into a food processor but that would have taken time which meant standing sweating in the kitchen which just didnt appeal, so i ate it like that! delish!  so if i tell you a secret, promise not to tell? ok then i stepped on the scale this morning. honestly i thought it was saturday ... THATS how tired i am and it wasnt until Marcel came home that i realised it was friday because he had some internet installation to do on friday. PHEW so anyway, the scale said 102.9kg which is 226.38 lbs which means 3.62lb lost since saturday. im very pleased! and thats why im pretty sure i'll be almost 5lb down come tomorrow morning!  such a great boost for the beginning of the journey. i'll be soooo happy to be 155lb again, honestly! and there is only 71.38lb to go! i can do that! my first goal is to hit 222.5lb and i want to do that by next weigh in... not tomorrow, but the saturday after that!  yay! although my inner fatgirl is nagging me & saying i will only lose weight this week because every week i have to decrease my food intake until im not eating anything at all to lose poundage. and that the only reason im losing weight now is because im not exercising and my body is eating all the muscle and eventually im not going to be able to walk from lack of muscle tissue, atrophyyyy she screams... atrophyyyyy. stupid ridiculous inner fatgirl. damn you. i will keep doing what im doing so shut up. hear me??? you will no longer have power over me or my decisions!!!!!! believe it :-P pppfflltt so there. hmph.  heh."
600505,4095054,2004-08-05,"mmm the silky creaminess. decadent. sensuous.  i would love a little piece right about now!  they do have fudge here but its not good and i wont eat it unless its the best and the best comes from a little place i used to know but never knew the name of!  odd, since i went there once a week for a little sample.  my mum sent M. a nice chunk of canadian maple fudge for x-mas and he loved it! i have to admit the few bites i had were exquisite indeed.  oh how i dream of the rich creamy fudginess *shudder* so sweet it burns.  just a taste. nothing more. -- i could never eat vast quantities of sweet--  chocolate is a different subject all together.  well i have to say when the fudge came to me in my dream last night i was more than happy. i swear, i could taste it when i woke up. the maple creamy wonderousness that is the maple fudge :)  ok, enough about that before i start to lose my mind.  i always said when goal weight hit (155lb) i would never ever eat any 'bad' stuff because i would not want to ruin all my efforts  but please, who am i fooling.  those things, although not required for my exsistance, are special.  and a wonderful treat from time to time.  when i was younger i would secretly buy lots of junky food with my babysitting money and sneak it into my room to eat from under my pillow in the evenings. there was a strange comfort that came along with my ritual.  being curled up on my side with a good book, sneaking chip after chip slowly out from under the blanket or pillow, trying hard not to crinkle the bag yet feeling oddly satisfied when a little crinkle came with the chip i extracted.  it was always doritos. cool ranch flavour.  if i needed something sweet it would be peanut m&ms or oreo double stuff cookies. but mostly it was the doritos.  i remember an event specifically that happened about 6 months ago? i dont remember the date exactly but i remember the event. i had purchased a bag of the cool ranch (here they are called cool american but they are still the same flavour)  to eat on saturday night while i watched my movie (bags come in 150g)  anyway, M and i had had a fight the night before, i never remember what we fight about but it was probably something petty & stupid as it usually is (although a rare occurance thankfully, i value my peace)   so after we fought, he left to do some work i grabbed my bag of cool ranch and crawled into bed with a book.   AND put the chips under the duvet cover.   im not quite sure why... i was alone. and besides, M. has worked hard to unteach my hamster behaviours because i still caught myself doing it from time to time -- that he found out about during our relationship. there was no need to hide.  so what compelled me to fall back into that pattern? i can only imagine it must have been the comfort.  *sigh*  sometimes i just dont get it.  anyway, im doing well with points. i must have used about 8 flexpoints since saturday which leaves 27 until friday night, not too bad for my first week i must admit! im quite pleased with the whole process. everything feels different this time around.  last time i lost about 19lb in 1 year (which i gained back in a matter of 2 months)  but honestly, i wasnt being true to myself or the program. i would think -- no no i'll just eat that and not count it because if it doesnt show up on paper where i & everyone can see it, then it means i didnt actually consume it.  i scoff (instransitive) at my former pathetic self.  and i never want to go back to that again, i feel very angry right now for cheating myself out of the progress i could have made.   for the summer i might have enjoyed for the first time since i moved out of Italy.   ANGRY!  i cant even talk about it.  im at boiling point and its not because of the 40degree heat enveloping me. although that certainly doesnt help.  scoff."
600506,4095054,2004-08-04,"yes, its wednesday. that time when i require a little midweek boost (or kick in the ass whatever the case may be) so i tend to step on the scale to see which direction my weight is going. lets just say this was certainly a boost! im at  103.3kg (227.3lb) which is a 1.2kg (2.6lb) drop from saturday. now by this time anything can happen by saturdays official weigh in but im feeling pretty positive! ive made it again today to 28pts without much trouble which is a wonderful thing!! it seems to be getting easier once im back into the swing of things! WEDNESDAY NIGHT PIZZA NIGHT ok you might be wondering (or not) why i want to have pizza when i just saw that fantastic review on the scale but honestly, thats part of my routine. and besides, i had such a horrible headache last night from teh heat that we ended up eating the pizza last night and tonight i'll make the chicken. so there, that was done and still not too much damage done. i had an italian style pizza funghi which is one of my faves. next to margherita. sure i do love american style thick crust heavily loaded pizzas from time to time but truth is its not that readily availble in my opinion as it is so much more expensive. besides, the lighter fare = the lighter bum and thats what im all about these days. and who can handle all that grease anyway? id be running to the bathroom all night long!! oh, was that one of those TMI moments? heh. anyway, its almost 13:30 i really must get my hummus made! yes, homemade hummus for lunch, with a couple cups of raw veggies!! i keep my hummus quick & easy, although i dont know how it can be any other way!! 1/2cup or 1cup chickpeas (garbanzo beans) couple tbsp fatfree plain yoghurt, few ( i like 5) cloves fresh garlic, cayenne pepper, paprika, lemon juice. whizz in a food processor and VOILA tasty, filling,spicey lunch that keeps vampires away... whats not to love!?!? :D"
600507,4095054,2004-08-03,"YAY! first day, while i was eating breaky i sat down and wrote out everything i would eat today -- a plan if you will then, after tallying up the points i hit 28! my daily target! without having to rack my brain and figure out where to add things to make it :D im very pleased with this...  breakfast: fruit'n'fibre with skim milk = 3pts snack: smoothie: instant coffee granules, bit of yoghurt, bit of milk, ice = 2pts lunch: tuna sarnie: 1/2cup tuna,1tbsp mixed mayo & yoghurt, 2 slices bread, cucumber=7pts snack: 1 3/4 cup strawberries, 1 apple = 2pts dinner: honey pineapple glazed chicken with rice, grilled pineapple rings & raw veggie salad=9pts snack: 6cups popcorn, 1tbsp butter & shaking of popcorn seasoning. caffeine free diet coke = 5 pts  total: 28!!!! wooooowoooooo finally! :D i have used about 5 flexpoints since saturday, with the odd snagged oreo cookie here and there which ive written in my notebook but not mentioned here. but yes, i have indeed had an oreo here & there.  im feeling pretty good! positive... of course that all usually changes when the pms monster takes over my body but hell im going to enjoy all the time i can while its not here !! i'll do my midweek validation weighin tomorrow as usual so we will see whats happened in 4 days, hopefully itll be a preview of good things to come, im definitely positive thats for sure."
600508,4095054,2004-08-02,"so im having a difficult time coming up with all my points for a day, even now that i count fruit as points!   i never seemed to have this problem in the past, maybe its just the heat is making me lose my appetite?  so far i have written out  breakfast: apple = 1pt brunch/lunch:  bowl of fruit'n'fibre with all-bran plus and skim milk = 4pts snack: tea with tsp honey & 1 kiwi = 1.5pts snack: 2 slices toast with thick slices tomato = 2pts dinner: 120g cooked prawns over 1 cup cooked pasta with 2tsp olive oil, dash of chili sauce & herbs.  2 cups raw veggies/salad with 1tbsp apple honey vinaigrette = 9pts snack: glass of skim milk with nesquick = 2pts  total: 19.5pts  :-$  eep  thats 8.5pts under...   i could have 2 glasses of milk with nesquick, that would make my daily calcium requirement. so that adds another 2.  = 21.5pts.  ummm.  1 glass of cranberry juice will bring me to my daily vit.c requirement... thats 2pts added on. =23.5pts  hmm.  would it be terrible to stop there? i honestly dont know what else to add.... i could say i'll add another cup of pasta which would bring me to 27.5pts  but im REALLY trying to get my portion problem under control  and thats my biggest priority at the moment. 1 cup of pasta is 1 portion.  not the 2-4cups i used to indulge my lazy ass in.  i hereby pronounce myself finished for the day.  4.5pts under or  not! because i have that right and my fatbutt needs to learn what a proper portion is.  so in winter my appetite increases but i exercise like MAD as well so im hoping all this will balance . why am i so thoroughly affected by the elements. great goddess i havent a clue. but im one happy camper these days despite the heat :)"
600509,4095054,2004-08-01,"i clearly have no idea what im doing...  and although i live with a computer genius hes not a webdesigner so he couldnt help me put the sidebar on the LEFT side.  the only other template i actually like that has the sidebar on the left im using for my other blogger page.  obligatory porridge.  well i want this page with the dewy leaves & dark green colours but the damn sidebar is on the right :P oh well,  there are greater problems in the world.  everythings going very well for my 3rd day on ww flexpts.  im enjoying it quite a bit actually! and although i would never admit this in public *shh you didnt hear it from me* im actually looking forward to doing some exercise when the weather cools down!  sure i can floor exercise in the airconditioned bliss of my living room & possibly some light cardio in the bedroom *winkwink* but my treadmill & bike are in a part of the apartment that is NOT airco'd and thats well... thats just unbearable!  i have no clue what to make for dinner tonight... normally i make shellfish on mondays but 1-my kitchen is a sty because im too hot & lazy to clean it. -- poor excuse considering i have a dishwasher LOL ok ok i'll get the dishes going. but that doesnt help problem 2-lack of groceries. ok thats easily remedied but it STILL doesnt change the fact that im too lazy to cook when its hot *whine* PHEW now that ive got the whine out i feel much better and ready to cook.  yes, this is just the madness you will encounter along my journey!  once i was debating whether or not to go to the gym, i stayed in bed and whined and cried and kicked my feet for like an hour with Marcel my husband tugging on my arms & saying encouraging words.   finally i got dressed and stomped & slammed doors and pouted and whined all the way to the gym. i stayed there for 1.5hrs and had a kickass workout.    go figure.  anyway! off to get those dishes in the dishwasher!!"
600510,4095054,2004-08-01,"this is something i used to suffer from. quite badly actually... i used to step on about 2093569824365 times per day in hopes of seeing some minor changes. of course there were changes and not just minor but i would gain like 6lb in the course of a day! *gasp* it was so pathetic.... well thankfully now iv gained some sort of realistic views of the whole scale situation and no longer have a driving need to step on so often. once a week is usually enough although i do enjoy having some validation half way through the week. weigh ins are first thing saturday morning, naked of course. yesterday i weighed in at 230lb which is almost my ultimate high point... which was 237.6 and not too far away from where i am now. although i know theres not much that can happen overnight in the form of a loss, i feel slimmer already! just the choice of getting something accomplished again... tracking my day, its so difficult to explain but that little purpose has given me a reason. i want to succeed! all the way this time. i have no halfass feelings. i want to live a normal life with activity and healthy foods and the occassional sunday night chinese or wednesday night pizza. and of course everyone has their down moments. i fully expect them to happen from time to time. i turn into a raving crazy lunatic about 4 days per month. the 3 days leading up to my period and the day after it begins. why not the day it actually begins? well that day my cramps are at their worse so i cant tell the difference between hunger pangs & period cramps so i usually end up eating about 1 slice of toast & 1 cup of tea through the day. but those other 4 days? BABY WATCH OUT i will eat YOU if you are standing in front of my beloved waffels with chocolate icecream. or whatever my weird monthly craving might be. so 4 days of the month i try my best to plan accordingly & when the days hit im not lost. i plan, for example this month i wanted to OD on chocolate, NOTHING was helping. so, i stuffed a wee chocolate muffin into a bowl then scooped a couple balls of belgian double chocolate chocolate chip icecream over it then i melted a few squares of black pure 70% cocoa solid type chocolate in the microwave and poured it over. i swear, its not a lot of food but you feel SO incredibly satisfied after that you dont need chocoalte for an entire month!! which is actually the point :) anyway, my cravings vary in both intensity & madness and since i have a few weeks to go i wont dwell on them!  on to other things it is still too hot to do anything so i figure even though exercise DOES help, being as tubby as i am now its possible to lose quite a bit of weight focusing just on the eating aspect. so i figure by the time it cools down i'll have lost quite a few pounds and will be ready & willing to teach myself to enjoyyyyy exercise. said with the most enthousiasm i can muster considering exercise is the bane of my exsistance. honestly. i dont hate many things but sweating is definitely one of them. unless its sauna induced... or sex. cause, well... thats just one of the fun bits!  so! considering its sunday & veryvery hot im doing quite well point wise.. its 3pm and ive used 12 which is actually a typical sunday for me! so i have 16 left to use the rest of the day to make my target. M. was edging towards chinese since we still have those cupons to use. let me see how many points in babi pangang & steamed rice.... ooo 16 for a serving of both!!!! fantastic. well, it says 1 cup of sweet&sour pork is 12 points which is more or less what babi pangang is except there is less than 1cup in 1 serving here. its more like 1.5cups for 2 people. i guess these charts are all about american servings? well i'll just adapt everything.. count a few less points. or have a bit more rice to even things out. i'll also have some soysauce which is 0 and some cold slices of cucumber which is 0. caffeine free diet coke is 0 also. it works out.  i need to drink more water! i used to drink 4 litres a day and had the best skin. now im lucky to make 2 litres and my skin hates me. 4 was too much though.. i'll focus on making 2 a steady habit then add half a litre so my bladder can have time to expand accordingly. because you know, a woman jumping to use the toilet every 5 minutes? not that attractive... and im ALL about being attractive. unless chocolate is involved. then its fend for yourself & stay out of my way!"
