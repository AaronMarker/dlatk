Welcome as a developer of DLATK!

Protocols for editing:
1. Commit often (i.e. every 30 minutes)
2. Make sure to include a commit message that breifly describes the update:
 -- if it's a bug fix, prepend message with "FIXED BUG:"
 -- if it's a feature addition, prepend message with "ADDED FEATURE:"
 These can be short but to the point, e.g. "BUG FIX: regressionPredictor working with sklearn v0.22)
3. If adding a significant new feature, create a new branch (e.g. we created dev-transformers when we first added transformers to dlatk). 
 -- be sure to add documentation

This package is maintains at the level of being prototyping; With current resources, it should not be considered on a "mature" update cycle. 
The process that the maintainers take to update public (and pip..etc...) consists of:
   1. Running unit tests that cover word DLA, topic DLA, and regression and classification
   2. A look through of the commit log to pull out key peices for change log
   3. An increment of the version number
   4. Make sure setup.py runs

Unit Test:
